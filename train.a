Overall this is a great test lead kit.  The probe wires are made of high quality flexible wire.  The alligator clips and grabber hooks are well made and connect to the ends of the test probe.  This is a great addition to an electrical tool box. These are not your cheap run of the mill clips. They are very thick and durable; solder joints on clips are good too. This product is definitely well made. My vehicle: 2004 Honda (Acura) TL 6-SPD J32A VTEC.The originals were made in the USA but these are made in Japan by NGK, or Nippon Touki (Japan Porcelain).  Iridium-tipped plugs are generally used on reciprocating powerplant-equipped airplanes.  Incidentally, Iridium/Platinum plugs are generally pre-gapped at factory and do not need re-gapping (some exceptions apply).  If re-gapped incorrectly, the tip would be damaged. 
I was looking for a Cargo bag to fit my new rear hitch cargo carrier.This unit fit well in the basket and carried lots of camping stuff.I used plastic bins to organize the contents.Even with 4 good size bins I still had room for more boxes on the 1st level.I topped it off with bedding and pillows.I liked that it didn't add too much weight as my cargo carrier is heavy to begin with.Decent quality and looks to be good water proof design. My parent's SUV is five years old now and anything can go wrong with the battery.  Initially I never really wanted to buy a portable jumper because they were all too big and expensive and the small ones looked clumsy.  I stumbled upon this one and I knew just by looking at it that it would satisfy our needs.The JNC300XL is very sleek, it's small, and built like a tank.  It's heavy (about 10 pounds.)  I have the nice little trunk bag from [...] and this fits in there with their portable air compressor (very snug at that.)  One time we were at the airport and my dad left the lights on and we were stuck in the parking lot with a dead car in a creepy area.  Luckily for us, we were parked away from other cars and a nice person helped us out with a jump.  I don't think we might be as lucky next time.  When a situation like that arises, you wish you had something like this.  Again, I'm not for carrying a bulky jump starter because I don't like my trunk cluttered with stuff.  The JNC300XL is just the right size to carry in a medium-sized trunk bag. It just feels right when you hold it.I also like how it has a built in flashlight and you can use the 12 volt outlet to power a dead cell phone or some other 12 volt appliance.  The cables are nice and are 4AWG and the clamps are very sturdy.  Removing the clamps requires a little bit of force so keep that in mind if you are not as strong as you used to be or if you have arthritis.  Griot's Garage sells this same item for one hundred dollars under their name.  The only difference is they give you a lifetime warranty and their item is red in color.  I bought this from another online retailer for fifty-eight dollars plus shipping.  So do some shopping before you buy it.I'm glad I bought this item because even though you won't use it everyday, it is a lifesaver when you need it.  Also you can help your friends and neighbors out when they have battery problems as well.  It's a fair price and the quality is outstanding. It's hard to find quality items that last these days. I'm very satisfied with this purchase. Using the XX to cover a yamaha v-star with many extras (flor boards, windshield, luggage rack, saddle bags. It's plenty big enough and not too big, very easy to put on, I don't use the bungee hooks because the elastic seems to hold good enough but they are an added bonus. Price was good just over 40 
I needed this item for an air compressor that draws 15A, and my 12V socket can only handle 10A.  This item is perfect, and small enough to fit in my air compressor's case.  It would be nice if we know how many amps it could handle, but the wire gauge provided is more than enough for my 15A need. Super heavy chain. Adjust chain so the tripod is about 6 inches lower that leveled trailer. Raise tripod using wrench included. Do not supoport full weight of trailer. This is for stabilization of the 5th wheel. In our case in provided extra stabilization for the bedroom. I was hoping this tool to be good, but it has poor design. In my honest opinion, the tool is way too big/tall and heavy because 50% of the time I can't take a tread reading because the tool is too big to fit in between the tire and the upper wheel walls on most of the cars I work on. This thing weighs like 1/2 pound and that's just way too heavy for a tire tread gauge. It does feel rock solid sturdier though, but it too difficult to use because it's hard to quickly retract the measuring point in between taking readings. 
These are great, but they didn't come with a bag.  TheTri-Lynx 00015 Lynx Leveler for RV Leveling Block with Nylon Storage Case, (Pack of 10)comes with a very nice bag that would actually work well for these wheel chocks.  It would be nice if they had included that or another bag for these (that would have earned the product 5 stars). I purchased the 12' feet long cable set and they arrived in a retail cardboard box with handle, which could be used as a storage and carrying case for these cables, although I will not need to store them with the carry box.  These are high quality long cables of high grade materials and I believe worth the price I paid for them.  They will store in the back seat storage compartment of my truck easily.  Recomend. First I want to say, the UPC tag marks this size as "small".If your wanting to store the Battery Tender Plus in this nice looking bag,I strongly suggest on ordering the Battery Tender Carrying Pouch - Large 500Large-0140.That case will hold all that comes with the Battery Tender Plusand additionally will hold the Battery Tender 25 ft extension cable with ease.The Battery Tender Plus and all the cables will fit inside this small size, 6" x 7 1/4" x 2" bag,but only a certain way, with ease and only before the cables are used.After you wrap the cables back-up, it's much harder to get everything in this bag.Lay the Tender to the right rear Conner of the bag,and it's two attached cords in front of the Tender.Lay both styles of battery clips on the left side to the rear, and the pouch can be easily closed.The inter pocket is perfect for the instruction/warranty papers.The package the Battery Tender Plus comes in is a pop-apart ~ re-usable packageand is just as good for storing the Battery Tender in, for a few yrs,and I often use pop-apart packaging on various items for permanent storage.But I know that after 4 to 5 yrs that this plastic disintegrates.Also, this Battery Tender plastic package takes up 2 ~3 times the space that the utility bag does.So this time I opted for an accessory, it's just plain fun !Footnote: After ordering and receiving this small size,I realized the difficulties to pack all the items that come with the Battery Tender Plus in this bag.I had also decided I wanted to order a Battery Tender 25 ft. extension cable.So I decided to also order the large size bag so I could hold all the original stuff, plus the extension.I've since received that order, and the large size is the one to get for ample room. 
Overall this is a great test lead kit.  The probe wires are made of high quality flexible wire.  The alligator clips and grabber hooks are well made and connect to the ends of the test probe.  This is a great addition to an electrical tool box. These are fairly solid lead cables. The cables themselves are are separate so they are an actual set or pair, where others i have worked with were still connected along the length of the main lead, each lead cable is about the thickness of a cheap USB cable.The banana clips are normal/common, the metal end is completely attached to the plastic part, i have had some where they come apart of pulled to hard, these are solid. Additionally the connection into the lead wire is very solid and non removable, i think it will hold up very well and not break lose.The alligator clip ends seem to be just fine. contrary to others results i have 2 pairs and the alligator ends are just fine, teeth all line up fine. the rubber insulator is actually fairly tight which is nice because it makes the clip easier to open and close. clips that have loose movable rubber insulator can actually be clumsy to open cause the rubber slips and slides under yours fingersOverall:Really wish they were combined leads not 2 separate wires and thicker gaugeGood cables, and i would still recommend them** If this review helped you please click the button below ** Hella Replacement.  Kinda.  Mine came with BLUE wire.. they should always be white. Its also not covered in fabric and the white ones are.

I love that you can lay it on the trailer tongue and see how your trailer is setting so you can adjust your trailer stabilizers. This along with the other two levels I have on my trailer makes it super easy to level everything up quickly... GLAD  I  WENT  WITH  THE  CHROME AND  NOT  THE BLACK ONE, I  HOOKED  THIS ONE UP TO  MY GV1400 MOTORCYCLE IF  YOU  HAVE JUST  A  LITTLE  KNOW  HOW YOU CAN  DO  IT YOUR SELF , ALL  YOU WILL NEED TO GO WITH THIS IS A RELAY THAT DOES NOT COME WITH IT. YOU  CAN  GET IT ON HERE OR ANY PART STORE, I  HAVE MADE MANY PEOPLE JUMP  DUE  TO THE SOUND OF  THE  HORNS  LOUDNESS. 
I bought this converter so as to use my &#34;Snap&#34; sat radio in my truck in the garage. The snap radio is used in the 12v power supply in my truck and to be able to use elsewhere I decided to try this out. Plus if need be it can be used as a cell phone charger. I have not used it enough to comment on quality but I have 2 other Schumacher products that are high quality. I see no reason why this product would be any different. Extension cable for inverter. Can set up inverter a good ways away from car if I need to. Just handy to have. Nice high amp (current) rating on this. I epoxy it to a 12ah  12 volt gel battery and I can use it as a jumpstarter oremergency power supply for camping or power outages. 
Works as advertised. comes with many different lug size heads and retracts to save space. The long handle is easy to use and makes taking tight lug nuts easy. I would buy this little gem again. If you decide to get this I also rcomend you get some lengths of gutter, at least 2 pieces, you can lay in on the expanded matrix so the gutter hose will not fall between the expanded sectiond.  So this and you have a great working system. Aligator clips make the battery tender MUCH more versatile.Not many batteries are able to accomodate the "2 pin plug"& this is quite dissapointing when it arrives,and it is not ready to use w/o clips.Actually Battery Tender should INCLUDE,or at least make the buyer aware that these clips are most often a must.It would be advisable for them to include this assembly,even if the price goes up  5 dollars,it is well worth getting the full compliment of accessories to get a completely functional unit. Saves time and shipping.Amazon does list these as a"most often purchased with"accessory,but it is quite essential&most people are unaware of this.On the plus side,it is a a great product,once you can use it!

Can set up inverter a good ways away from car if I need to. Just handy to have. Nice high amp (current) rating on this. I epoxy it to a 12ah  12 volt gel battery and I can use it as a jumpstarter oremergency power supply for camping or power outages. 
Wix filters are the best. They can be hard to find sometimes locally- Amazon prime is the way to go. This was 10 bucks cheaper at Amazon vs a local auto parts store.  If you use it properly and service your air filter as you should, you will not go wrong with this product. you cars computer (ECU/PCM)  monitors the tank for pressure; if you lose tank pressure,  (bad)any autostore can scan yOUR CAR for free, and see "P0440 to P0499 and others.)  EVAP failure , in laymen terms the tank leaks  fumes (nasty smog it is)you can buy a scan tool for $7 , off some bay dot com.  sure can.you can look up the error codes called DTCs at any time for free, there,http://www.myscantool.com/dtc/powertrain.htmlmy 02 jeep wrangler has a bad cap, and is on recall, (look up TSB)  and has a revised cap if buying one new from dealer.all 2002 caps are bad, they slip and will not come off, standing you.the dealer is not cheating you if you drive in , and the CEL (check engine lamp is out)  he cant fix it, if it is not broke. or throwing DTCs./These fact apply to all cars 1996 to Present, it's not something new, or unique at all.The ecu can be rest (scan tool) after replacing the cap or you can wait for 3 driving cycles to clear it. its your choice.There is a third way to reset, but varies by car, the ECU memory input power.  you pull a fuse and the ECU forgets and resets, to a new car settings.the cap has  a vacuum breaker inside, if you use a cap that has none, you will collapse your tank and destroy the fuel pump rack and sometimes the pump.so getting a real OEM spec. cap, will save all that bad news....ymmv, retired, mech. 
It does exactly what it's supposed to do. No problems whatsoever. Does what it says it does......looks great ! Not much to say, it either works or it doesn't.... this product is not rocket science and does what it claims. 
I preferr this over the other brands due to warranty. Battery Tender warranty a joke, They charge shipping and repair cost under their warranty. I replaced my Battery Tender w/ these. I have used this brand on my tractor and 4 wheelers. I am getting over 5 years of battery life on both w/ this. I've been using Purolator since, well, I can't remember NOT using Purolator; I've had cars go 300K+, trucks go 250K+, and my previous motorcycle (Yamaha Royal Star) went 165K before it got rear-ended; my present Royal Star has 155K and still runs like a new one. I have added a Ford Escape and informed the dealer that I'll be supplying the oil and filters - Mobil-1 Advanced Fuel Economy 0W-30(conforms to warranty specifications) and Purolator PureONEs. I'm hoping to make half-a-million with this one... Bought this to use withValterra F02-4100 45 RV Hydroflushso I could wash out my tanks.Here is my review of that setuphttp://www.amazon.com/Valterra-F02-4100-45%C2%B0-RV-Hydroflush/product-reviews/B0002UHVAA/ref=cm_cr_dp_synop?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints;=0&sortBy;=bySubmissionDateDescending#R2CUAU2B8XC98QIt works great.I also like that I have this as an emergency backup if one of my valves ever fails. 
Great feeler gauge!Equip it in Corrosion-X, or WD40 for long lasting.Great to measure spark plug gaps, for performing valve adjustments (valve gap), etc... The size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous. The funnel is 10" long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6" long. It states that the funnel is 4" x 4" but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2-1/4" in diameter at the widest point.It would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless. a regular 32mm socket will not fit in the space of my equinox. this is a kind of shorter 32mm socket designed only for oil filter cap job. it works fine. 
After a power outage, I connected my refrigerator to this power supply. Sadly, its inverter was unable to support my refrigerator. The Duracell DPP-600HD doesn't have enough momentary  output to handle the initial start-up current spike of a refrigerator's compressor motor. The specifications say it can momentarily provide up to 960 watts. This equates to 8 amps at 120v.  Yet, public benchmark figures for a home refrigerator's start-up current indicate 13 amps for up to 1/2 second. Other appliances that use electric motors such as sump pumps are likely to exhibit the same characteristics. My suggestion is that customers immediately test this product with any device they intend to power during an outage.Some important specifications are missing in the Amazon listing.  One of the key statics is the capacity of the internal battery, which is 28 amp-hours at 12 v.  This equates to 336 watt hours.  Yet, AC output is much lower than this presumably due to inverter losses.  These losses increase with power output.  The following table illustrates this.  The last column is my calculation.load.................watts....hours....watt-hoursCordless telephone.....5........35.0 ...175Portable stereo.........10........22.0 ...220Laptop computer.......20........7.0 ....140Fan.......................100.........1.7....17036" TV...................133........1.2 ....1603/8 drill.................300........0.4 ....115Warm-air fan heater.312........0.4 ....109Blender..................385........0.3 ....109HID Floodlights.......400........0.3.....107Observe that the total energy delivered (watt-hour) drops with power consumption.  Ultimately, the usable energy is significantly less than what is contained within the lead acid battery.For reference, a refrigerator will use about 200 watts of electricity when the compressor is running. Typical consumers will have their refrigerator running about 50% to 60% of the time, which equates to an average of 100-120 watts being consumed continuously.ConsDoesn't handle current spikes associated with certain electric motorsProsBoth AC and DC outputPortableSimple operation Very strong battery tender for the price.......has a powerful charge for my battery in a 2.9L Ford high compression motor.EXCELLENT all the way around. I ordered 2 different chargers to maintain my gate opener's deep cycle battery (a simple 4 output charger with extension cords for charging other deep cycle batteries from amazonBattery Tender 022-0148-DL-WH 12V 4-Bank Battery Management System) and this unit has a far superior charging design.The 4 bank battery tender does a simple fast rate charge then switches to a trickle charge at a constant voltage with 4 outputs.This unit pulses the battery under charge and features 3 operating modes with different current outputs for different sized batteries. The selections are motorcycle which also works well for SLA gel cells or AGM batteries, standard automotive starting battery, deep cycle batttery, and off.What makes the CTEK unit special is that it uses a pulse charge in all modes to attempt to desulphate batteries, while the battery tender does not.  This method of charging has proven successful in restoring lead acid batteries that won't take a charge any more.It comes with a waterproof 12V output cable and a set of clips or rings for permanent installation under the hood of your car.  In addition to the LEDs for indicating the type of battery being charged, a second set is provided for empty, 1/2 full, and maintenance pulse charge mode.There is also a noticable increase in quality between the battery tender and this unit - small details like a water sealed housing and gaskets on the connectors indicate quality in manufacture.For a single 12V lead chemistry battery this is a useful, well made tool.

REPLACE THEM AT 90,000 MILES AND ENGINE FEELS SMOOTHER AND MORE RESPONSIVE... I CHECKED ON ACDELCO CATALOG AND GAVE ME THIS PART NUMBER FOR MY TRUCK..REPLACED THE SPARK PLUGS WITH IRIDIUM AC DELCO AS WELL.. This is the review I did when these filters were sold in "packs of 2" There are some mistakes which i will highlight in brackets.These filters (PL20195) were bought as a replacement for the Toyota filters that are found on the 2.5L D-4D diesel engine in the Toyota Hilux pickup truck. They are of a very high quality as judged by the sealing gasket, the anti-drain back valve and its weight.Filter is being used with Mobil 1 Delvac 15W-40 (edit: it was actually 5W-40) Fully Synthetic engine oil and the engine noise has certainly reduced from its previous dino based lubricant.In my country, the Toyota dealership(TTTL) charges about US$28 for one filter; purchasing online and having the filters shipped cost me about US$13 for one.I highly recommend this filter as a high quality replacement that doesn't break the bank or if you plan to extend oil drain intervals.Now the technical stuff for people that want to know:PL20195 = PL20064 minus the pressure relief bypass valve (exactly the same dimensions)PL20195 is a longer version of the PL10241PL20064 is a longer version of the PL10028 (edit: the PL10028 doesn't have an antidrainback valve)The larger the filter usually means:1)that it takes longer for the oil pump to fill it.2)that there is more filter medium to trap more contaminants out of your oil3)that the oil will pass through the filter medium slower4)theoretically that a higher RPM will be required to activate the filter bypass valve (which means that you can rev your engine slightly higher without the oil bypassing the filter medium) - this really depends on the PSI that the pressure relief valve was designed with, but if a small filter and a larger filter have the same PSI value for the "relief" then this theory should hold true.Today the filter is currently being used with Shell Rimula R4 15W-40 for 8000Km oil change intervals This is used on my 93 GMC pickup. The old filter looks really good, but I installed a new tank/pump/sender assembly so I have to and would anyway install a new fuel filter. Fits in like the original and never will need replacing again. 
A nice charger. Is also smaller than it appears on the picture. So easy to carry and handle.Unfortunately I had to send it back because it just has the standard clamps to charge.There were no &#34;Quick Disconnect Extension&#34; option to easy plug-n-charge a motorcycle.So I bought the &#34;Black & Decker BM3B 6V and 12V Battery Charger / Maintainer&#34;:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051D3MP6/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0 Always AC Delco for my GM vechciles!

It has enhanced the night driving experience.  I replaced the 2007 Odyssey with this new set of bulbs.  It is bright and legal.  I tried the silver star but it wasn't brighter so I returned it.  Definitely buy it here on Amazon.  Autozone is selling at retail which is $49.99.  For the price there, you can buy 2 sets here with change left over.I also got the 9005 for the high beam for my 2009 Honda Civic Hybrid.  But I used installed HID kit for my Civic instead and not use the 9006.  But I actually think for budget minded people, this set of Ultra 9006 looks better than the Xentec HID I got.  For $22, you can't go wrong with this.  Buy it and you'll be glad you did. Bought this charger to replace the rediculous charger that comes with power wheel cars and trucks. Had to do some minor wiring connector swaps, but this charger is soooo much faster and actually let's me know when the battery is done! Terrific charger, I would buy another!!! Can't beat the price and functionality...... I purchased these to replace my Taylor WiresTaylor Cable 72205 Red Custom 8mm Spiro-Pro Ignition Wire Setbecause they were over 8 years old and I wanted to give AC Delco a try. I coupled these with the AC Delco 41-110 plugsACDelco 41-110 Professional Iridium Spark Plug, Pack of 1, and my truck runs like it did when it was brand new (over 13 years ago)!!! Even though I have done a lot to the truck as far as engine upgrades, these plugs and wires complimented all my upgraded components. Thanks again Amazon for selling the parts I need to keep my truck running like new. 
I use it every year to maintain the charge on the lawn tractor batteries.  Doesn't take too long and the indicator lights make it easy to know when the battery is fully charged. How can one really rate it, as it is used for protection and no idae how long it should last, yet is was as listed so I give it the benifit ogf the doubt... I am very happy with this charger. It will constantly display either the charge percentage or current battery voltage.  I tried to charge an old jet ski battery with it and it was able to tell me the battery was bad.  I have three diesels and they have large batteries. This is capable of putting a good charge on them when dead in only a few hours.  The cords are long enough to set the charger outside the car, so you can close the hood when charging.  My only complaint would be that the clamp jaws don't open wide enough to grab a large battery terminal clamp. 
I own several vehicles and motorcycles and I had one of the pre china battery tenders and it lasted for several years. it did so well I bought 3 more of the battery tender pluses at one time at Christmas 2010.one worked for about 9 months and then would not go into the float mode. It killed the battery from overcharging. hooked up the next on a different battery and it worked about 2 weeks before doing the same thing(not going into float mode).  the 3rd one lasted less than a week........... each has a 10 year warranty so I phoned deltran and spoke to their "tech". he cannot understand my problem........ tried on different batteries. plugged into outlet first blah ,blah ,blah. I paid over $100.00 for 3 of these Chinese junk chargers.I can send them back and they will check at my cost if nothing is found wrong I would be charged a service fee and return shipping. poor customer service ,bad quality. for what these cost they should last.Do yourself a favor and do NOT buy these battery tender chargers........Update: 1-15-2014 buy an xtreme charger......I have 3 of the red xtreme charger, see my review ........ I have ordered two of these chargers for maintaining my batteries on my ATV and Riding Mower in the winter months last year and they have done great. I have three more on order right now for more coverage on new Tractor, another ATV and anotherriding mower as well. I also have two maintaining chargers mounted on my boat that are Schumacher brands that have never failed me in the last three years of storing my boat.I also have one Schumacher  Quick Charger for jumping and starting dead batteries. I have never been disappointed with any of the Schumacher chargers at all. My late Father used to use only this brand, and that is why I continue using the Schumacher brand!How can you go wrong with Quality products!!All of my chargers have been ordered from Amazon.com where most of everything I oder comes from. Great service and products all around. I bought this charger to replace my old one which lasted 18 years and was used at least twice a week in our shop. The new one ways half of what the one did, so I hope it will last as long. This is a great charger, the only thing missing from it, is an automatic shut off, for when the battery is completely charged. But for 1/2 the cost of our old shop charger I Will Take It.  So far so good. 
Bought this because I wanted to measure the length of a specific body part of mine.  Unfortunately a ruler was too big to measure the length of it.  I needed something very small in order to figure out how long it is. I bought two sets / 4 total. I use them near the middle of the lifting range which puts the saddle about 18 to 19 inches high. This is perfect to get my truck off the ground and give me an inch or so of ground clearance to R&R; the tires and do other work underneath the vehicle.I don't need 6t worth of lift, but I like how these j/s have a wide lifting range. With these set for my range (as stated above), they are not teetering at the top of the range like others I've used in the past, but are comfortably in the middle. They are very stable and solid units.It would be helpful if the info stated the lifting range of the units, not just the tonnage they can support as a pair.Min. Lift Height (in.)14 29/32Max. Lift Height (in.)23 1/2 Sizes listed in reviews and the two in the description (15.8 x 10.5 x 5, and 12.5 x 9.5 x 7) don't match to what I received...The bag I received is in between what has been listed in the descriptions:  13.5" x 9" x 6" (empty).While seemingly a good quality bag, with a fair amount of straps and attached rain-cover (hidden in the heel of the bag), it seems the manufacturer (or seller) has no idea how to use a measuring tape!The bag itself is quite nice... good padding, rubberized bottom to prevent sliding, small pockets on either side, and zippers seem of reasonable quality.For the price and bag quality, I'm not complaining.  It works great on my CB750, and it does fit on the pillion of my VT1100c2 (without having to remove my rider backrest)  So if you have standard seating (or a touring/adventure style), this bag will do well for you as a pillion bag, and with a little strap adjustments, it also fits vertical on the front or back of a sissy-bar, or horizontal on a larger luggage rack... 
The worst possible thing to do to a lead acid battery is to let it fully discharge.  I keep Battery Tenders on all my equipment batteries and have never had a battery fail in less than 8 years.  I did have one Battery Tender Jr go bad but the company replaced it for the $7 shipping fee. I did a bit of research before purchasing this product. If you want a quick charge, I have read that your battery won't last as long. For battery life, the ideal charge is low amerage.  I appreciate that this charger provides a low amp charge to the battery. I had an older battery charger that I believe prematurely destroyed one of my 12v batteries, so I did my best to find the best value replacement. As a matter of fact, the way I saw the older charger behaving (according to my digital multimeter), I was concerned that it could cause the battery to explode or start a fire. I decided to get a new one. I looked at all of the battery chargers I could find on Amazon and other sites. Eventually, I settled on this particular model for these reasons:1. Provides a low amperage charge, which is supposed to help prolong battery life.2. Desulphination mode, which is supposed to help prolong battery life.3. Safety shutoff features, so that it doesn't overcharge the battery.4. Reads the battery polarity and illuminates a red light if you have it reversed.5. Excellent review on Amazon and other sites that sell battery chargers.I've only been using the battery minder for a couple of months, but I think it is working well. The recharges and maintenance modes seem appropriate. The batteries seem to last a long time after I charge them. This product seems to be living up to the claims and ratings. I am impressed. This is a very nice charger for many batteries, BUT it states AGM (not good for many). An AGM 12VDC VMAX, or Optima type RV or marine battery requires a special charger that will deliver 25-35 Amps, not 8. This is for a very small AGM battery. This cost over $120 and I will use it for regular flooded lead batteries but must buy another for AGM or Gel batteries for my RV. A specialty battery requires a specialty charger, I found out. I do recommend this, would buy again, and I hope this helps. 
The picture on Amazon site is not correct. This battery monitor shows the voltage value with .01 precision (or two digits after decimal point). That is far more then enought to tell the battery status. I put it in the car, it automatically switches between "battery status monitoring" and "charging status monitoring". When the engine is stopped, it is in "battery status monitoring mode", when engine is running, it will be in "charging status monitoring" mode. Amazon's price is even bettern then Walmart. Definitely a great value buy. Will recommend this item to my friends.--- Update ---Amazon has updated the new photo for the product. The picture is correct now. I ordered 2 different chargers to maintain my gate opener's deep cycle battery (a simple 4 output charger with extension cords for charging other deep cycle batteries from amazonBattery Tender 022-0148-DL-WH 12V 4-Bank Battery Management System) and this unit has a far superior charging design.The 4 bank battery tender does a simple fast rate charge then switches to a trickle charge at a constant voltage with 4 outputs.This unit pulses the battery under charge and features 3 operating modes with different current outputs for different sized batteries. The selections are motorcycle which also works well for SLA gel cells or AGM batteries, standard automotive starting battery, deep cycle batttery, and off.What makes the CTEK unit special is that it uses a pulse charge in all modes to attempt to desulphate batteries, while the battery tender does not.  This method of charging has proven successful in restoring lead acid batteries that won't take a charge any more.It comes with a waterproof 12V output cable and a set of clips or rings for permanent installation under the hood of your car.  In addition to the LEDs for indicating the type of battery being charged, a second set is provided for empty, 1/2 full, and maintenance pulse charge mode.There is also a noticable increase in quality between the battery tender and this unit - small details like a water sealed housing and gaskets on the connectors indicate quality in manufacture.For a single 12V lead chemistry battery this is a useful, well made tool. I put a new battery in my car last year.  I don't drive very much, so having a good battery is important.  During winter, my car sometimes has trouble keeping enough of a charge on the battery to start.  This battery charger mitigated the problem completely.  The display, while only 3 digits, provides better information than most other units because it can display either the Voltage coming off the battery, or the estimated current charge, as a percentage.I charged my battery at the 10 Amp rate, and it took less than 2 hours, and informed me it was complete with a little green light below the display.  In the past, I've used a much older charger, which took a whole night to charge a car battery.  Instead of ruining an entire evening, now I can charge my battery when I get home from work, and leave after eating dinner!The only thing I would like to see the manufacturer improve is the manual.  They wrote one manual for a whole line of chargers, which makes a lot of the information in it not relevant to the specific charger you've bought.  Here's an example: they include a table that shows the estimated charging time for different sized batteries at different charging rates.  The table includes many output-amperages that this unit cannot produce: 4, 6, 8 Amps, etc.  Also, the manual discusses a switch to set the charger in either 6V or 12V mode, but this model does not include such a switch.  I inferred that the unit can determine the type of battery you connect, but this is not explicitly stated.**NOTE** in a comment below, I was informed that this model does not support charging 6V batteries.  I haven't tested or verified this claim but I don't intend to find out the hard way: improperly charged batteries can explode, and usually contain harmful substances.  Please be careful. 
We leave our GMC at home while we take our RV to Florida every winter.  I leave a battery tender attached to the battery and it keeps the battery at the correct charge rate.  Seems to extend the battery life also.  Very happy with this one as I have used them for many years now and they have never let me down. POWERFULI have a full sized 4wd pickup truck 5.7 L V8 engine.  When the battery went dead over at my parents house their jumper cables from their car wouldn't give enough juice to start my truck.  My dad put his charger on my battery overnight but still the truck wouldn't start.All the technical diagnostic advice I got from everyone was wonderful but I know what a dead battery is and I was sure that was the problem.Since I left my JNC jump box in my other vehicle I came back the next day and said let's give it a try with my &#34;jump box&#34;.  Needless to say it fired right up.The battery was truly dead and would not take a charge whatsoever.Jumper cables from another &#34;smaller&#34; vehicle would not supply enough cranking amps to start my truck... but the JNC had power to spare.I have used it several times over the past year and a half since I made my purchase.  It has not failed me.  I have used it to start my lawn mower, my tractor, my neighbors car, and even some stranger in the parking lot. Our Battery Tender Plus is on a shelf in the garage, and the RV with its battery is parked outside.  This cable runs from the charger to the wall of the garage, down to and thru a vent hole in the wall, then across the driveway, under the RV, then up front to the battery box.  It turned out to be just long enough.  When we leave on a trip, I turn off the charger, then coil the cable beside the garage till we return.  We no longer worry about fast-charging the battery every month or so during the winter to keep it from freezing. 
Another reviewer mentioned this charger puts out 15.0V in AGM mode and that's too many volts for some AGM batteries and it caused his to outgas (reducing the battery's life).  My Optima yellow top AGM battery is rated for 15V charging so I thought this charger would be okay for it, but the charger I got puts out 15.5V!  I did find specs that say 15.6V "regulated voltage" is okay for "rapid charging" on my battery but they don't define what rapid charging means.  They do say with 15.6V to "charge until current drops below 1 amp" which I think means you can do 15.6V until the battery gets closer to being charged and stops accepting high amperage.  Unfortunately this charger does the exact opposite, starting at lower voltage and increasing to 15.5V around when it decides the battery is at 90% charge (which seems to equate to about 12.6 or 12.7V on my battery).  The charger keeps outputting 15.5V until the battery is fully charged, which may take hours, so it seems unlikely that's good for most batteries and I'm pretty sure it's against the charging specs on my battery.  Note that the charger shows 15.4V on its readout but my volt meter shows it's actually 15.5V.Nevertheless I let it keep doing 15.5V and checked periodically to make sure the battery wasn't hot (it never even felt warm and an IR temperature gun read 86F max) and wasn't hissing (hissing would mean it was overcharged and releasing gas, permanently reducing its life).  It took almost exactly 12 hours for the charger to decide it was 100% charged and go into maintenance mode, but when it did, it picked 12.4V!  AGM batteries are supposed to be charged at around 13.6V for maintenance (float) charging, so I have no idea why it picked 12.4V.  I left it on for another hour and it actually reduced the voltage to 12.3, at which point I took it off the charger.  Volt meter said the battery was at 12.31V.I can't decide if this charger is broken, has a weird charging algorithm, or is actually very smart.  I say that because my battery was discharged to about 3.5V a few weeks ago, well below the voltage it's designed to be discharged to (it's a "deep cycle" but even deep cycles don't tolerate discharging below 50%, and even below 10.5V may hurt them), so it's now damaged and won't hold the full 13.6V it's supposed to.  Instead, if I leave it on the charger at 15.5V for an hour, it hits 12.8V and then quickly loses charge to 12.5V in about 30 minutes.  So maybe the charger somehow figured that out and decided that 12.4V was "full charge" on my damaged battery so that's what it used as its float charge.  I don't see how it could determine that if the battery was 12.8V or higher after the long 15.5V charge, but who knows.I also don't know if 15.4V is really bad for my battery, or for the "average AGM".  I spent awhile researching but couldn't find any real authoritative information, just a bunch of people theorizing.  Since it's above the 15V standard charge on the battery spec sheet I don't think it's a good thing, but then again I also found research (nrel dot gov/vehiclesandfuels/energystorage/pdfs/evs17pres.pdf) showing that seriously overvolting a yellow top battery to 17V under certain conditions actually increases its life.  So I don't know what to think, but I'm leaning towards thinking it's a bad thing to go against the manufacturer's spec sheet unless you're in a lab using specialized chargers.What I do know is that the desulfination feature on this charger didn't do a thing for my damaged battery.  In fact I don't think it even kicked in.  I connected the charger to a small sealed lead acid battery that I left unused for too long and it went into desulfination mode (I think - the manual doesn't say how you're supposed to know) for over 8 hours pumping 16.8V into the battery until it said "bad bat" on its screen and stopped charging.  In all that time the battery never showed over 15% charged on the charger, though it did end up holding about 10.9V.  In my online research it was mentioned in a few places that there are no studies showing desulfination actually works so I'm pretty dubious about it.  It definitely didn't work on either of my batteries.It was also interesting to note that the sealed lead acid battery never got warm, which I find rather curious considering how long it was putting in such a high voltage.  I had the charger connected to a kill-a-watt meter and it showed the charger was pulling only 0.15amps and 9watts, and this is in 2amp charging mode, so maybe the charger is smart enough to use low amperage when it's using high voltage and that prevents the battery from getting damaged.  When it was pushing 15.4V to my AGM battery it was only drawing 0.35amps and it actually reduced the amps to 0.29 as it got closer to 100% charged.  So maybe that protects the battery from overvoltage damage, but I don't know enough to be sure.  Maybe a battery expert will chime in in the comments.Another important thing to consider is that desulfination mode could damage your car's electronics if you don't remove the battery from the car to charge it.  16.8V is more than most cars were designed to handle, and I found someone mentioning that BMW warns not to use chargers that do things like that, so it's definitely a concern.  I don't know if I feel comfortable using this charger again without removing the battery from the car.  Some chargers claim to somehow magically detect the presence of car electronics and limit their voltage, but this charger says nothing about that in its manual.Other than all that, the design of the charger is nice.  Wires fit into a pocket beneath the retractable handle.  It will show you the battery voltage on its readout until you tell it to start charging (although it reads 0.1 to 0.2V lower than my volt meter, which is annoying).  A button lets you toggle between display of voltage or battery percent.  It lets you choose standard, AGM, and gel cell, and choose from three rates of charge.  The slower 2A charge rate is supposed to be better for many batteries, so use 2A or 6A if you aren't in a hurry.  I tried both those modes and it still puts out 15.5V in 6A mode but it puts out 15.3V in 2A mode.Since this is a dedicated 12V charger you don't have to worry about it "autodetecting" (actually, auto-misdetecting) your discharged 12V battery as a 6V and never charging it past 6V, which is a problem with far too many chargers these days.Despite its nice controls and smart form factor, I give this charger a low rating because I think it tries to push some batteries beyond their limits in the name of charging them as quickly or as fully as possible.  One reviewer said it caused his AGM to outgas and another said it burnt out his battery after a few months of trickle charge mode.  If you have the right brand of battery that can handle this charger's output, and your battery isn't damaged, it's probably fine, but the fact that it can damage things and may even damage car electronics in desulfination mode strikes me as very bad design, especially given that desulfination seems like more of a marketing ploy than a valuable feature.  I also don't like that its volt meter reads 0.1 to 0.2V under actual voltage. I purchased the Battery Tender 800 Waterproof 12V Battery Charger because it is &#34;Waterproof&#34;. I keep it attached to my motorcycle that does not know to come in from out of the rain. Bike likes and I like. :-) I did a bit of research before purchasing this product. If you want a quick charge, I have read that your battery won't last as long. For battery life, the ideal charge is low amerage.  I appreciate that this charger provides a low amp charge to the battery. I had an older battery charger that I believe prematurely destroyed one of my 12v batteries, so I did my best to find the best value replacement. As a matter of fact, the way I saw the older charger behaving (according to my digital multimeter), I was concerned that it could cause the battery to explode or start a fire. I decided to get a new one. I looked at all of the battery chargers I could find on Amazon and other sites. Eventually, I settled on this particular model for these reasons:1. Provides a low amperage charge, which is supposed to help prolong battery life.2. Desulphination mode, which is supposed to help prolong battery life.3. Safety shutoff features, so that it doesn't overcharge the battery.4. Reads the battery polarity and illuminates a red light if you have it reversed.5. Excellent review on Amazon and other sites that sell battery chargers.I've only been using the battery minder for a couple of months, but I think it is working well. The recharges and maintenance modes seem appropriate. The batteries seem to last a long time after I charge them. This product seems to be living up to the claims and ratings. I am impressed. 
My last same-sized container anti-seize, standing at attention, lasting me 30 years (home use), so my children will finish this one.About it:It's silver in color, 8-oz. container (a bunch), -65F - 1600F, Anti-Seize, -Corrosion and -Galling; has Lid Brush; label indicates "Made in USA".Specific Use: Ease assembly and disassembly of hardware which experience extreme temperatures and/or corrosive conditions.I've used this routinely, and sparingly for it does not take much - just a light swipe on threads, mating surfaces etc.  Most of my last container went to lubricating boat and boat engine components for very good saltwater corrosion prevention.A general caution is: not apply to business end of sparkplug, O2 sensor etc (lightly on threads/sealing surface only) - else could impact component performance (never seen it happen lol).*UPDATE: I visited Permatex website - wished I'd done so earlier ...

Amazon's Parts Locator says that the Motorcraft  FL820S does not fit my 1995 Mercury Grand Marquis, 4.6 Litre V-8 engine. This is incorrect. The fact is that the Motorcraft FL820S is the FORD-recommended filter for my 1995 Mercury engine, and is recommended in almost every application of the Ford /Mercury/Lincoln 4.6 Litre engine size.The Motorcraft FL820S interchanges with the BOSCH 3410, the FRAM TG2, and the K&N; 2010.The Motorcraft FL820S  has over 50 pleats, high flow rate, silicone anti-drainback valve, and steel end caps.Amazon's current low price ($3.69) is an excellent value for a quality oil filter that's MADE IN USA !!My car is driven in heavy traffic, desert temperatures, mountain driving, and trans-desert trips from Phoenix to L.A.The standard FORD Motorcraft Filters performed just as well as the high-dollar types -- and filtered MUCH better than the K&N;, which has a very high flow rate (for racing), but the low 90% efficiency rating of the K&N; makes it a no-no for extended oil changes. I wouldn't run a K&N; oil filter for more than 3,000 miles -- you'd just be stirring up dirty oil and pumping it through the bearings !! :>(For my American V-8 engine, I have found the best value to be the Motorcraft FL820S Oil Filter and Mobil 1 5-W-20 Extended Life (Synthetic) engine oil. The quality of the oil filter allows for filter changing every 5,000 miles, and the engine oil is changed once-a-year, regardless of miles driven.For maximum oil life, be sure your PCV system is working properly -- Remove and wash out the PCV Valve with Carburetor  Cleaner, and check for collapsed and/or damaged PCV hoses.

Bought this charger to replace the rediculous charger that comes with power wheel cars and trucks. Had to do some minor wiring connector swaps, but this charger is soooo much faster and actually let's me know when the battery is done! Terrific charger, I would buy another!!! Can't beat the price and functionality...... The &#34;Battery Tender 021-0128 Battery Tender Plus 12V Battery Charger&#34; is a best buy.  It does everything they say it will do.  The add for it is not over blown and it did bring my battery back to life.  I am really glad I got it; This is a must-have if you have a wall charger as the length is great and if your battery is not close to the charger. I use mine for charging my RV truck battery and the house side battery at the same time, as I have a Battery Tender 'Y' for charging more than 1 battery. This is heavy-duty and works for both my Battery Tender plus and my Battery MINDer's; at a great price. I highly recommend this, and the Y for 2 or more batteries, would buy again, and hope this helps someone. 
California 2000 V6 Camry with P1150 and P1155. Two of my code tables show as Bank 1 Sensor 2 A/F sensor so I ordered the Denso 234-4209 O2 sensor. Came in on time and package well protected but looks like its the wrong one - my fault, somewhat. Turns out, as far as I could tell, my two tables from two different sources had it backwards as it should be Bank 2 Sensor 1 A/F and Denso/Amazon order check didn't help much either.Anyway, Bank 2 Sensor 1 is the one on the engine right front (easy to get to) where Denso refer as Upstream Front. I gave it 5 stars base on previous experience, will order this one later.Why the a few of you refer as Bank 1 Sensor 1 and still corrected the check engine light? That would not be this one for the the Toyota V6 but Denso 234-9007 where they refer as Upstream Rear. Am I wrong?Seems like I'm not the only one confused based on superceeded information on P1150 and P1155.This one is for Bank 2 Sensor 1 for the Toyota V6 engine (mine is the 1MZFE). I never had faith in the little digital transducers or tire gauges. This one really changed my view. It is compact, accurate and readings are very reproducible . My only recommendation is to switch the power source to conventional batteries instead of the 4 button batteries.Excellent product The 3rd generation powerprobe includes a number of changes for additional flexibility.  In short, it is a vehicle powered DVM with both a 20 foot cable and an additional 20 foot extension giving you a 40 foot working range around either the battery terminals or cigarette lighter outlet, both clips and a plug are included in the kit.With the series 3 units they use a hard gold plated banana jack to hold the removable probe or cables to extend your reach.  If you purchase the accessory kit, it includes piercing probes that self center on a conductor, pierce the insulation, and attach to the jack allowing you to tap a wire at any point to locate intermittant problems.While the DVM is backlit all the time, it also has 2 bright white LEDs facing forward to aid in finding and probing terminals in dark places.  The actual probe is hardgold plated with a sharp tip and removable at the banana jack.  Another identical probe is included with a screw-in female banana jack in the accessories kit to retrofit the powerprobe I and II units to accept external cables and probes.If you need to excite a circuit with a connection to battery ground or to battery positive, the switch allows a momentary connection to bridge the probe tip to either voltage which is useful in testing relay driven circuits, indicator lights, and other small current loads.  The prope voltage is always displayed during testing on the meter. The voltage/ground switch is circuit breaker protected in case you accidentally drive 12 volts into a chassis ground.  Additionally, since the switch takes abuse it is easily replaced if it fails with just a screwdriver.Combined with the testlead set, the powerprobe 3 greatly simplifies testing of vehicular wire and big rigs up to a single trailer.  The DVM has 5 selectable modes of operation designed for different problems.  Reading the manual is important to get the full value from this meter.Although the price is a little high, the design and construction quality are excellent.  Enough wire is provided to check running lights on trailers or to look for blown fuses.  All of the wiring is exceptionally flexible and heavily insulated with top quality connectors.  Both the tester and accessories come in hard plastic cases that can be stowed in a service box.Not mentioned in specifications is that although the probe runs from 12-24 VDC, the meter can be used to measure voltages up to 80VDC. 
Works great, nice to have a second cable, but the OBD end of the cable is angled.  In my case, this cable won't work on my Subaru Outback.  I would prefer the option of a straight OBD connector.  Note that the angle connector works on my other four cars (Mazda, Honda, Dodge). This makes it SO easy to charge in conjunction with my battery tender.  So far it has fit all my vehicles batteries ( Acura integra, Toyota Tundra, Toyota Pickup ) I used this controller to replace the horrible factory dodge controller in my 2010 ram 2500. This controller is worlds ahead of the factory controller in terms of features and available settings. If you are hauling a large trailer it is a must have. The boost function is a great feature that applies the trailer brakes ahead of the truck brakes. You can set boost to 3 levels to meet your desired brake feel. My fiver weighs around 2500lbs more than my truck and between this controller and the exhaust brake stopping is effortless. 
Great wheel lock that is easy to activate and unlock.  It comes with 3 keys, one of which has a LED light on it.  The product also comes with a reminder cord that attaches to the handle bar as a reminder.  It does just what I was looking for. A must have to replace oxygen sensors. Makes the process so easy that even a caveman can do it. The sensors were in a unreachable spot to use a wrench so this socket really came in handy. The best battery disconnect switch I have used. Very positive switch positions. Easy to install. You need a good electric drill - drilling into the steel frame on an RV can be a daunting task. 
A nice charger. Is also smaller than it appears on the picture. So easy to carry and handle.Unfortunately I had to send it back because it just has the standard clamps to charge.There were no &#34;Quick Disconnect Extension&#34; option to easy plug-n-charge a motorcycle.So I bought the &#34;Black & Decker BM3B 6V and 12V Battery Charger / Maintainer&#34;:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051D3MP6/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0 You can't say much about this quick disconnect plug.

Good insurance for a transmission, especially in a harsh environment, or towing situations. Cheap price to delay a costly repair job.

These things are rated 8,000lbs but that's for ( GVW ) so while it's correct technically in reality each item is rated by the label at 2,000lbs per each item and if you had 4 (they sell them in pairs), if you had 4 of them you could put 8,000lbs on them, technically and according to them.****I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO RELY ON USER REVIEWS TO GET THE INDIVIDUAL WEIGHT RATING!!!!***GVW is a very deceptive and dangerous way to market and label these products.  Consider this, on a truck, the majority of the weight is on the front two wheels while the rear wheels don't have as much weight - same is true on a front wheel vehicle.  This leads to situations where you could overextend the capacity of these products.I'd like a very clear rating: 2,000lbs, 4,000lbs, 6,000lbs for each stand or ramp on Amazon so that I know how much weight I can safely put on it similar to what is found on jacks....a jack is not labeled as 6,000lbs if it can lift a 6,000GVW vehicle, 6,000lbs means that the jack can lift 6,000lbs!After all, I'm planning to get under these things!!!!On items like this where someone's life very literally depends on the labeling ---  it would be really really really nice (and a legal requirement) that the specifications on Amazon very clearly stated both the operating weight, maximium weight, and crush (failure) weight per each ramp/stand versus this GVW rating which is deceptive and just plain dangerous.I have very literally found people working underneath 8,000lbs trucks without the wheels using jack stands sold as "2ton" when in reality each jack stand was only rated at 1ton or 2,000lbs.....their comment back, "this is a 2 ton stand and 8,000lbs GVW divided by 4 is 2,000lbs or 1ton, plenty of margin."  When in reality 6,000lbs are up front....3,000lb for each wheel  and each stand rated at only 2,000lbs....making their jack stand 150% overloaded! --- horrendously scary (all because marketing is so bad in this area).  Yes people should exercise care in using double protection and users should Always read their instructions and warning before putting their life on the line -- but for the love of God, there is a responsibility on the makers and marketers of these products to label them very clearly and in bold with the weight that EACH can hold and Amazon should post that weight for each item in BOLD Yellow or Orange wording with very clear warnings.Amazon and automotive sellers on Amazon need to get on the ball regarding the needs of auto ethusiasts and for the safety of the weekend mechanic who should not have to do complex math to figure out how much weight each item can hold!We REALLY need to get away from GVW, it's deceptive and dangerous!****I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO RELY ON USER REVIEWS TO GET THE INDIVIDUAL WEIGHT RATING!!!!*** Bought this because I wanted to measure the length of a specific body part of mine.  Unfortunately a ruler was too big to measure the length of it.  I needed something very small in order to figure out how long it is. I bought two sets / 4 total. I use them near the middle of the lifting range which puts the saddle about 18 to 19 inches high. This is perfect to get my truck off the ground and give me an inch or so of ground clearance to R&R; the tires and do other work underneath the vehicle.I don't need 6t worth of lift, but I like how these j/s have a wide lifting range. With these set for my range (as stated above), they are not teetering at the top of the range like others I've used in the past, but are comfortably in the middle. They are very stable and solid units.It would be helpful if the info stated the lifting range of the units, not just the tonnage they can support as a pair.Min. Lift Height (in.)14 29/32Max. Lift Height (in.)23 1/2 
The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around! Put on 2009 Street Bob.  Stickers came off fine.  Fits at the A section of the front frame, little hole there.  Find a bolt, done.  (Well, that and plug it in). The pin (10mm) is too wide for the disc brake holes and the disk is too wide for the lock to easily slip on and off without damaging the dick bake itself. Great lock for other bikes I suspect, but not designed for thick brake disks with smaller holes. 
I tried this one one of my tires when I unboxed it, and when it shut off the display would never come back on.  I was ready to give up right there until I saw another reviewer had a similar issue, and that it would work again after being unplugged from power and plugged back in.  Right there, that makes this unit a fail for me since if you have to remove power between wheels, it becomes much more of a pain to deal with.  But a few days later, it actually did NOT kill the display after shutting off automatically with one tire, so it wasn't just by design, it seems to just be totally intermittent.The ability to set a pressure and let it stop when it hits that pressure is a great concept, but this thing hasn't worked anything nearly as advertised.  I set if for 38 PSI, since my tires max at 44, and the manufacturer suggests 33, but I like a little stiffer wheels than that.  On one tire it shut off about 37.5, on another I had to stop it at 39 myself because it never did shut off.  On the other two it was about 37.5 or so, acceptable.  You can pick in 1 PSI increments above 30, and it reads in 1/2 PSI increments.  But when I tested with a very good tire pressure gauge, the readings this was giving was really around the scale.  The tire that was inflated to 39 PSI before I shut it off myself was actually at 41.  One of the ones that shut off about 37.5, one was actually 35, one was actually 37.Then there's the issue with the rubber inside the valve piece.  The very first tire I put this on and then removed, a piece of the rubber seal inside the nozzle fell to the floor.  It's like it's dry rotted already or something.  And the plastic lever to lock and unlock is not very strong at all, and bends to the point I'm afraid it will snap when I'm putting it on or off.Nothing about this unit screams quality, which would explain the low price.  The concept is good, but the execution failed in many, many ways. I made the mistake of buying this tool to change my rear brake pads on my car thinking that I could get away with getting the cheap tool. I wish I would have just paid a little more for the right tool as this one was such a pain to use.First: There weren't any pin sets that fit my rear brake pistons. There was one side that had 4 house shaped pegs on the corners. I had to grind off two of the pegs and I could use that side. Those house shaped pegs were the only ones that actually fit in my car's pistons.Second: The metal is so soft on this cube thing that when the cube slips out of the slots in the calilper, the metal deforms and becomes rounded off, and it makes it that much harder to use. After it slips off about 10 times, it is almost unusable. I had to frequently go back and use my dremel to remove more material off the pegs to make them flat again on the sides that had rounded off.Third: Eventually those pegs got too small and they would slip out even though they weren't rounded off. I had to switch to another side that had two round pegs out at the corners. However those round pegs were too big, so I had to go back to my dremel to grind them down a bit to fit. Then started the process of slipping and grinding again.Fourth: This cube tool does not compress the piston while turning it. The compression comes from your arm pushing on it, and if you don't push it perfectly straignt, the cube slips. So, you can't put that much force on it. This leads to taking WAY longer to compress the pistons then it should take. With the proper tool that compresses and turns at the same time, these pistons should be able to be compressed in about 5 minutes each. However, with this tool, it took me over two hours to compress ONE piston.Fith: Because of all the grinding I had to do, this tool is now worn out and wouldn't be good to use again on another brake job. So I'm going to have to buy another tool when it comes time to do rear brakes again.There is nothing good about this tool. The only redeeming quality about it is that I was eventually able to get the job done. There were times in the middle where I thought I was going to be running to the auto parts store to buy/rent the proper tool, but it did make it through. It probably would have been quicker to make a trip out and get a new tool though.Do yourself a favor and don't buy this tool. I wouldn't buy any of these cube tools based on my experience with this one. Just spend a little more and get one of the rear brake piston sets that compresses the piston while turning. I wish I had done that, and I will do that for my next brake job (Since this tool is now trash). First, their site gave me the wrong directions.  Took awhile to find the right ones.  This thing once installed has never worked right.  Sometimes it works fine, then randomly stops working all together.  Mute button only works when I hold it down and it cycles on and off... I have to release it and hope it stops on mute.  Volume works for about 4 notches, then won't go back down.  Also, I need to push the buttons really hard to make this thing respond.  Before it was just a light touch.  This thing is irritating and frustrating.  Go with the Axxess ASWC, same price, doesn't need to go though a complicated program process, and actually works! 
Used this to replace the stock intake tube on a 2004 Tahoe 5.3L V8. In conjunction with a K&N panel filter it has added a nice distant intake rumble at higher RPMs without being noticeable while cruising along. There was a small power gain which I noticed at lower RPMs where the transmission would normally downshift it can now pull a little harder from higher gears (overdrive, etc). It also freed up room under the hood which makes accessing the accessory belts easier. Solidly built adapter. Allows me to plug my trailer into the garage when using the lights, charging the batteries or cooling the fridge. A must have for the RVer. I purchased these to increase my light output on my motorcycle.  It is an improvement over the standard 55W low beam that was in there. 
Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.  The pickle fork is the last resort for me, as it will damage the balljoint boot.I prefer to use the Snap On balljoint remover.  If that one cannot fit, then I will try this tool.  If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork. I haven't really used it yet for the reason intended, changing the oil in my jet ski.  So, I can't comment on how well it works.  The main reason for this review is to put it out there that it does not work with a 2000 Chevy Silverado.  The siphon tube does not fit thru the bottom of the dip stick tube.  It would be really nice if Mityvac had a published list of what vehicles it works with and what ones it does not.  I have my fingers crossed that it'll work with my jet ski, otherwise there will be a new/(un)used Mityvac on *****'slist.  Long story short, do your research to see if you can confirm or deny if it will work with your vehicle before you buy it. Below is the formula:1/3: to the manifold (using brake booster)1/3: to the fuel tank1/3: to the engineYour engine will be much cleaner. Remember: do it at night, otherwise, you will scare your neighbor with dark smoke. 
I probably should compare it to another to see how accurate it is, but I really like how easy it is to use and turns off and on by itself. I have it hooked up to the SUV.  This actually works and will kick on every other day or so just to top off the battery.  It does get VERY warm when recharging a low battery so be careful where yo set it down...8-2013 UPDATE. The button to change the type vehicle its attached to starting NOT to work, no matter how hard you pushed on the button. It was returned directly to CTEK and replaced without incident (of course I had to pick up shipping to them).. I don't know why I did not get this sooner but it works very well in filling the fresh water tank in my fifth wheel trailer.. the shut off valve is nice to have at the nozzle so I can easily shut it off the moment I hear that it is full.. 
Considering this is made in China, it is a quality product, too bad all my locks are keyed to the some number these are original manufacturer type wires,  good materials used to make, but quality in testing before shipping is a problem.  when you receive them check the resistance value to make sure they are all  700 ohms or less. The Tender Jr. does not come with a cigarette adapter so I cut this in half to make two. I purchased 2 lighter plugs for a buck each from China&#8230; with free shipping&#8230; and they are working fine. These aren&#8217;t an exact match with the Tender cables but they fit together OK and are easy to determine polarity with the wire colors. You can also just use this as an extension cord for your Tender. The description states a length of 12-inches&#8230; but it&#8217;s actually 14-inches tip-to-tip on the connectors. Nice item for the price and it&#8217;s made in Mexico. 
The sky high ratings intrigued me, so when the Bon-Aire "ultimate" nozzle was available as a Lightning Deal, I bought one to see if it lived up to the hype.The product appears to be very well constructed, and is quite a bit larger and heavier, than your typical cheapo nozzle.  You adjust the flow of water by turning the spray head at the front.  Water flow can be cut off at either end of the range, as the flow pattern goes from off, to a gentle sprinkle, to wide spray, and then narrowing into a beam, and then off again.  Because of the larger sized head, the "ultimate" nozzle has a larger area of coverage, and can deliver a larger volume of water.The nozzle does a decent job of diffusing water flow, producing a nice gentle flowing fountain of water suitable for watering potted plants or delicate flowers.  When adjusted more to a spray, it is well suited for vegetable gardens and general use.  This is however, nothing unique as far as sprinkler nozzles go.Fully open, the front aperture is about 0.12 inches in diameter, which produces a thicker stream of water than your typical cheapo nozzle.  Sometimes a thick stream is advantageous, but you will be using more water, and the increased water pressure may stress your plumbing.  Unless your system has high volume, and good water pressure, you may not be able to take full advantage this nozzle.The nozzle appears to be solidly built, and seems to work as advertised.  Unfortunately the aluminum parts on mine have a reddish finish, rather than green, which looks cooler.  Although it can deliver a higher volume of water, the assertion that it is the "ultimate" is perhaps an overstatement.  It does a good job, but not that much better than the various cheapo nozzles and spray guns.  The economy models typically don't last very long, so if "the ultimate" proves to be durable, it might be worth the premium cost.  It's a bit heavy, and encourages using more water, so at this point I like it more than love it. Used this to replace the stock intake tube on a 2004 Tahoe 5.3L V8. In conjunction with a K&N panel filter it has added a nice distant intake rumble at higher RPMs without being noticeable while cruising along. There was a small power gain which I noticed at lower RPMs where the transmission would normally downshift it can now pull a little harder from higher gears (overdrive, etc). It also freed up room under the hood which makes accessing the accessory belts easier. This is the old stand-by and works very well - you can always turn so you can see the dial.  It doesn't always sit well on the stems for some reason, but using this with an air compressor is so much faster than a small 12-volt compressor and hand gauge. 
Tired of being charged WAY to much pretty much everywhere for a 5 min filter change? I got this for my 2008 prius and you can do the install yourself in under 5 min for almost nothing. Never pay $120 again at the dealer.Your CAF is located behind the glovebox. To get to it, you need to open your glovebox and let it sit open all the way. Empty out your glovebox. If you don't, you'll be cleaning up the contents of your glovebox from the floor when you're done replacing your CAF. Next step is to look on the right side and unhook the dampener. Next, squeeze the rear of the glovebox sides inwards to be able to let the glovebox swing all the way down.Looking inside, you'll see a tray with latches on both sides. Press those latches inwards and start sliding the tray out.When you put your new CAF into the tray, make sure you follow the arrow on the filter as the air is meant to flow through in one direction. The air flow is down. If you forget, the tray has an arrow on it also that says &#34;air flow&#34;.To finish the job, reverse the proceedures above. Slide the tray in, click into place, rotate the glovebox up and let it snap into place, replace the dampener bar, then close the glovebox. I highly recommend these mirrors. I did a lot of looking and comparing before I bought these. I have a 2006 Toyota Tacoma and these things fit well and do a real nice job. They vibrate a little but not excessive. The little bit of vibration I see doesn't interfere with my view. I also do not extend them very far. The further out you go with them the more they will vibrate. Just extend to the minimum needed in order to be able to see.Before attaching to the vehicle I think it's a good idea to loosen the three screws holding the swivel in place on the bottom of the mirrors and work in a drop of oil. Then do not over tighten these screws. They don't have to be very tight to hold the mirror still and not over tightening allows easy adjustment later. If you find they move when you close the door you can tighten a little more but to start off, finger tight with the screwdriver is all you need. I also placed a couple drops of oil on the aluminum sliding bar and worked it in before attaching. Also, when you bolt the mirror onto the aluminum slide bar, grip the base (the part with the internal threads) with a vise-grip or something (not too tight to crush it), then make sure the lock nut is between the bolt and the bar on the bottom, and then screw the bolt into the base (and through the aluminum slide bar) nice and tight without letting the base turn. You'll notice there are &#34;teeth&#34; on the bottom of the base. These are supposed to sink into the bar as you tighten the bolt. They keep the base from turning when you adjust the mirror. This is another good reason to not overtighten the three screws around the swivel. You want to be able to adjust the mirror from side to side and have it turn only at the swivel and without causing the base to turn against the aluminum slide bar.The bracket will bend the weather stripping on the outside of the window a little. It springs back when the mirror is removed but some of it will be permanent. It's not a big deal and you'll just have to deal with this if you want to use these mirrors. It is not a detriment to the operation of the window.I installed them as far forward as possible so that the top of the bracket was parallel to the ground and the new mirror sits right beside my existing one towards the outside. Tightening the ratchet by hand produced plenty of tension to hold it securely. Releasing the ratchet is another matter. It's too tight to just push it down with your finger. To release the tension I use a short piece of rope and loop it under the sliding buckle. Then I stand right next to the truck with the rope looped around one hand and my other hand on the ratchet release tab. I use my body leverage (knees and back) to pull upward on the rope a little which takes just enough pressure off the belt to allow me to press the ratchet release tab. You don't need to back the ratchet off very far - just enough to get the hook out from under the door. Then just close up the bracket and wrap up the belt around it and you're all pre-set for the next time.For better stability I advise when you're adjusting the belt, place the sliding buckle as necessary so that the crossbar forming the angle is not extended very far, if at all. And, yes, make sure there isn't any dirt behind the buckle or you'll get a scuff mark.You should have the windows all the way down when attaching to the vehicle. The bracket comes close to the window so you need to be careful not to let it scratch the window. After you get the mirror on I advise to raise the window very slowly to make sure that the metal bracket is not contacting (scratching) the window as you raise it. Once you're under way - be sure not to lower the window if there is any sand or debris laying on the bracket right next to the window or a scratch may occur from this action also. I've taken these off and on several times now and we've travelled with them and I've been relatively careful and have never had one scratch my window.On my truck, the doors fit really well and I can tell the difference when the hook for the mirror strap is hooked under the door. The door fits just a tad more tightly than usual. It has to be closed just a slight bit harder to make the latch engage and when I open the door it pops out ever so slightly because of the extra tension produced by the hook being in there on the bottom. I don't see this as a problem. The mirrors are not on there all the time and, even if they were, I think the latch mechanism on the Toyota is stout enough to handle it without any long term problems developing. Just be aware that the hook will slightly change thge way the door latches.The instructions are good, too. Not the usual loosely translated Mandarin. I've tried to supplement here with my own experience. The pair of levels are a great value.  I recently purchased these for a second time, as the originals were sold with my previous trailer and I wanted to make my new trailer easier to get on a level stance.There really isn't much to go wrong as far as product failure is concerned.  Accuracy is up to you with the initial installation.Recommended method of installation is to get your trailer level/RV, front to back, and side to side.  Once you have your trailer true, install the graduated levels in locations which will show you front to back level (placed on the side of the trailer) and side to side (place on the front or back of the trailer).  Make sure the bubble indicates "level" by being in the center point of the tube.Installation should be done once all your components are "stressed" as they will be for trailer/RV use (I.E. front tongue on a travel trailer, all the normal weight sitting on the winch foot, or in the case of 5th wheels/motorcoaches, landing gear down), try to place the levels on the RV in clear view of the winch/landing gear controls to enable leveling without having to relocate to a different location to view the levels.I accomplished this on a travel trailer by placing one level on the very front center, and the other on the side of the frame tongue close to the winch.  Though small, with sharp eye-sight, you can take advantage of the one on the front of the trailer as you position the trailer to see if you can establish a level side to side stance as you near your desired location.On my 5th wheel, my landing gear controls are on the front corner of the main body.  I placed one on the side of the rig for front to back level, and another right around the corner on the front side (for side to side level) still within sight of the controls, as well as from the truck cab for backing up.  Even though the level is off center, if it is installed properly with the trailer level at the time of installation, it will work fine.As far as the graduated scales are concerned, you will have to find your "scale" for adjustments, as it depends on where the levels are placed in reference to the center of the pivot points.The levels come with a self adhesive foam strip on the back for placement as well as two holes for screws if you wish to drill holes in the side of your rig.  I go with the adhesive strip route, as I don't like unnecessary holes.  The only negative with the adhesive strips is they will flex if stressed and it can put the levels off level, though this only happened to me with the first pair after the foam tape aged a few years.One last comment . . .the green bubble tube will fade from extended UV exposure.  It will not interfere with the accuracy, just makes it a little harder to read.If you are looking for larger levels which can be read from a distance, I know they are out there, but I have no experience with them to make a comparison.  I do not wish to clutter the appearance of the rig with large levels. 
I have been using a jointless wiper blade ever since it became a popular replacement for the factory jointed type that is usually pre-installed when you buy a new vehicle. The ANCO C-19-UB Contour Wiper Blade - 19" fits the bill when you need to replace or just want to upgrade to a better performing wiper blade. Got this just in time to coincide with persistent rainy weather we've been having in my state. Snow on the other hand is a different story, no way for me to simulate that kind of weather event. It also worked well with frost accumulation on the windshield. It wiped away the frost smoothly, with no kind of hesitation or drag while in the wiping motion.My thoughts:Performance: the jointless type ANCO C-19-UB Contour Wiper Blade - 19" is contoured better to "hug" your windshield with minimal resistance and pressure points. This translates to better wiping ability thereby enabling you to see better in inclement weather. Since it is jointless, this type of wiper gives you uniform wiping pressure, eliminating the pressure points or the "streaks" that you see across your windshield as it moves across the windshield. The curvature of this wiper is aerodynamic, it will prevent a lift-off of the blade even in high winds.Installation: it took less than 10 minutes to install the ANCO C-19-UB Contour Wiper Blade - 19" without using any of the adapters for the wiper arm of my vehicle.Very satisfied with how the ANCO C-19-UB Contour Wiper Blade - 19" has performed. It is in the middle of the pack as far as price is concerned compared to other jointless name-brand wiper but gives you an awesome wiping performance. Highly recommended! This Contour wiper blade is an upgrade for a beam blade or the older conventional wiper blade. My car has the conventional wiper blade. The contour blade was a breeze to install. I just removed my old blade, added the attachment to the contour blade and plugged it into the wiper arm. Took about 2 minutes.Once on, the new wiper worked great. There was no smudging at all, the blade wiped the window perfectly clean on each pass. I'll definitely replace my old blades with this type when it comes to replace them. In my area we have a high degree of temperature change and seasonal weather.  Heavy ice under snow is not uncommon in the winter and cold damp nights with high daytime temps during the summer months is the norm.  Windshield wipers take a real beating to say the least. We have two trucks, an F-250 Ford diesel and an F-150 Ford. With hauling our horses and other farm related work, the dust, weather and miles are a test for any wiper blade... the ANCO Contour blades pass that test.  I replaced one of the 22 inch blades on the F-250 and one of the 20 inch blades on the F-150. The "Kwik Connect" installation was easy.  They form a tight fit against the windshield that doesn't faulter with highway speeds.  On the other side of the vehicles I used a $30.00 premium wiper blade.  The ANCO blade has proven itself to be superior in all areas. I highly recommend the ANCO Contour wiper blade and believe it to be one of the best blades on the market. 
Great tool for clamping hard to reach radiator hose clamps.  Its multi-position locking mechanism will make sure to clamp and hold various sized clamps- unlike other pliers that can only hold in the fully close position. This clip holds my EZ-pass perfectly and it is easy to switch vehicles if I want (unlike the Velcro strips).  Once placed on the windshield on clean glass it stays in position.  My car has been really hot in the summer and the suction cups have held.  Putting the clip behind the rearview mirror keeps it hidden and I don't even notice it when driving. Easy to mount and adjust. Since each one is made identical (there is no right or left, you just mount the mirror differently), one has the tensioner lever right next to the mirror (drivers side in my case). That is not a problem if you place it back from your mirror. Good sturdy mount and no vibration. Once adjusted they are easy on and off. 
I am not a good mechanic, I don't even pretend to play one on TV. Mostly I am somebody who is sick of paying $80 to the local mechanic to find out the gas cap is cracked or some $10 part needs to be replaced. I finally decided to buy a code scanner to facilitate my repair efforts.---THE GOOD STUFF---* The unit worked right out of the box on both my 2006 Subaru Outback and my 2002 Jeep GC. The hardest part of the whole deal was finding the port on the Subaru. (Tip-look under the hood release).* There seems to be a whole INNOVA website that they want you to go to for help translating the numeric codes into English. So far typing every code I have seen into Google has brought back more information than I know how to use. Not sure how this works for more serious mechanics who might need access to technical bulletins, but for us Saturday morning driveway hackers, it is fine.* The unit seems reasonably well made, although not sure it would stand up to the day-to-day use of a professional. For us "couple times a year" mechanics, it seems fine.---THE NOT SO GOOD STUFF---* There are no directions included, only a CDROM. The CD doesn't even have the directions, but points you to a website. Actually it doesn't even do that, instead it loads an application onto your computer and the app has a link built into it to get you to the website. Kind of convoluted and time wasting.* Plugging the scanner into your USB port kicks off the loading of a driver. No warning, and no idea what it loaded. I hate that.* The box could really do with a quick-start guide. Really all you need to know is how to plug it in, when to power (not start) the vehicle, and what the little buttons do. Would fit on an index card. Instead it is a 15 minute software deal.---SUMMARY---It seems fine for what I want it to do, namely just scan codes quickly. The whole PC/CDROM could have just as soon been skipped. For my use, no reason at all to plug it into the computer, and the installed app just looks like trouble.Ideally a quick-start guide, or better yet, some abbreviated instructions printed on the back, would have made this so much easier for a first time scanner user. That is the reason for the 4 stars and not 5.No idea how robust the unit is, or how long it will last, but I will probably lose it or drop it before it "wears out". So the little LCD panel on this thing displays certain..."things" that make no sense to a normal human being.  Sure, you could click through them and select whatever it is they mean, but you'd really have no idea what you were testing.  So as far as the user interface and user experience goes, this thing is below the bar...as far as computing, but automotive items still have a ways to catch up.Luckily, the manual says what to press, which string of letters you'll see, what they mean, and what to do.  Without the manual, this thing is kind of useless.  As long as you keep the manual handy, however, you have yourself a pretty nice electric system tester.  Testing a variety of batteries - and charging systems (you know, the same kind of thing that automotive and repair shops have...connect to the battery, start the car, turn on all the power equipment...and they tell you that you need a new battery and/or alternator.)  Well, now you can do that on your own time and not have to trust somebody that's trying to sell you a battery and alternator!Overall, this thing was fairly easy to use with the manual by my side.  While I can't guarantee its accuracy, both cars I tested and a tractor battery all tested to be in good shape, which I believe since I've never had a problem with any of them.  The LCD readout is easy to read even in sunlight...though it is kind of an odd color.  If you mix orange and hot pink...that's the color.Good little tool to have...would recommend.  Just be very sure not to toss the instructions. The product does exactly as described. When first "UNLOCKING" the lock be sure to pull the gray part (fits into the latch of hitch) DOWN. Trying to lift the crome part does not work. It is very frustrating trying to unlock something that is not suppose to be done incorrectly and makes one feel rather embarassed after wife watches and then laughs when you finally figure it out.Realistically thought the lock does serve its purpose, easy to use and qood quality for the price from Amazon.. 
Nice high amp (current) rating on this. I epoxy it to a 12ah  12 volt gel battery and I can use it as a jumpstarter oremergency power supply for camping or power outages. I was using this to power my Viair 00073 70P Heavy Duty Portable Compressor but with 6amp it doenst do the Job, returned it and went with Schumacher 1216 12V 15 Amp Power Converter, good to go! After a power outage, I connected my refrigerator to this power supply. Sadly, its inverter was unable to support my refrigerator. The Duracell DPP-600HD doesn't have enough momentary  output to handle the initial start-up current spike of a refrigerator's compressor motor. The specifications say it can momentarily provide up to 960 watts. This equates to 8 amps at 120v.  Yet, public benchmark figures for a home refrigerator's start-up current indicate 13 amps for up to 1/2 second. Other appliances that use electric motors such as sump pumps are likely to exhibit the same characteristics. My suggestion is that customers immediately test this product with any device they intend to power during an outage.Some important specifications are missing in the Amazon listing.  One of the key statics is the capacity of the internal battery, which is 28 amp-hours at 12 v.  This equates to 336 watt hours.  Yet, AC output is much lower than this presumably due to inverter losses.  These losses increase with power output.  The following table illustrates this.  The last column is my calculation.load.................watts....hours....watt-hoursCordless telephone.....5........35.0 ...175Portable stereo.........10........22.0 ...220Laptop computer.......20........7.0 ....140Fan.......................100.........1.7....17036" TV...................133........1.2 ....1603/8 drill.................300........0.4 ....115Warm-air fan heater.312........0.4 ....109Blender..................385........0.3 ....109HID Floodlights.......400........0.3.....107Observe that the total energy delivered (watt-hour) drops with power consumption.  Ultimately, the usable energy is significantly less than what is contained within the lead acid battery.For reference, a refrigerator will use about 200 watts of electricity when the compressor is running. Typical consumers will have their refrigerator running about 50% to 60% of the time, which equates to an average of 100-120 watts being consumed continuously.ConsDoesn't handle current spikes associated with certain electric motorsProsBoth AC and DC outputPortableSimple operation 
Disclosure: I am not basing my review on first hand experience but the way it is I could trust that this guy works. When car is upside down, this keychain would stay in place in the ignition ring and you could quickly find it and pull it. Breaks glass with 1-2 tries but not wind shield. Practice in the junkyard and you'll see and the quickest way to cut the seatbelt. 3M knows how to make sandpaper. When you get to 2000 grit you're really polishing. I use this prior to polishing something. Works perfectly on a 1997 Honda Prelude. Replaced the rotor as the same time as the distributor cap and wires and plugs. Might as well since you are in there and it is so cheap.The trick to getting it off is that the one screw that holds it in, is only accessible when the engine cylinders are in a specific location. I found it easiest to disconnect all the spark plugs so it wouldn't actually start then crank the car momentarily. After you crank go and check if the screw is there. If not, crank again, check again. Took me about 8 tries, but it is really random. The precise way of doing it is to turn it by hand or to put in gear and roll it slowly, but I found it much easier to just crank and try. 
I have some fog lights that I use on the back of my truck to light up the sides of my 5th wheel when I am pulling in to a camping spot at night. I got these so I can easly connect and disconnect these lights. They make it very easy to connect/disconnect anything you have that just needs power and ground. I installed this on my Audi I keep at a vacation house that only gets driven once a month.  It comes with two battery mounts - clips and a permanant set.  The permanant set installed quickly and easily on the battery - and there is a heavy duty plug witht a cover that I just tuck into the battery holder.  It all looks very clean and "factory installed".  When I leave town I just open the hood an inch - pull out the plug - and plug into the wall unit.  A red light indicates it is charging - green light means it is full.  All very simply and easy to use - and I never have the hassle of jumping the car or having to use another trickle charger. Almost too bright, but I love it.  Maybe the 100 watt model would be better than these 130's if your eyes are sensitive to bright lights.  Exactly what my 2004 Dodge Ram needed because the factory headlights stink.  My brights were no brighter than my low beam, and my old 1985 Nissan had brighter brights, but these KC 130 watt driving lights solved that problem perfectly.  For not being the full, long range lights KC offers, they sure shine pretty far, plus spread the light out to the sides and up into the trees, a good long range / flood combination.  I mounted them to my push/brush guard.  Took about 3 hours to install because I like to route, hide, and secure the wires very well.  I connected the white switch / relay hot wire to my high beam (brights)wire on the drivers side, so they go on and off with my high / low switch, plus I have the master switch mounted (without the switch frame) near the dash to keep the KC lights off completely if I want.  Just make sure you dim your lights (turn off the KC's) before you see anyone ahead of you or you'll blind them and can get a ticket if on a public road.  First night I tried them a big 8 point ran across the road in front of me, then stopped and pretty much "tip toed" off the road as if he was totally blind and afraid to move.  So beware of animals freezing in front of you with these things.  I turned them off and honked so he could run away.  And no, I don't hunt that way.The wiring diagram on the outside of the box did not show the white power / relay wire, as if it was pre-wired into the main power wire, but luckily there was the white power / relay wire available to tap into my high beam wire.  The wiring diagram on the directions in the box was correct.  Some vehicles newer than 1999 may not allow tapping into the high beam wire because of the vehicle's computer that senses voltage changes, but it worked on mine.  Only thing I had to supply was a sheet metal screw to secure the relay.  I cut off about 5 feet of extra wire that went to the switch.  The length of wire to the lights was just right. 
Very good product.  Now my wife can pull into the garage without backing up and maneuvering her car to get it right.  Easy to install.  As a point of reference for her, I put a small &#34;cupboard door&#34; disc on the dash.  When we pull the car in all she needs to do is get the light to be within an inch of the &#34;cupboard door&#34; disc on the dash 360 degrees and the car is parked perfect.  Our garage is a 3 car one, but with my car, motor cycle, large mower, tools, tool chest, garbage cans, lawn equipment, wall cabinets,  etc....we need to make sure we manage the space.  And now we have more space. Simple! You must do accurate measurements so you don't damage walls or doors in tight and close spaces. Put the vehicle in the parking spot, line up the parking mats next to the tires, mark the PRECISE location of each mat in relation to the tires, back out the vehicle, slide the mats into former tire location, DONE! Now, roll the vehicle back into place. SIMPLE! This item works very well. It has a really bright L.E.D light and setup is super easy. I think some folks recieved a knock off and therefore you might need to varify items part number and maybe even UPC number before ordering anywere online. Make sure it says MAXSA on the package and you have the correct one.It is very easy to setup,I measured our car first. Our Infiniti from dash center {were I wanted laser} to the front bumper was about 6ft. I then measured in my garage were I wanted the cars dash to be when I parked witch came out to be approx 9-10 ft from front wall. Thats 6 FT + 3 to 4FT for mower and walking space in front of car.Mine ended up being located in front of my garage door opener so my cars about 3-4 feet in my garage door when it detects it. That way it will light up just before I get to parking location I chose and laser wont stop shining before I park like some reported.My door opener dont seem to interfere with sensor even though its located between door and laser. Its a good sensor IMO. I aimed the laser on the center of my dash using a long stick while car was parked and the way I have it as long as the light is on the dash area rather all the way forward,centered or on the the edge of the dash the cars clear and your parking is fine.Since my laser is just above the center of the dash area and points straight down on the dash area, it leaves about a foot in either direction front or rear for some error. It seems to work well like this. It took about 15 min total to setup.CAUTION: Wives/husbands may act like they dont need a garage laser and it was a stupid waste of money. Even when they choose to drive your truck to work everyday because they dont want to pull thier car in/out of the garage before this was installed. This will pass soon as long as you "never" mention it was for them again. NEVER MENTION IT AGAIN!!!! 
I did a bit of research before purchasing this product. If you want a quick charge, I have read that your battery won't last as long. For battery life, the ideal charge is low amerage.  I appreciate that this charger provides a low amp charge to the battery. I had an older battery charger that I believe prematurely destroyed one of my 12v batteries, so I did my best to find the best value replacement. As a matter of fact, the way I saw the older charger behaving (according to my digital multimeter), I was concerned that it could cause the battery to explode or start a fire. I decided to get a new one. I looked at all of the battery chargers I could find on Amazon and other sites. Eventually, I settled on this particular model for these reasons:1. Provides a low amperage charge, which is supposed to help prolong battery life.2. Desulphination mode, which is supposed to help prolong battery life.3. Safety shutoff features, so that it doesn't overcharge the battery.4. Reads the battery polarity and illuminates a red light if you have it reversed.5. Excellent review on Amazon and other sites that sell battery chargers.I've only been using the battery minder for a couple of months, but I think it is working well. The recharges and maintenance modes seem appropriate. The batteries seem to last a long time after I charge them. This product seems to be living up to the claims and ratings. I am impressed. I own several vehicles and motorcycles and I had one of the pre china battery tenders and it lasted for several years. it did so well I bought 3 more of the battery tender pluses at one time at Christmas 2010.one worked for about 9 months and then would not go into the float mode. It killed the battery from overcharging. hooked up the next on a different battery and it worked about 2 weeks before doing the same thing(not going into float mode).  the 3rd one lasted less than a week........... each has a 10 year warranty so I phoned deltran and spoke to their "tech". he cannot understand my problem........ tried on different batteries. plugged into outlet first blah ,blah ,blah. I paid over $100.00 for 3 of these Chinese junk chargers.I can send them back and they will check at my cost if nothing is found wrong I would be charged a service fee and return shipping. poor customer service ,bad quality. for what these cost they should last.Do yourself a favor and do NOT buy these battery tender chargers........Update: 1-15-2014 buy an xtreme charger......I have 3 of the red xtreme charger, see my review ........ The SOLAR BA7 is an excellent addition to a solar energy system maintenance kit. The storm season just started and after having to endure a few bad storms last year, and the aftermath of many days without electricity; this year I'm ready. The first thing I did was to be sure the AGM batteries in my solar energy system are in good shape and for that I used the SOLAR BA7 to test them.The included user's manual indicates how to perform the test depending of the type of battery one is testing, and the SOLAR BA7 support testing for many types of battery and ratings. A good investment without a doubt, because one never knows when the unexpected necessity to test a battery might come. 
I have it hooked up to the SUV.  This actually works and will kick on every other day or so just to top off the battery.  It does get VERY warm when recharging a low battery so be careful where yo set it down...8-2013 UPDATE. The button to change the type vehicle its attached to starting NOT to work, no matter how hard you pushed on the button. It was returned directly to CTEK and replaced without incident (of course I had to pick up shipping to them).. I recently rec'd this unit, charged for a full 20hrs.Just used it to jump start my 2005 G35 coupe, it worked perfectly as I used it twice, checked the status light, appeared to be be able to jump a few more V6 engines before I need to recharge unit.Also, my battery was totally dead, I mean when I turned the key...no lights on the dash, no clicking sounds from the engine...totally drained battery.I might consider buying another unit for my other carEdit: March 26 2013I tried to help my friend who had a 2008 Subaru Legacy 4 cylinder turbo, it failed to start it as he drained his battery when he forgot to turn off the interior map light. I was surprised it failed since it started my V6 G35 which also had a near dead battery. I hope my unit was not good for just one jump??Also, note that I recharge my jump starter after every single use.Reducing rating from 5 STARS to just 3 stars I bought this battery for a lantern at my mountain cabin I need to keep charged when the power goes out.  I charged it to a full charge and tested the lantern and it will stay lite for over (8) hours which is longer than the original battery.  You just have to remember only to charge the battery until the green light comes and then unplug it. 
I did not carefully read reviews before placed my order.  Few buyer pointed out the product feature has changed.  According ad photo, It suppose has green and red indicator lights but only comes with one single red light, green light feature is omitted.  Red light means AC power is on but no way to tell it is actually charging or not?  For only one red light version, you can pay less than half price from other seller for similar product at Amazon. This is a no-brainer product - it just works - no instructions or complexity needed!  I have a quick connect dongle attached to the terminals on my battery, so in less than 2 minutes I had this product out of it's box and plugged into my motorcycle.  A red light came on to let me know it was charging - and a green light alerted me when it was finished.  A++ If the charging system is completely dead and the engine is running on battery voltage only, this monitor will display green (as in everything is okay) as it it goes into battery check mode.  While the low display voltage will tell you something is definitely wrong with the charging system, the green light can be a little misleading. 
I required an ammonia-free window cleaner for my tinted windows. This does the job quite nicely. It isn't how well it does, rather how safely it does it. If your working with spark plugs you need this. As standard as they come and guaranteed to work.  Helped me gap my plugs with no problems. If you don't know how to use, just youtube it. I was suprised how well and how easy they worked even on an extended van.  It saves wear and tear on the shoulders. 
This item works very well. It has a really bright L.E.D light and setup is super easy. I think some folks recieved a knock off and therefore you might need to varify items part number and maybe even UPC number before ordering anywere online. Make sure it says MAXSA on the package and you have the correct one.It is very easy to setup,I measured our car first. Our Infiniti from dash center {were I wanted laser} to the front bumper was about 6ft. I then measured in my garage were I wanted the cars dash to be when I parked witch came out to be approx 9-10 ft from front wall. Thats 6 FT + 3 to 4FT for mower and walking space in front of car.Mine ended up being located in front of my garage door opener so my cars about 3-4 feet in my garage door when it detects it. That way it will light up just before I get to parking location I chose and laser wont stop shining before I park like some reported.My door opener dont seem to interfere with sensor even though its located between door and laser. Its a good sensor IMO. I aimed the laser on the center of my dash using a long stick while car was parked and the way I have it as long as the light is on the dash area rather all the way forward,centered or on the the edge of the dash the cars clear and your parking is fine.Since my laser is just above the center of the dash area and points straight down on the dash area, it leaves about a foot in either direction front or rear for some error. It seems to work well like this. It took about 15 min total to setup.CAUTION: Wives/husbands may act like they dont need a garage laser and it was a stupid waste of money. Even when they choose to drive your truck to work everyday because they dont want to pull thier car in/out of the garage before this was installed. This will pass soon as long as you "never" mention it was for them again. NEVER MENTION IT AGAIN!!!! I receive the unit with a black power adapter not white color like the picture show. But no big deal!It comes with all mounting screws and 2 stripes of foam double side tapes. I will not use these tapes, these are some cheap foam type. I don't think it will hold for long. I use black 3M heavy duty exterior double side tape for mounting. I did not use screws because I mount the laser unit underneath the garage door opener. for ceiling mount screw is still the best! I use heat gun to warm up the these tape for mounting, it works like a glue!This unit comes with a mounting bracket, first you have to mount the bracket than hook the laser unit onto the bracket. however the laser unit is not secure on the bracket. It can come loose very easy! which mean it can fall onto your car. So, I add an electric tape at the back of the unit, now the unit stays!The red laser is bright and clear, it can be see clearly in day light. the laser will turns on and stay on about 2 to 3 minutes.9V battery for power outage backup is also a great feature!Great buy! I bought this, set the code by turning the screw inside the front of the unit, and sprayed with a silicone lubricant.After a month on the front bumper, in the WA rain, there's no sign of rust and the inside tray is dry.The thumb-wheels turn easily and front face plate is tight.I can't find fault with this and it seems pretty secure.Since I can't predict when and where I might lock myself out of the truck, I just leave this on the front receiver by CURT where it fit's just fine with the smallest gasket.I'm very happy with this purchase. 
Does the job for which it was intended. Added to HOT water and dissolved, pour it into the base of the Air-O-Swiss humidifier to clean any 'scaling' and other 'old water' contaminants. Then thoroughly rinse (without dunking the base under water) and do this about every 2 months. Great way to protect your gauge - A MUST HAVE EXTRASome reviewers have commented on this being difficult to fit.The leaflet recommends use of silicon spray, however even easier with hot water.1- Bowl of HOT (not boiling but HOT), leave the cover sitting in the hot water for a good 5 minutes.2- Rub a few splashes of water around the gauge.3- Take the boot out of the water (keep it hot and wet).4- It will then slip straight on, just wipe off the water and then let it dry.JOB DONE !Just remember to use some thread tape or sealer when re-fitting the hose. This dries my car very well and stops water spots from forming. 
It does exactly what it's supposed to do. No problems whatsoever. Does what it says it does......looks great ! I did not carefully read reviews before placed my order.  Few buyer pointed out the product feature has changed.  According ad photo, It suppose has green and red indicator lights but only comes with one single red light, green light feature is omitted.  Red light means AC power is on but no way to tell it is actually charging or not?  For only one red light version, you can pay less than half price from other seller for similar product at Amazon. 
Bought 2 of them from Amazon, came quickly and you can leave them plugged in continuously to monitor your battery and charging system. This is the best thing for keeping your battery up when being stored.Once your batery is up to a full charge, it practicaly uses no power. It only kicks on when the voltage falls below a usable charge. It has a plug in adapter that you can fasten on to the battery permanately and just plug it into the charger when needed. PROS:Indicator light while charging. Shows when charging is complete.AC power cable.Easy to get inexpensive terminal adapters so you can leave them on your vehicle and trickle charge as necessary. 
Does the job it says it does.  I connected the quick-connect to my battery in my 2004 Honda Civic LX.  I poked the quick-connect through my hood so I don't have to raise my hood every time I want to change the battery.  I pull in the garage (after driving) and connect the battery charger with the quick-connect.  I let it charge all the time.  I rarely drive; so it helps keep the battery charged. I have used this charger many times to charge the battery in a car that sits outside and I rarely drive. The voltage and percent charge display is very nice.  Very easy to use I am very pleased with this battery maintainer.  I purchased the cigarette light plug along with this unit and it is so easy to use.  I plugged it in, set it to normal charge and brought a totally discharged battery back to life.  The battery is holding the charge just fine and I couldn't be happier.  I especially like the &#34;supply&#34; mode on this unit so I can change out a battery without losing the codes on my car.  No one should be without this charger.  I have a car that sits in the garage and used sparingly and this device keeps the battery fully charged. 
it works well, it's well made, but make sure you realize it has a built in timer. If you camp in your van at night and have a spare battery that you use for things like this and expect you to keep you warm all night you'll wake up an hour later freezing. There is another blanket out there that doesn't have a timer for that purpose. But I keep this one in my boat for rides on chilly days when my mom gets cold. And here the timer is perfect so it doesn't accidentally get left on. I use this through the season on a couple pieces of power equipment that doesn't get used often and also during winter when I store my batteries indoors (cold climate). Works good and only draws 12 watts while plugged in. I purchased this to charge a pair of very large AGM deep cell batteries I have hooked in series.  It took them from near zero to full charge in a bit over 4 hours, topping them off slowly and then automatically shut down... perfect. It's light, easy to use, the cables, clamps and case are robust and should take a lot of use without failure.One other thing of note, if you plug it into a small gas generator, on 4 amp charge it won't even bring the generator off idle. This allows you to charge batteries, and also run household items off the generator at the same time. Perfect for cabin or RV solar systems on rainy cloudy days when the solar panels won't provide enough and no "plug" is available. 
INNOVA 3030 Diagnostic Code Reader for OBDII Vehiclesi purchased this product last month and i don't know why. it reads your on-board computer alright. but if you want a detail report of a problem you might be having with your check engine light on, they charge you a fee for a complete detail report.AUTOZONE,ADVANCEAUTO AND CARQUEST will test your vehicle free of charge and will provide you with a detail report for free.the fleecing of america continues by online companies.AMAZON, SHAME OF YOU !!!!!!!! Amazon really needs to check some of their cross reference charts. This does not it a 2011 Kia LX Sorento. This product appears to include the cable. IT DOESN'T. It's just the mount which it does okay, but you'll have to buy the cable separately. 
We have cars with full of electronic gadgets so they consume significant electricity, even when car is being driven. Almost every week we get no start due to weak battery. I have an external car battery charger (old). It is bulky to setup to charge cars overnight. Also it does not have any detection, so the battery can be continuously overcharged, which will eventually damage the battery (as multiple battery experts tell me). Never learned our lesson as we had 3 quality batteries purchased and replaced - each within 2 years.After reading all the great reviews, I bought one of these on-board charger and installed in one of the car that frequently dies (even with new battery). Now I can just plug in to the wall when car is parked each night, and unplug in the morning before the commute. No need to check if charging is complete if not driven for days! Also it will reduce the risk of not able to start the car to almost none.I will be buying another one for our other electronic gadgets-heavy car...  The next convenient thing is to find a good retractable power cords that can either be installed in the car with the on-board charger, or to the outlets for which the charger will be tapping power from. I have aWagan Power Dome EX 400-Watt Jump Starter with Built-In Air Compressorthat is a permanent tool in one of our family car. That unit's quality was highly questionable. Finally on the third replacement I had a good one. It had the features I wanted: compressor (for kids bikes, balls), inverter, USB power, and jumper. It was a worthy compromise of battery power and features.But I want a second unit, with focus on a battery that can power my electronics longer and jump a car. This model seems to allow longest running of electronics out of all battery-based units with inverter/jumper.When this unit arrive, I expected to charge for 48 hours per instruction. But seems like the unit was already fully charged before shipping out. Within minutes, the charging status showed solid green and battery status reported 100%. That's nice when they can charge it (Amazon warehouse?) before shipping it out.First test powering my more power-hungry laptops (80 watts), LCD monitors, portable fans, etc. I'm happy to report the expected duration is quite accurate. For example, one of my appliance that averages 75 watt runs for about 2 hours and 20 minutes. 100 watt electronics ran for 2 hours.*SIDE NOTE* One of my favorite thing is to power my PS3 console in this marvelous gaming case:GAEMS Halo UNSC Vanguard Personal Gaming Environment (Xbox NOT Included)As for starting a car with dead battery, I had the opportunity to tested just 2 days after receiving it. I had left my car's lights on in the morning, and by start of evening the battery was not strong enough to start the car. After connecting the jumpers, the first two cranks resulted in no go. After waited for 5 minutes, I started the car again and the car started without any hesitation.What this means to me that the rated crank amp of 350CA is not strong enough to jump start most cars with a "dead" battery. (I think AAA guy once told me average cars need 600 - 700 crank amps).  Even my Wagan 400 watt inverter (with 600 crank amps) couldn't get car started on first try many times.  If it cannot start immediately, don't panic! Wait a few minutes!  A car battery is technically dead at 12V, and fully charged at 12.6 - 12.8V. So by letting the powerpack to charge the car battery for 5 - minutes, it frequently is enough to raise the voltage close to 12.6 to start the car.Anyway, it's a good start for me on this battery. But time will tell if the battery can retain charge to be useful for at least two years. Will update here in a few months. Very easy to work with.  I reconditioned my emergency battery that was beginning to get weaker.  I also reconditioned my auto battery on my 15 year old car (the battery is about 5 years old).When using is I recommend you plug it into a powerstrip that has a on/off switch.  You need to connect the unit to the battery and to avoid sparks it help to make the connection with the power switch off, then turn it on when everything is set. 
I see a lot of negative reviews for this charger that I think are partially due to Amazon's incorrect description and the fact that most people don't know what size or type of charger they need. (including myself)I am a practicing Electronic engineer with more than 20yrs experience. I did not know much about battery chargers until recently researching what a good battery charger should do.1) this charger only delivers a max of 1.5A. This means if you try to charge a discharged auto battery (48AH) it will take a long long time. This charger does work great for topping off a car battery at 70% (12.4V).2) The instructions included clearly state the charger will automatically shut-off after 12 hours of charging. The charger will restart and continue charging if you unplug and then plug the charger in again. Best to get a higher capacity charger.3) This charger does have a float mode sort of. Actually it shuts off the charging current and monitors battery voltage. When the battery voltage drops low enough the charger cycles on to top it off and then shuts off again.MY SUMMARY 1st:I like this charger and think it does a good job for the PRICE. Gold box special was $15.20 + tax. (I would definitely buy it at the regular price for $3$)It's basically automatic. Don't have to set the voltage and it won't damage anything if you reverse the clips accidently. Compact size and reasonable quality clamps.This charger does what it is designed for. That is charge small batteries and top off larger automotive batteries. This is an excellent maintenance charger for all batteries to keep them fully charged when not in use. (My opinion)Personally I would not leave any charger connected to my battery for more than 24 hours. Now I use a cheap mechanical timer that is set to turn on for 1 hour every 24 hours. I would prefer a timer that I can set to turn on twice a week for a few hours.The charger is small feels solidly built with heavy plastic. It gets very warm aftercharging at 1.5A but not warm enough to be concerned. (no cooling fan)I gave this charger 5 stars because PRICE and performance is very good. Build quality is good as well.AMAZON DESCRIPTION (Poor): is incorrect in that this charger is not intended to be used to charge a LOW (discharged) car battery. The chart in the DESCRIPTION that shows the charging times is different than the manual.. The included MANUAL has a chart that states this charger should only be used as a "top off" or maintenance charger for auto batteries. In addition the charger in charging mode automatically shuts off after 12 hours of charging. (A good safety feature in my opinion.)Charging details:I discharged a car/truck jump start battery pack to 12.45V or approx 75% charge.(Typical full charge is 12.65V to 12.7V. To discharge the battery I used a battery/alternator tester. I have a voltmeter attached to charger and a current meter in series with battery and battery charger negative terminal.1) At the start of the charge, the charge current was 0.78A and then jumped to 1.52A in a few minutes.2) After 1 hour the charge current is 1.47A. Charge voltage is 13.0V.3) After 2 hours the charge current is 1.48A. Charge voltage is 13.25V.4) After 3 hours the charge current is 1.43A. Charge voltage is 13.46V.5) After 4 hours the charge current is 1.40A. Charge voltage is 13.82V.Note: that the charge current is decreasing as the battery is approaching full charge. This design feature will prevent overheating and extend the life of your battery.6) After 5 hours the charge current is 0.68A. Charge voltage is 14.71V.7) After 5.5 hours the charge current is 0.35A. Charge voltage is 14.67V.8) After 6 hours the charge current is 0.29A. Charge voltage is 14.73V.9) After 6.5 hours the charge current is 0.24A. Charge voltage is 14.72V.10) After 8.5 hours the charge current is 0.20A. Charge voltage is 14.73V.11) After 10.5 hours the charge current is 0.15A. Charge voltage is 14.71V.12) After 11.5 hours the charge is COMPLETE and the charge current has dropped to 0.0A. BATTERY voltage is 13.55V and declining. Charger is in the monitor mode. In monitor mode the charger AC power is 3W measured with a Belkin Watt meter.Almost 12 hours seems like a long time to charge a battery and this isn't even a full capacity car battery. But, it did a good job of gently charging the battery especially when it was near full charge. The important thing to me is the charging current declined as the battery neared full charge. This prevents overcharging and truly tops off the battery to maximum capacity.I tested the battery the next day with a battery tester and it passed well within the "good battery" full charge limits. The results were much better than the charger that came with the battery pack where it tested NEAR "weak".Very happy with the purchase. I would buy this exact model again. Should there be any problem(s) in the future I will update this review.Ships from and sold by Amazon. I originally purchased the Deltran Battery Tender Jr. (021-0123) to keep the battery on my vehicle charged as it&#8217;s advertised of being capable of doing so on the packaging. This battery tender did not charge the battery on my car within the 72 hour window and turned off (Has a built-in timer). I called Deltran (877-456-7901) and was told by customer service that the Deltran Battery Tender Jr. was too small to use on a car/truck battery and that I should have purchased the Deltran Battery Tender Plus. I eventually purchased the Deltran Battery Tender Plus (021-0128) and the Deltran 12.5 ft. extension lead (DBT081-0148-12). The Deltran Battery Tender Jr. works fine on my walk behind lawn mower with electric start and should be fine for anything with a small battery. I would suggest that you purchase the Deltran Battery Tender Plus so you can have the option of using it on more equipment. Deltran should change the label on the Deltran Battery Tender Jr. if it&#8217;s not really intended for car/truck batteries. Check out batterytender.com for Deltrans&#8217; complete line.

Solidly built adapter. Allows me to plug my trailer into the garage when using the lights, charging the batteries or cooling the fridge. A must have for the RVer. This worked great to plug right into my battery tender. I set up my mustang, tractor and RV with plugs so I can easily plug any of them into the charger and unplug them easily with no clamps.  No worries about a clamp coming off and shorting out things either. I have few spare batteries can be used for various car appliances. This tool helps to quickly tap into power of each battery. Also my car battery tester uses the DC adapter (cigarette lighter type), so the test can be done easily on each battery with this adapter. 
This is Battery Tender's "smart" charger which can be used with the new AGM battery technology - which is exactly why I bought it. It works great and my seasonal sports car (allergic to ice and snow) will require fewer batteries now. This is the best product of its type on the market. This is a very nice charger for many batteries, BUT it states AGM (not good for many). An AGM 12VDC VMAX, or Optima type RV or marine battery requires a special charger that will deliver 25-35 Amps, not 8. This is for a very small AGM battery. This cost over $120 and I will use it for regular flooded lead batteries but must buy another for AGM or Gel batteries for my RV. A specialty battery requires a specialty charger, I found out. I do recommend this, would buy again, and I hope this helps. This is a must-have if you have a wall charger as the length is great and if your battery is not close to the charger. I use mine for charging my RV truck battery and the house side battery at the same time, as I have a Battery Tender 'Y' for charging more than 1 battery. This is heavy-duty and works for both my Battery Tender plus and my Battery MINDer's; at a great price. I highly recommend this, and the Y for 2 or more batteries, would buy again, and hope this helps someone. 
Below is the formula:1/3: to the manifold (using brake booster)1/3: to the fuel tank1/3: to the engineYour engine will be much cleaner. Remember: do it at night, otherwise, you will scare your neighbor with dark smoke. If the charging system is completely dead and the engine is running on battery voltage only, this monitor will display green (as in everything is okay) as it it goes into battery check mode.  While the low display voltage will tell you something is definitely wrong with the charging system, the green light can be a little misleading. This item will help keep your battery on full charge,and ready to go all the time, when used properly. Use in conjunction with the extender cord,(will let you park farther from the wall plug). 
This product is a MUST have for anyone who does any type of electrical work (automotive, motorcycle, marine, etc) as it stops any corrosion from starting up or protecting a cleaned up connector... Cheap and easy solution for rentals without getting in trouble with the rental company if the scanner does not pickup the signal when hand holding the unit agains the windshield. It does what it is supposed to do, that is to increase placement distance from the car to the electrical outlet

Charge voltage is 13.0V.3) After 2 hours the charge current is 1.48A. Charge voltage is 13.25V.4) After 3 hours the charge current is 1.43A. Charge voltage is 13.46V.5) After 4 hours the charge current is 1.40A. Charge voltage is 13.82V.Note: that the charge current is decreasing as the battery is approaching full charge. This design feature will prevent overheating and extend the life of your battery.6) After 5 hours the charge current is 0.68A. Charge voltage is 14.71V.7) After 5.5 hours the charge current is 0.35A. Charge voltage is 14.67V.8) After 6 hours the charge current is 0.29A. Charge voltage is 14.73V.9) After 6.5 hours the charge current is 0.24A. Charge voltage is 14.72V.10) After 8.5 hours the charge current is 0.20A. Charge voltage is 14.73V.11) After 10.5 hours the charge current is 0.15A. Charge voltage is 14.71V.12) After 11.5 hours the charge is COMPLETE and the charge current has dropped to 0.0A. BATTERY voltage is 13.55V and declining. Charger is in the monitor mode. In monitor mode the charger AC power is 3W measured with a Belkin Watt meter.Almost 12 hours seems like a long time to charge a battery and this isn't even a full capacity car battery. But, it did a good job of gently charging the battery especially when it was near full charge. The important thing to me is the charging current declined as the battery neared full charge. This prevents overcharging and truly tops off the battery to maximum capacity.I tested the battery the next day with a battery tester and it passed well within the "good battery" full charge limits. The results were much better than the charger that came with the battery pack where it tested NEAR "weak".Very happy with the purchase. I would buy this exact model again. Should there be any problem(s) in the future I will update this review.Ships from and sold by Amazon. I ordered 2 different chargers to maintain my gate opener's deep cycle battery (a simple 4 output charger with extension cords for charging other deep cycle batteries from amazonBattery Tender 022-0148-DL-WH 12V 4-Bank Battery Management System) and this unit has a far superior charging design.The 4 bank battery tender does a simple fast rate charge then switches to a trickle charge at a constant voltage with 4 outputs.This unit pulses the battery under charge and features 3 operating modes with different current outputs for different sized batteries. The selections are motorcycle which also works well for SLA gel cells or AGM batteries, standard automotive starting battery, deep cycle batttery, and off.What makes the CTEK unit special is that it uses a pulse charge in all modes to attempt to desulphate batteries, while the battery tender does not.  This method of charging has proven successful in restoring lead acid batteries that won't take a charge any more.It comes with a waterproof 12V output cable and a set of clips or rings for permanent installation under the hood of your car.  In addition to the LEDs for indicating the type of battery being charged, a second set is provided for empty, 1/2 full, and maintenance pulse charge mode.There is also a noticable increase in quality between the battery tender and this unit - small details like a water sealed housing and gaskets on the connectors indicate quality in manufacture.For a single 12V lead chemistry battery this is a useful, well made tool. bought this to attach to my car battery, and black and decker BM3B 6V & 12V charger. It plugs in nicely, and charges. 
bought this to attach to my car battery, and black and decker BM3B 6V & 12V charger. It plugs in nicely, and charges. Nice high amp (current) rating on this. I epoxy it to a 12ah  12 volt gel battery and I can use it as a jumpstarter oremergency power supply for camping or power outages. You can't say much about this quick disconnect plug. But one for sure: having it installedcharging your motorcycle is much easier than using those old fashioned alligator clamps.If you also interested in buying a battery maintainer the harness is included in this one:&#34;Black & Decker BM3B 6V and 12V Battery Charger / Maintainer&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051D3MP6/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0You may also like to hear that there is a adapter available from SAE-2-USB plug available:&#34;SAE to USB Adapter - Motorcycle Cell Phone Charger&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007VFFQRE/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1So if you also use a navigation system while riding you can easily charge this on the road. 
I also use mine to power my NorthStar 16 gal. yard spayer. I can spray two tanks full before the JNC runs down. As the title says, I am satisfied with my purchase.  I like that there is no extra power supply to keep track of and carry around to charge the device.  As far as I am concerned being able to just plug any standard work type extension cord is genius!  The AC power supply works as advertised but the inverter cooling fan is rather noisy.  You can hear it from one room of the house to the other.  The LED light is smart as LEDs use very little energy.  There are consistent complaints about the air compressor taking forever to inflate a tire.  The problem is not in the air compressor but the little black nipple at the end of the house.  One must, with the lever first up, push the inflation fitting all the way onto the tire valve stem by twisting the fitting and gently pushing until  you can see none of the brass fittings and then push down the lever to connect the hose and open the valve on the valve stem.  If you do this correctly, you will see the actual tire pressure currently in the tire on the air pressure gauge.  If the air hose fitting is not on the valve stem properly, when you turn on the inflator, the air pressure will initially say 0 psi until you turn on the pump and then the pressure will jump up to 100psi.  What is happening in this situation, is that the air compressor is trying to push against a closed valve.  It will VERY SLOWLY push air into the tire.  Make sure you have the fitting right and it will work very quickly.  Black and Decker should put a better air hose fitting on the end of the hose to eliminate this issue.As stated, everything works.  Ultimately, I will use the dc receptacles to charge the device via solar panels through a charge controller.Update as of 9/19/2009I have had this unit for some time now and have been charging it via the 12 volt cigarette lighter with a small 30 watt array using two Sunforce 15watt panels in parallel.  I use a Sunforce 7 amp charge controller to protect the battery in the device. I can easily charge this unit in about 6 hours from a depleted point at which the inverter auto shut off to protect the battery the night before.  I get 5 to 6 hours of light from a standard torche lamp in my living room with a 23 watt cfl installed.  I recently started charging it in parallel with a old jump starter pack I had been given as an anniversary gift at a job. If I am only using 6 hours of the sun, I am not storing all the energy I can.I now run the Electromate in the living room for about 5 hours to power the lamp and the Jump start pack gets a 75 watt inverter plugged into it and I run an identical setup upstairs in my computer room.I want backup power in an emergency and a very good way to get the bugs out is to use it continually so the problems will pop up at I time when I don't really need emergency power, instead of at the most inopportune time. This item will help keep your battery on full charge,and ready to go all the time, when used properly. Use in conjunction with the extender cord,(will let you park farther from the wall plug). 
My last same-sized container anti-seize, standing at attention, lasting me 30 years (home use), so my children will finish this one.About it:It's silver in color, 8-oz. container (a bunch), -65F - 1600F, Anti-Seize, -Corrosion and -Galling; has Lid Brush; label indicates "Made in USA".Specific Use: Ease assembly and disassembly of hardware which experience extreme temperatures and/or corrosive conditions.I've used this routinely, and sparingly for it does not take much - just a light swipe on threads, mating surfaces etc.  Most of my last container went to lubricating boat and boat engine components for very good saltwater corrosion prevention.A general caution is: not apply to business end of sparkplug, O2 sensor etc (lightly on threads/sealing surface only) - else could impact component performance (never seen it happen lol).*UPDATE: I visited Permatex website - wished I'd done so earlier ...

Sadly, its inverter was unable to support my refrigerator. The Duracell DPP-600HD doesn't have enough momentary  output to handle the initial start-up current spike of a refrigerator's compressor motor. The specifications say it can momentarily provide up to 960 watts. This equates to 8 amps at 120v.  Yet, public benchmark figures for a home refrigerator's start-up current indicate 13 amps for up to 1/2 second. Other appliances that use electric motors such as sump pumps are likely to exhibit the same characteristics. My suggestion is that customers immediately test this product with any device they intend to power during an outage.Some important specifications are missing in the Amazon listing.  One of the key statics is the capacity of the internal battery, which is 28 amp-hours at 12 v.  This equates to 336 watt hours.  Yet, AC output is much lower than this presumably due to inverter losses.  These losses increase with power output.  The following table illustrates this.

Will buy this or Mobile 1 Synthetic - can't tell the differnece. It say's that it doesn't fit on my 04 Crown Vic but, it does :) Just to let people know! I work on my own cars, always have, always will. This is a good little checker for coolant clarity, boil over protection, and freeze protection. It isn't so technical, as it just measures density of the liquid, though it shows the clarity of the liquid within the radiator. I have heard that you can do a voltage check as well on coolant, though coolant is cheap and doesn't need to be changed very often (some claim 150,000 miles or 5 years now). Whatever the case may be, checking for coolant color and clarity is always good, and ensuring that you don't boil over or freeze is good to know. 
It installs easy, it is a alot cheaper than letting the dealership put in one and does what it is suppose to do. I cannot say the air quality is any better but it works. Does what it says it does......looks great ! The lock it self looks like a quality built.  Heavy and shiny.  But sadly, it does not fit my 2004 Honda VTX1300c on either rotors. 
Maybe on bus-sized class A motorhomes with larger refrigerators this is useful, but it is not any good for my RV refrigerator (26 ft vehicle, decent sized refrigerator).  I don't use this, as it is too large, and use the single bars instead.  They work well. the Viair 00073 70P Heavy Duty Portable Compressor works great, is small and quiet.  I am still lookign for the right adapter so i can plug into 110V plug and the one i purchased with this did not work. This is a very heavy duty cord. Probably more than I need, as I only use it to power my porable Fantastic 12v fan, in my motor home, when I dry camp. But, bigger IS better, right ? 
I love this unit. Now I know in detail what's wrong with my car before I take it to the shop. This lessens the opportunity that the shop will try to upsell me on a service that I may not need. I also like the idea of being able to log the issues on my computer. I have used it on a 1993 Ford F150; 2001 Nissan Sentra; 3007 Lexus RX350 and a 2001 Cadi Deville I have an issue paying someone $100 for them to plug in a gadget like this to read a code that tells me what could be wrong with my car.  At the same time, I hate the concept that I have to buy something like this to tell me what could possibly be wrong with my car.  That said, I'm glad that they sell this product.  Its great.It works on literally all 1996 and newer vehicles.  When your check engine light comes on, follow the instructions and plug this in.  It will read the code on the computer on your car that you can use to tell what could be wrong with your car.A few things:A) this is the base model of these types of products so you won't get some of the super advanced features of ODBII but it will give you the codeB) You can erase the code with this once you fix your car problemC) It doesn't require batteriesOf note, the codes are not perfect. They're only designed to help you troubleshoot and usually a code can have several root cause problems.  That said, its nice being able to plug this in and know if you have a problem that requires the car to be taken in or if its a $1.99 part that I can replace myself.I bought it because my check engine light came on.  Literally, the source of the problem was an unusual condition that sometimes occurs in cold weather -- no repairs were necessary to my Car...cost to diagnose: the cost of this scanner (which I get to keep for future use).Cost if I had taken it in....likely $100 for pluggin in the machine...AND an unscrupulous mechanic could have chosen from 4 parts to replace (the least expensive $1.99 and the most expensive about $200 + $200 in labor)....hmmm...This is a nice product.  Get it.  Save money. This is a nifty little device that attaches to your vehicle's OBDII port under the dash. It is adaptable to most vehicles (visit Scangauge's website to be sure yours is on the list). Interestingly, it interfaces via an ethernet port. I used it on a Ford Taurus, A Mercury Grand Marquis, and a Dodge Caravan. Yes, it displays real time MPG data. It also gives you the average time weighted average MPG. RPM, MPH,and TPS data- no problem. Coolant temperature, Ditto. Manifold absolute pressure depends on the vehicle. Same with intake air temperature. It does not give the actual O2 sensor reading, only if the loop is closed or open. It will definitely teach you skills to improve your fuel economy. Surprisingly, the larger your engine the better you will do because you can take advantage of low rpm high torque situations. I got 29.1 MPG with my Grand Mark using it (Averaged over 65 miles in city, highway and country backroads passing Amish Buggies) Philadelphia to Lancaster, PA. I would have given it 5 stars but the materials it is made with are lightweight and I'm not sure if it will stand the test of time. It is a very useful gadget, and it is a shame we can't hook it up to a laptop to send the data to the state DOT to pass emissions inspection. I suggest ScanGauge look into this, it would probably only take a software upgrade, I know the hardware is up to task. I also suggest they encase it in shockproof rubber to protect it.This is a follow up review  5000 miles out from the last review. I revised the unit to 5 stars. Its durability has proven the test of time and jockeying between 3 vehicles. It sits nicely above the wheel of my V8 Grand Marquis with no significant dash obstruction. It maves easily from vehicle to vehicle an is capable of taking a hit bere or there. It would still be nice to have a shockproof rubber case but I upped my rating to 5 stars both because it held up well and it helped me average between 24-28 MPG country in my Grand Mark. It paid for itself in gasoline already. Anything more is gravy now. The only thing I suggest is a list of OBD codes to go with the unit. It is no longer as easy to find them using google because the mechanics and auto makers want to keep this information proprietary. Google OBD and the first 50 entries are either discussion boards, parts suppliers, or sensor makers. The same happens when you seek out a specific code. You have to dig but you can find what they mean. A list would be nice. 
A necessary for today's vehicles.My Camry had two outlets  in the front but the demand was very high as my GPS,my phone,my daughters's Laptop and her phone,heated and massaging car seat etc. were all looking for their turn to connect. Hence I ordered this along with an inline fuse and got it installed by a professional by bypassing the ignition switch.Now my GPS and phone charger a  re connected to these outlets and now my GPS (which is my mp 3 music player also) and phone batteries remain charged . and the two factory installed outlets are available for any other requirement. If the charging system is completely dead and the engine is running on battery voltage only, this monitor will display green (as in everything is okay) as it it goes into battery check mode.  While the low display voltage will tell you something is definitely wrong with the charging system, the green light can be a little misleading. Consider this...  The combine cost of your tow vehicle and trailer...  The combine weight of your tow vehicle and trailer...  The fact that your trailer may well weigh more than your tow vehicle...  And that moron that just jumped in your lane then slammed on his brakes...  This is NOT the time to think to yourself, "maybe I should've gotten a better brake controller."  Seriously, when the difference in cost is under $100, is it really not worth buying the best?I've used the Tekonsha P3 for two and half years now and I have nothing but praises to sing!  Features, user friendliness, and results!  This unit has it all.  First lets talk about the mechanism.  It uses a digital G-Sensor as apposed to a physical pendulem.  Why is this a benifit?  Because there are no downhill issues that you see with the physical and analog type sensors.  Prior to digial sensors, the downhill slope would throw off the pendulem and the brake controller either would send a weaker current to the brakes or none at all.  Some people have questioned the reliablity of digital sensors.  But with more than 10 years of full production digital units, complaints are actaully less than the older analog units.  Consider this as well, the sensor is not only quicker but more accurate as well, hard to soft braking is much safer now.  How does it work?  Just like any other accelerometor...it senses the volume deceleration and then computes an appropriate voltage and current to send to the trailer brakes based on a percentage of the user's max output setting.Let's talk interface.  A four button face with a roughly 1.5" LCD display plus a belly mounted manual switch.  With no brakes connected, this unit will dispay the default "Tekonsha Screen".  Once brakes are connected via the trailer plug, the unit will display the "Tow Screen".  It has a large two/three read out that displays 0.0 as a default.  While sitting still and once brake pressure is applied it will jump to approximately 10% of the max set output, after 3 seconds of being stationary it will move up to 25% power.  This is designed to "hold" the trailer if stopped on an incline or decline.  Setting the max brake power is a snap with the two "Up" and "Down" buttons on the left side of the face.  The value moves up and down by 0.1 increments and quite quickly if you hold the button down.  The last two buttons are "boost" and "page" which I will discuss when I talk features.  The last button is the manual brake override.  This bottom mounted spring loaded slider switch will manually add braking power to the trailer brakes (up to the user set max) even without depressing the vehicles brake peddle.  This is a standard feature on all brake contorllers, but I wanted anyone looking for their first brake controller to understand what this was.  Lastly, is the warning screen.  It's a deep red screen with a trailer and a "no" sign.  This indicates that the controller which had previously sensed brakes connected no longer can sense them.  Generally an indication of a poor trailer connection at the wiring harness or a problem with the brakes themsleves.Let's talk features.  I've mentioned the "Boost" button, but what is it?  There are 4 levels of boost for trailer brakes.  Off, LV. 1, LV. 2, & LV. 3.  Boost adds a brief (fraction of a second) burst to the trailer brakes which slows the trailer slightly more than the normal pressure would and keeps it from bumping or pushing the tow vehicle when brake pressure is initailly applied.  Very important if as many are these days, your trailer weighs more than your tow vehicle.  After the burst it returns the voltage and current to the G-sensors reccomended output.  There isn't a real scientific method for figuring what you need to use.  The picture on the home screen shows LV1 as small trailer, 2 as a med tailer, and 3 as a large trailer.  My trailer is a 6K lb. TT and I just leave it on the default LV. 1 boost.  Everytime the units is powered it returned to the default LV. 1.  The unit will power down after 15 mins with no trailer connected AND no input from the brake signal wire.  The "Page" button will take you to a second screen that you navigate with the "up", "down", and "Boost" (now "enter") buttons.  This sceen has some cool features as some useful features.  "Backlight" allows you to brighten or dim the brightness of the display.  "Color" lets you set the color of the display.  (Yeah I know, unessesary, but cool)  The default color is "White" which is more of a light blue.  There's also Magenta, Orange, Dk Blue, Violet, Lt. Green, and Dk. Green.  Red is not availible as it's reserved as a warning color for the "no trailer connection" warning screen.  Back to the page screen.  There's also a VERY USEFUL troubleshooting screen.  It lets you view diagnostics on the fly and over the road that can give you four digit readouts of battery voltage, stoplight (brake input signal) voltage, brake voltage, and brake current.  This screen alone is worth the cost of this brake controller!  When you first connect your tailer do some tests and record the max input you set, the output under normal braking conditions, as well as the brake voltage and amperage.  If down the line you get the feeling the brakes aren't working properly, you can re-run this test and see if it's an electrical problem or not.  Finally when your done, pressing the page button will return you to the "tow screen."Installation.  A snap for anyone that has a factory tow package.  Tekonsha offers plug and play wiring harnesses that plug into most make and model years of trucks.  If you have to have it installed or choose to install it yourself as I did, it can be challenging.  But it's a simple four wire hookup.  A 12V input from the battery (running thru a 30A auto reset breaker NOT a fuse), an output to the brake pin of your 6 or 7-way trailer connector, a stoplight input running to your vehicle's stoplight switch behind the brake peddle, and lastly a frame ground.  The mount can be a little challenging to install because of the akward access to the screws, but it can be mounted at nearly any angle other than strait up or down and provided the face is facing a close to directly rearward as possible.All in all, this is probably the most important review I've ever done.  This controller will save you grief and keep you and your vehicle safe.  Make sure for your safety, your families safety, and the safety of all those on the road you buy the brake controller that does it's job the best.  Buy the Tekonsha P3. 
I was using this to power my Viair 00073 70P Heavy Duty Portable Compressor but with 6amp it doenst do the Job, returned it and went with Schumacher 1216 12V 15 Amp Power Converter, good to go! It does get a bit warm while providing the 5 amps of power to the Koolatron car cooler (which I took into hotel rooms at night), but it did exactly what it was supposed to do so can't complain. One issue: There are two different sizes for so-called "cigarette lighter" outlets. This has the "big" size, which means "small" size plugs can have issues. Solution if that is a problem for your particular plug is simply to use a toothpick to "shim" the small-size plug into the large-size socket. I bought this to power cordless battery chargers and small bathroom appliances for camping.  One problem.  The manual clearly states it should not be used for any of those purposes.  Testing it with a DeWalt battery and charger confirmed this.  The DeWalt charger indicated a power failure and would not charge.From the manual."Certain chargers for small nickel-cadmium or nickel-metal-hydride batteries can be damaged if powered by this inverter. Two types of appliances are susceptible to damage: Small, battery-operated appliances such as flashlights, cordless razors and toothbrushes that plug directly into an AC receptacle.* DO NOT use this inverter with the above two types of equipment.""Some inexpensive audio systems may produce a slight "buzzing" sound when operated with the inverter. The only solution to this problem is to use a sound system with better power supply filtering.""In no event will PowerBrightTM be responsible for any amount of damages beyond the amount paid for the product at retail."Online descriptions, including the manufacturer home page, give no indication of the above important information.If you are looking for an inverter for the above purposes you will want to look into a PURE sine wave inverter.  Make sure you also review the power requirements on your device before you buy the inverter as well.  Underpowered inverters can be harmful to your devices. 
I purchased this to charge and Maintain batteries but the unit I got does not maintain at all and the cooling fan never operates no matter what amp charge setting. Connected to a car battery I start charging and it shows battery is at 70% which is nice and after full charge at 100% the charger goes into Charge/Maintain mode but that's where it stops working like others have reported...came back to the battery after two days and the battery isn't charged and so I unplug the charger and plug it back in and it shows battery at 52%. The battery is connected to 4 10 watt LED lights that come on after dark for 6 hours so I expected this charger to start charging when the battery is down but that is not the case like how my last battery charger/maintainer worked. It only seems to charge and not maintain so It's being returned to Amazon.Don't trust it to keep a battery maintain.Update. Amazon replace charger and was quick about it...but the new charger arrived DOA and now on the way back to Amazon for refund. Done with this brand. After the battery is mostly charged, this charger goes to 16.4 volts and starts boiling the electrolyte. Normally when battery is mostly charged, the voltage should not go that high!!! The charger did not switch to a float mode either as it was supposed to.To make sure it is not a battery issue, I tried to use this charger on 3 different batteries and saw the same result. Charger at 16.4 volts and boiling electrolyte. If I was not keeping a close eye on the charger, it would have destroyed my battery by boiling out all electrolyte. I thought this thing is "smart" and "automatic."Did I also mention that one time I was tried to use the charger(see above for results) it was making a lot of loud noise because of a constantly running cooling fan. I bought this battery for a lantern at my mountain cabin I need to keep charged when the power goes out.  I charged it to a full charge and tested the lantern and it will stay lite for over (8) hours which is longer than the original battery.  You just have to remember only to charge the battery until the green light comes and then unplug it. 
Mobil 1 V-Twin 20W-50 Synthetic Motor Oil for Motorcycle is great synthetic oil for your bike and the price is very competitive. Bought this oil for my '09 Buell xb12ss Lightning Long which has a V2 Harley engine.Read much about the specs of all the different oils and this one was the best synthetic.[...] The K&N KN-171C Harley Davidson/Buell High Performance Oil Filter not only works for me it works for the birds (There is a Red Cardinal that likes to see her image in the reflection of the filter). 
I never had faith in the little digital transducers or tire gauges. This one really changed my view. It is compact, accurate and readings are very reproducible . My only recommendation is to switch the power source to conventional batteries instead of the 4 button batteries.Excellent product Deltran Battery Tender 12-Volt 800 milliamp Waterproof Battery ChargerThe Battery Tender Waterproof Tender operates in essentially 3 stages. It first initiates an absorption charge that attempts to charge your battery to 14.5 VDC at up to 0.8A (or 800mA). This bit of information was not readily advertised, so I was concerned when I heard my battery making gurgling noises while the LED was "amber" for the past 8 hours. This battery was only 2 years old with less than 5000 miles and had been maintained since day 1, so I was sure it wasn't a problem with the battery. It turns out that it was nothing to be concerned about since this charger was designed to be used for long-term storage of batteries.My previous charger, a Black & Decker / Vector 2A "smart" automatic maintainer tried to keep my battery voltage at 14.75 VDC at 2A for over 24 hours. Needless to say, I was concerned when I saw this happening with a brand new Battery Tender. I dug around on their website and discovered a PDF that indicated the Tender would try to reach 14.5 VDC for the absorption phase, at which point it would switch to a trickling charge and finally the maintenance charge. I logged all of the readings and confirmed that once the battery reached 14.4-14.5 VDC, it would start to trickle down finally remaining at about 13.12-13.22 VDC @ 20-100 mA. A modern car's parasitic draw is about 10-50 mA, so the maintenance charge is to compensate for the parasitic draw and for self-discharging of the battery. I discovered the Tender does a much better job at a maintenance charge because I have yet to see the Tender go into the Amber-LED mode, whereas my Vector/B&D; occasionally switches back and forth even on a fully charged battery. I logged some data from the Vector/B&D; and discovered that once the LED is green, it provides NO current to the battery. In essence, the Vector/B&D; just shuts off once it reaches 14.5 VDC - which is not as useful as providing an actual maintenance charge. The Battery Tender wins. Quite a few people have commented that their Sears "smart/automatic" maintainer and other brands constantly switch between the Green and Amber modes. I suspect those chargers are doing the same thing as the Vector/B&D.; They just shut off when the battery is "charged", which is not very good for the battery. It needs to hold a maintenance charge to prevent sulfation.The Tender Waterproof is fully encapsulated with a thermally conductive potting material. This makes the unit quite heavy for such a small device. It uses a quick-disconnect 2-terminal fitting that is commonly used for battery chargers/maintainers. It comes with ring terminals or large battery clamps all fused with a 7.5A ATC fuse. I made my own wiring harness with smaller alligator clips since I don't have room under the hood for large clamps, and I do not want to permanently install a set of ring terminals that can short out or cause other problems in the long-run.Pros: Battery Tender has an excellent reputation for making reliable chargers. The Waterproof unit is quite durable and is insulated from shock, water, corrosion, extreme temperatures and other environmental variables.Cons: At 800mA max current capacity, this charger will work rather slowly for 50Ah or larger capacity batteries, so expect 10-12 hours upon hooking it up to a battery before the LED turns green. The benefit of this is that it prevents boiling the battery or generating a lot of heat due to excessive current.Overall: If you're using the charger in an environment subject to cold or hot temperature swings with plenty of moisture, such as in a detached garage for your motorcycle, boat, stored vehicle, or even a daily driver, I highly recommend the Waterproof unit over the Tender Jr or Tender Plus.UPDATE:I decided to purchase an additional Battery Tender Waterproof because I needed another charger for my daily driver and because I experienced no problems with the first unit. I had my Vespa dealership recharge my Piaggio BV250 battery after winter storage.  They actually used this battery tender to charge it for me.  However, they only sold the Deltran Tender Jr (0.75 Amp).  This charger has a faster charging time than the 0.75 Amp.  My batteries charge in about 4-6 hours whereas the Jr take about double that (though exact timing obviously depends on how depleted your batteries are).  I've used this charger since then and it's been great.  It's simple to use: plug it in, connect the clamps or leads to your battery and wait for the green light to light up (indicating a full charge).  There are two sets of connecting cables (one is a clamp and the other a screw on) which is good depending on your need.  One benefit of these two cables is that they actually fit into each other and can be used to connect your battery to your bike WHILE your battery is outside of your bike - I had to use this feature because I accidentally shut my seat (lock is battery powered) when the battery was out and had to connect my battery remotely.If you have a Vespa or other scooter, I would highly recommend getting this charger.  In cold weather, scooter batteries die in about 3-6 weeks of inactivity. 
I found a Ford 6.0L diesel priced so low I couldn't pass, and, I knew beforehand it'd require certain upgrades to instill natural diesel longevity and I needed a tool to help - enter Scangauge II.Scangauge II has features beyond a simple scan tool, eg Trip Computer (Miles per Gallon; Tank-to-Empty; Cost per Trip), Horsepower, -Mile Time, 0-60mph WOTs, Stopping Distance and others...Neat features but not reason I purchased...Digital Gauges (reason): the Mfr refers to this feature as "X-Gauge"- Screen displays four real-time On-board diagnostics Parameter Identifications (OBDII PIDs) of user choosing- PIDs displayed can be changed via pressing adjacent buttons- Performance Data (MPG, Qtr Mile Time etc) may be displayed together/alongside PIDs- Displays vehicle mfr generic PIDs automatically (gasoline engine)- Displays diesel mfr PIDs (ie EOT, ICT, IPR etc) after user creates an 'x-gauge' by input data from Scangauge websiteWith basic knowledge and study I use this gadget to my advantage, I mean either repair vehicle myself, or, know what's wrong (exactly what's broken) beforehand, to preclude somename repair shop ripping me off - it's way too common.I think it comes ready to troubleshoot gasoline engines, in general, yet I'd to enter math data (avail on website) manually for it to sense and display PIDs unique to diesel.After several days of study/application, my opinion is this tool will help diagnose with near certainty, components which have failed and components in early stage of failure.  Its ability to depict four PIDs simultaneously in real-time allows comparison between what related PIDs reflect per desired and actual.Also note I found most big name Tuners boasting scan ability do not monitor/depict many key PIDs as Scangauge, a huge shortcoming for tuner price.Simply put, the Scangauge II is much more than an OBDII code reader and, it'll be difficult/near impossible to find an item offering same diagnostic capabilities for both gas and diesel engines at price.Update Jan 2014: I've purchased another for my Boy's pickup with a 7.3L.  We both have SCT Livewire 9600 Tuners but due to Livewire 9600's monitoring limitations we have Scangauges connected full time to monitor key PIDs.Kyle The installation of the SG2 is simple: attach the OBD2 connector to the DLC port and attach the RJ-45 jack to the SG2 unit. Routing the cable is really up to the operator. I chose to do it in a crude manner because I don't plan to make it a permanent addition to the car. I zip tied the cable to my HVAC vents and anchored it to the empty traction control hole behind the glove box.I used 1 of the provided velcro kits to affix the SG2 to the top of my steering column so that it is right below the instrument panel. It actually blocks my view of the shift indicator array, although I can still see it clearly if I lean forward.The update rate set at FAST is still rather slow and that is to be expected with the outdated OBD-II network. The "fastest" aftermarket scan tool that I have seen is SCT's Live Link for Ford / GM / Chryslers. If you want anything faster, you are going to have to borrow an OEM's scan tool system.The X-Gauge interface is a bit cumbersome since you are restricted to using 2 buttons to enter alphanumeric characters while if you pause for anything more than 10-15 seconds, the SG2 shuts down. According to Linear Logic, they are working on an updated SG2 with datalogging features so hopefully they incorporate a PC interface to speed up programming and setup times.I have it set to monitor instantaneous MPG, RPM, Vehicle Speed, and a gauge that I frequently switch depending on my mood. I am monitoring the torque converter slip ratio. Whenever it reads below 1.00, it means the torque converter is "slipping". Above 1.00 means the output side of the converter is spinning faster than the input side and theoretically it could just mean engine braking with some torque converter slip. You can program custom X-Gauges to monitor gross engine horsepower or torque input at the transmission.I had previously used a Garmin Forerunner 101 to check my GPS vehicle speed and compared it to my speedometer readout (2000 Ford Crown Vic with mechanical speedometer). It revealed that my GPS speed was about 2-3 mph slower than the speedometer indicated speed. The SG2's vehicle speed readout (from the Vehicle Speed Sensor PID in the OBD-2 system) is approximately 2-3 mph slower than the speedometer reading and I am assuming this is the same readout as my GPS (I didn't get a chance to verify this yet).Some of the gauges I like to monitor are Coolant Temperature, Intake Air Temperature, Transmission Fluid Temperature (XGauge), Torque Converter Slip Ratio (XGauge), Gross Horsepower (XGauge), RPM, Vehicle Speed, and MPG.I still haven't been able to figure out how to work the trip computer properly to display averaged fuel economy. The instantaneous MPG is more important to me because I want to see if anything is not working right on long cruises. I have often wondered if the torque converter was locking properly when I use cruise control or when cruising on the highway.The data collection stability is impressive. I never ran into many problems with Car Code or SCT's Live Link, but SG2 is just more convenient and compact. The backlight colors are interesting as they allow you to choose 4 different values of each RGB component (or 64 possible combinations). I have it set to R=3, B=0, G=0 so that it resembles Pontiac's interior lighting (I drive a Ford).My only real complaint is that there's not a better way of attaching the SG2 to the car. A suction cup mount for the windshield would come in handy since I could mount it near my line of sight without relying on adhesive-backed velcro. The interface is quite intuitive but I would have liked a way to program the X-gauge more easily, like via a PC interface.Bottom line: The SG2 is a great deal if you are interested in data readouts for your car. There are cheaper ways of pulling DTC codes, so the only real usefulness of SG2 is the "realtime" PID monitoring and the trip computer for cars that do not have such devices. If you know someone who is a bona fide gearhead and drives a car made in 1996 or newer, they may appreciate the SG2 as a gift.UPDATE:While the ScanGauge II provided a useful feature for cars without trip computers or onboard monitoring for various PIDs, I have noticed that it began to malfunction more frequently. The gauge readouts began to "flicker" between PIDs. For example, monitoring IGNition, the IGN began to switch rapidly between HPR. Just recently, the entire ScanGauge II shutdown while I was driving. It would refuse to reconnect with the OBD2 network. When it did find a connection, a lot of the text was garbled and it lost all of my trip data except for the total mileage. My car normally maxes out on 300 miles per tank of gasoline, so I was bewildered when the SG2 said I drove over 4000 miles. Other SG2 readers have reported similar quirks, albeit not as serious as the self shutdown and data corruption that I experienced.Many newer cars already have features built-into the car. The Pontiac G8, and Nissan GT-R are two examples of cars that have very developed "trip computers" while many other modern vehicles like the Pontiac G6, have trip computers that can monitor most of the fuel-related data. I think I would have expected better instructions for a USA made product. However, there is a lot of available information on the internet and at other vendor websites, so the installation is very straightforward, simple even. I like the small profile and display options. You would also think that technology today would burn in the settings so that you do not need to keep the unit energized continuously. I do not drive my truck for weeks and I will not leave something that draws milliamps connected so I have to disconnect this when not in use. That was not clear in anything I read about it. 
I tried the Same, model BMW had made for their Parts Department. Even with a discount and the BMW Sticker and a Car Club Discount, Not the Same as the Real Thing. (Returned it Promptly back to BMW) you need the options on what type of connections you are making.Amazon.com comes through again! The Battery Tender has all the Features for your Car, Bike or Outdoor Equipment! The Extra Battery Connectors were first to get added to my cart, then the 25' Extension. It also has traditional Clamp on Clips for regular jobs. Much More flexible for long term needs of a Car Nut, Motorcycle Nut or anything else that has a Battery! 12V and Stored most of the time. Perfect to leave in Float Mode and the Battery life will definitely be extended. Competitive Price too, right to your door! Drove to 3 Walmarts and 2 K-Mart Stores, they were out of stock on all accessories by the time it was Winter. Well I used them as a guide for a fair price.I am going to wire up everything I own and permanently wire them for a Battery Tender, Even the Generator!Bought a Battery Tender Bag to keep all of the Accessories, GREAT Engineering and Options! I will keep you informed on the Made in China edition... Hope the Insulation on the Wires last after reading other long-term owners comments. Probably made out of our recycled Plastics?Enjoy!BatmanDSM I have standardized on AGM starting and utility batteries for all of my vehicles and a 50 watt solar battery charging system used to keep all of my vehicles batteries changed between usage.  I also carry a spare in each vehicle to act as an emergency jump starter system and to run an inverter.I have tried several different OEMs and the Optimas have taken my usage/sometimes abused for years and have not let me down.  That said, I did have one that failed within the first year and Sam's club replaced it under warranty some time ago.  My batteries are not babied and even power a 9000 pound vehicle recovery winch on my Jeep GC.I am also testing a Sear's DieHard Advanced Gold AGM and it has more energy per size than the Optimas have and I may purchase more of this type also due to the extra capacity.  I have been told it is probably built by Odyssey, but can't confirm this.It is difficult to beat Amazon's delivered price on this Optima.  Mine came packed well with no shipping damage. I was first introduced to a mechanics stethoscope quite a few years ago when I used to use a regular physicians stethoscope I had picked up somewhere when needed for car repairs.  I located a mechanics model in a catalog and ordered it there.  I found it to be far more versatile with its long stem conductor instead of the flat plastic head on a physicians model, as well as much easier to use by design.  About a year ago my old stethoscope got run over during one of my more intense repairs, and I have since picked up this very same Lisle model from a local parts store.  The price here on Amazon for this 52500 model is cheaper than what I paid, and at the time of this writing ships free when bundled.  Although there are more expensive models available on Amazon, I cannot imagine anyone needing anything more than what this one offers.  Its solid, durable, and very comfortable to wear.I should point out that a mechanics stethoscope is one of the most versatile tools you can own. Even if you never do any work on cars.  You would not believe the number of uses one finds for this instrument when you have one around. Ever have one of those annoying squeaks or rattles inside your car, or some other place that you can't exactly pin down no matter how close you seem to get to it?  With this baby you will find ground zero on the squeak in a couple of minutes.  In addition to cars, you can easily locate squeaks or noises in any kind of machinery, or in your homes floor and walls. I even used mine to locate an irritating squeak on a neighbors sewing machine.  It is very easy to use, and even a lot of fun at times.As for this model versus a higher priced one, unless you're a highly paid specialist of some kind that prefers the very best, I would pass up the more expensive scopes available here or anywhere else and buy this one.  It is all the scope most of us should ever need, and one of the most handy and versatile tools to have in your home or garage..... Recommended. 
Does a great job cleaning grime that collects on KN filters for my truck and twin intakes on G37s. Less than 10 minutes of soaking and it removes the old oil and dirt. Rinse with water and blow dry with a hair dryer or even a leaf blower and your ready to reapply new oil that allows the flow through fabric to filter out fast flowing intake. The gauge on this wire is only 16gauge and it will not safely power all the items that you may wish to run off your battery. cleans very well removes brake dust and stuck on grime..need to spray on and let soak scrub with brush..hose off..if stains are old or been on rims for awhile you will have to do a second clean but it will remove 95% of grime 
bought this to use with a signal generator, and works great.  does just what I need.  will buy another if needed. Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.  The pickle fork is the last resort for me, as it will damage the balljoint boot.I prefer to use the Snap On balljoint remover.  If that one cannot fit, then I will try this tool.  If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork. I did not install yet.  It looks like it will work fine.  I'll let you know when I am done.Update is that it works as intended! 
This item will help keep your battery on full charge,and ready to go all the time, when used properly. Use in conjunction with the extender cord,(will let you park farther from the wall plug). This is the best thing for keeping your battery up when being stored.Once your batery is up to a full charge, it practicaly uses no power. It only kicks on when the voltage falls below a usable charge. It has a plug in adapter that you can fasten on to the battery permanately and just plug it into the charger when needed. Used with the battery tender plus and with this I can keep the charger at the trunk end of my car with this cable run from the hood underneath it to the back.  Very handy and works great. 
It does what it is supposed to do, that is to increase placement distance from the car to the electrical outlet This is a useful device to have in your car but you must understand it's limitations. In many cars, it will not be as accurate as taking a reading directly off your battery, which you can do with this device, if you buy this inexpensive additional adapter:Roadpro 12V Battery Clip-On and Cigarette Lighter AdapterThe reason for this is that in vehicles where you have to turn on the ignition to ACC in order to power the cigarette lighter port, once you do that, the vehicle's electronics are also powered and will draw power. So, you will see a lower reading on this device than if you take a reading directly from the battery with the key out of the ignition. In vehicles where the lighter port is always powered, this device can be more accurately used directly plugged in to that port.However, for taking a reading of your charging circuit with the engine running, this can be used in the lighter port in any vehicle.Note that you can do all of this with any household multimeter however the chances of you having that in the vehicle are slim. Most all multimeters also require a battery in them so even if you store one of those in your vehicle, the chances are high that when you need to use it, the internal battery will be dead.This Equus unit however requires no internal battery (at least I don't think it has one), so you can just throw it in your glovebox indefinitely.Car batteries typically last around 5 years so after about 3.5 years is when you may want to periodically use this device to check the health of your battery. Basically, anything under 12v after the vehicle has been sitting for at least 4 hours is a sign the battery should likely be replaced. Above 12v and the battery is probably fine as long as the vehicle starts up.When a friend or relative asks me to check their battery, the first question I ask them is "Does your cigarette lighter port work all the time, or just when you put the key in the ignition and turn on the car?". If they say it's always on, I know I can pretty adequately test their battery just through the lighter port. If however they say it only turns on when they put their car to ACC, I know I will have to have them open their hood so I can read the battery directly with the Equus.The other good thing about this is that you could leave it plugged in all the time for a constant monitoring of your electrical system voltage while driving and parked.For the price, this device is nice to have if you understand how to use it.If you want a more robust battery tester that can not only give you the voltage, but also the CCA rating (cold cranking amps), I recommend this:SOLAR BA7 100-1200 CCA Electronic Battery and System Tester This is a great product!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have purchased similar items in the past that did not  perform nearly as well and were not as accurate reading and stable!!You just plug it in to any of your vehicles auxilary power outlets and it lets you know the battery condition with the engine off.  Start the engine and it  lets you know how you alternator is doing by the charging voltage.  It  also has 3 light emitting diodes red, yellow, and green.  Red  (for very low battery or bad battery cell or poor alternator output)  Yellow (for marginal battery charge or low alternator output)and green (for full battery charge and proper alternator output)'It will also give a red if the alternator output voltage is too high or when a battery charger is connected to the battery. It is much more accurate than your gauge on your car unless you have a digital voltmeter in your instrument panel. I use it on all of my vehicles, especially the ones with idiot lights or connect it with an auxilary socked with  alligator clips to the battery of vehicles with no  charge indicator.  It diagnoses problems  relatively quick and  lets you see a problem before you battery goes dead. 
Not only do they not fit, very thin and wonder how long they will last.  Also if you have batteries with the post and screw/nut the latter is not covered. I am very happy with this charger. It will constantly display either the charge percentage or current battery voltage.  I tried to charge an old jet ski battery with it and it was able to tell me the battery was bad.  I have three diesels and they have large batteries. This is capable of putting a good charge on them when dead in only a few hours.  The cords are long enough to set the charger outside the car, so you can close the hood when charging.  My only complaint would be that the clamp jaws don't open wide enough to grab a large battery terminal clamp. Great extension cord and it's really long! Perfect and long enough to reach anywhere in my SUV. Would recommend it. 
I installed one of these springs at the bottom of the door.  As others have said, 1 seems plenty strong to close the door without making it slam.  If you only hold the door a few inches open, it won't latch.  But if you open it like you are walking out it will close tight and the latch engages.I think installing the second spring will make the door slam too hard.  But its nice having the second spring just in case you need it.I installed it using the existing screw on the outside of the screen door (where the hinge attaches).  I think measured up 9" (as the directions say) and drilled a hole such that the spring fits between the screen door and the outside door when they are both closed.- to be clear - when you are standing outside the camper, with the screen door closed, you see the spring go from the hinge on the screen door to the door frame.The pictures in the directions seemed a little confusing to me.  It looks more like they want you to put the spring on the inside of the door.  But then you have the spring dragging across the frame when you open the door, scratching the frame and probably making a lot of noise.My way of installing it has zero noise (the spring is not rubbing on anything) and it works nicely.Just make sure there is adequate clearance between your outside door and your screen door before installing the spring.I will take a picture if I get a chance and post it.*** UPDATE ***I added a picture with notes.We had the camper out for 5 days and the spring worked great.  Using just 1 spring is enough to close the screen door and it even will pull the combined screen & exterior doors closed.  (not hard enough to latch, but closed).  I think I will leave it as-is and keep the second spring as a backup. I use this to open my screen door without having to to open the sliding panel to reach inside to open the door.  Keeps bugs out while making the door easier to open from outside. i use this lube all around the house....door hinges, oven hinges, key locks, sliding door tracks etc.works nicely and doesnt leave a visual layer....dries invisible 
I use Stoner's Invisible Glass strictly when detailing cars (others or my own). It doesn't streak and applies well. It's alcohol based, so its safe for window tint (unlike ammonia-based products such as Windex). Unlike other Stoner's products, it can be purchased in a traditional spray bottle rather than a pressurized can. Great product! This stuff is good for cleaning and leaving a nice long lasting shine especially on dark vehicles ex: black, dark grey, red etc. Some reviews are correct is saying it doesn't hold suds, but you must understand that this product contains conditioners which will do that. Its best to use a bottle attached sprayer "on hose" with solution in it. This will make suds, suds, but want last as again it has conditioners in it. Product smells like hair shampoo, gold color doesn't make paint change in appearance either, some products after long use stays attached because of wax buildup can make your vehicle appear to look the color of stuff you are using. Good stuff, way better than Mothers. If it doesn't clean like you need then go get a bottle of blue dawn detergent. Works great and has a pleasant citrus smell. But man does the mist burn your eyes. Made my interior look new and dried to a natural low shine. Did not attract dust or stay wet like other products. I will be buying more of this. 
It's beyond me how others think they should have gotten 4, or one reviewer thinks she only received one.  It's clear from the description that this is a PAIR of wheel chocks, not two pair, not one chock.  The 2 are NOT "screwed together" as mentioned in another review.  The manufacturer attaches them with a plastic fastener called a "christmas tree."  It's similar to the plastic fasteners that hold interior door panels on a car.  This is removable; the 2 chocks are separated for use.  Granted, it's a little difficult to pull them apart, a pair of pliers helps.  It would be dangerous to leave the 2 wheel chocks attached as shipped to try to prevent a car or RV from moving.Now for some actual, useful information about the wheel chocks.  I bought these to stabilize my cars when jacking them to service brakes, tires, etc.  My garage floor is painted with epoxy paint.  Even with the anti-slip additive in the paint, several other wheel chocks I have tried always slipped and moved on the epoxy floor.  These Blitz Tire Hugger Wheel Chocks have held firm on the floor every time.  As with any wheel chock, it's important to make sure it's firmly wedged between the tire and the floor.  A quick firm kick to wedge the chock in place is all I ever need on my slippery garage floor.I don't think these would be useful outdoors on an unpaved surface, such as with an RV or trailer in the woods.  But then, it dozen't seem that's how they are being marketed anyway, and I haven't tried them in this application.  For working on a car with a jack or ramps, these chocks do the job. CAVEAT: I have a front-wheel drive car, and I *back* into my garage.  The parking mat goes under my rear (un-driven) wheels.  Perhaps that makes my experience different from some of the others.I found about this product from a show on Speed Channel that was talking about garage products.  The host said the big benefit of this mat was that your tire rolled onto the front part of the mat first, holding it down, before it rolled it over the hump.  Thus, this mat didn't need to be fixed to your garage floor.  That's what I wanted: something that didn't need to be permanently attached to the floor.  The guy on TV didn't even mention that it came with tape.I did put a little masking tape on the garage floor to mark where I typically position the mat, so I can remove it (to sweep or whatever) and replace it right back where it goes as needed.  I don't use the adhesive tape it comes with to adhere it to the floor.  In my case, it works perfectly, just like the guys on Speed Channel described.  I've used it for a little over a month now, and my mat simply doesn't move.  (Ok, maybe it moves some ridiculously trivial amount, but for all intents and purposes, it has stayed put for a month.)  If the mat is going under your driven wheels or steering wheels, I can understand how it might move around.Others have complained that the mat is too narrow.  I wouldn't complain if they made it a little wider, but I don't have much trouble hitting it as it is. I've read other reviews where some say that this does not stay in place.  I installed two in my garage, one on each side, for both my vehicles. After marking the optimum spot on my garage floor where I wanted my vehicles to be clearance-wise, I cleaned the floor to remove any/all dirt and grease.  Then, since my floor was pretty cold because it is still winter here in Colorado, I used my creme brulee torch to heat up the concrete so that the tape would bond with the floor better. After placing the parking stop on the floor, I parked my car on top of it over night.  This step might have been overkill, but I wanted to make sure the tape made good contact and bond with the floor.  After over a month of use, both stops are still in place and we are pleased that we can park our vehicles in the same place every time. In summary, take care to find the optimum place to install on your garage floor, prep the floor properly, and this parking stop will work great. 
This idea is the same as the house screen door closers we used many years ago.  A spring that attaches to both the door and the wall.  Thanks for having this, we needed to be able to keep the screen door closed because of our pets and this works great. We have used FOUR different towing mirrors on two different trucks in the past year.These actually work...although my wife is bothered by the F-150 inset mirror on the truck itself, having the 3rd mirror is unnerving to her, but these are SO much better than the strap on mirror setup you see on other systems.These do fit on 2013 F-150 trucks (just don't get for the STX -- different mirrors). I just purchased a 2012 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited and purchased the Rugged Ridge 13305.14 Black Windshield Pillar Rear Side Grab Handles for the back seat and the Rugged Ridge 13505.04 Ultimate Black Grab Handle for CJ Jeep and Wrangler 1955-2010 for the front seat, both of which compliment each other and fit nicely in my new Jeep.  I couldn't be happier with the look, style, quality and most importantly the strength of the handles.  I'm one step closer to off roading thanks to Rugged Ridge!!! 
This is everything you need in a tread depth gauge, and nothing you don't. Here's how you use it: You press the &#34;probe&#34; down into the tread gap to measure the depth. You then rotate the cylinder around to match the exact mark to the line. The measurements are on four sides of the cylinder, making them easier to read than being stacked on top of one another. Being able to rotate the cylinder makes it much easier to measure something as minute as 1/32 of an inch. This comes with 4 rubber feet that you install on the bottom.  Each foot is circular with a slot running from one side to the other that perfectly fits around the metal grate on top of RV stoves.  The board itself has pre-drilled pilot holes and a template that allows you to determine which holes to use for your particular stove.  It's a very well-done product.  The feet keep the unit in place during travel but it comes off easily when you want to use the stove.  The finish is very nice too so it looks excellent in place.  Highly recommend. These scrapers always break at the smallest part of the handle right behind the head. I heated up a length of 3/4 PVC conduit and slid it over the entire handle,allowing it to spread out slightly at the scraper head. Works like a charm, and now it's long enough to reach the center of my truck windshield! 
I have one of these that I use in one of my older cars.  Works great.  I had gotten it at Wal-Mart.  Fast forward, I wanted to get another, so I went to Wal-Mart to try to pick one up.  They didnt have it, just a store brand unit.  Wow, what a piece of junk.  LCD was poor, would flicker because the refresh rate was not right, had one less decimal place to look at, etc.  It was a complete disappointment, considering that at Wal-Mart prices, it was $1.50 higher than the Equus here at Amazon.  I returned it and was super-glad that I could find this one here on Amazon.  I have it in service and it is absolutely great.  It works well, works correctly and is accurate.  It has two units past the decimal place, not just one (the picture shows 12.6 as the reading but it would actually give you 12.63, as an example).This is the unit to get, you cannot go wrong.  My only desire for improvement would be if the color of the LCD could be varied from just green to maybe red as well. Works well, great item, does exactly what I need it to do (keep stuff from falling out on me when I open a door after driving the motorhome anywhere) nd the price was better here than any where else. Held it up next to the Honda OEM I paid more for, almost exactly the same.If someone told me Fram made Honda's filters and just changed the name on the package I wouldn't question it. 
Rain-X makes terrible wipers, but you don't need them if you put enough of this on.Tip: don't put it on the side windows, unless you want all the rainwater rushing up into your car whenever you crack them open. The springs do one thing only, they pull the screen door closed, they do not control closing speed or latch speed. I tried one spring at first and found that it was not enough to hold the door from remaining slightly open if it didn't latch. Two springs and the door actually follows you when entering, and provides quick closing motion from any position when exiting. Also be sure to install the springs in such a way that they do not drag across any part of the frame or door or you'll get a twanging boing with a buzz. The 9" dimension is perfect. I put lengths of straws on each to help quiet them. I like the interaction now because the door actually feels like it prefers to be closed without being overpowering. Not enough tension to close the outer door but who cares, it's the perfect solution to the annoying screen door. The old door holder on my horse trailer had broken and the door wouldn't stay open. This new one works great and was just the ticket. 
i use this lube all around the house....door hinges, oven hinges, key locks, sliding door tracks etc.works nicely and doesnt leave a visual layer....dries invisible After years of being an idiot and trying to gently use my fingers to prevent my door from scraping on the wall of my car port, I bought this. Works exactly like it should... by being a barrier between my door and the wall. The thickness is perfect. It could stand to be a little longer for my inaccurate parking jobs... but very good nonetheless. Even has two holes cut out so you can drill the sucker into a wall if need be.Note: The vinyl tape that it says is frequently purchased with this product will not work on a textured (stucco) wall. Installed in my IS 350. Could have used another few square feet, but it is easy to install once you remove all the carpet, spare tire and rear deck lid factory insulation. Don't forget the license plate and fuel door. 
Clipped onto the doorlock and door latch rods securely and installed onto the inner door release handle nice and firm.  Worked perfectly. No more "nagging" to close the screen door! You could probably buy a spring at your local hardware store for about the same price, but the pre-determined install tension (distance to drill holes) and where to mount the spring(s) makes it well worth the $7. I followed the instructions for screw hole distance and only needed 1 spring. Both springs may pull the door past the latch at rest (without door swinging closed), but a normal entry/exit the single spring has enough to overcome the latch without slamming the door. I installed one of these springs at the bottom of the door.  As others have said, 1 seems plenty strong to close the door without making it slam.  If you only hold the door a few inches open, it won't latch.  But if you open it like you are walking out it will close tight and the latch engages.I think installing the second spring will make the door slam too hard.  But its nice having the second spring just in case you need it.I installed it using the existing screw on the outside of the screen door (where the hinge attaches).  I think measured up 9" (as the directions say) and drilled a hole such that the spring fits between the screen door and the outside door when they are both closed.- to be clear - when you are standing outside the camper, with the screen door closed, you see the spring go from the hinge on the screen door to the door frame.The pictures in the directions seemed a little confusing to me.  It looks more like they want you to put the spring on the inside of the door.  But then you have the spring dragging across the frame when you open the door, scratching the frame and probably making a lot of noise.My way of installing it has zero noise (the spring is not rubbing on anything) and it works nicely.Just make sure there is adequate clearance between your outside door and your screen door before installing the spring.I will take a picture if I get a chance and post it.*** UPDATE ***I added a picture with notes.We had the camper out for 5 days and the spring worked great.  Using just 1 spring is enough to close the screen door and it even will pull the combined screen & exterior doors closed.  (not hard enough to latch, but closed).  I think I will leave it as-is and keep the second spring as a backup. 
It bothers me when front license plate is screwed directly to the bumper.  Considering the cost of these mounting brackets, I wish manufacturers included them as standard equipment; it would show their attention to detail.When I found Cruiser Accessories 79150 Mounting Plate it seemed like a good value.  I especially liked multiple slots for mounting onto the bumper.  These slots provide a good number of mounting and adjustment options.  I used the upper two vertical slots because they were spaced exactly like the existing holes in my car's front bumper.Unfortunately, there was a couple of frustrating issues that spoiled the experience:1.  Four screws that are included with the plate are too long.  I saw them being long and I am glad I checked for this before installing the mounting plate onto the front bumper.  I used included four screws to attach the license plate and the Black Cruiser Accessories 20050 Classic Lite frame to the mounting plate - screws' sharp tips protruded 1/4" from the back of the mounting plate.  If I had installed the mounting plate onto the bumper first and then tried to attach the license plate with the included screws, I would have damaged the front bumper in two places (the bottom two holes ended up over an air intake slot on my car).  I expect all pieces included with the product to be carefully engineered for that product and working properly.  These screws, obviously, are of the wrong size.  The fact that I had to go to Home Depot to find properly fitting screws not only was frustrating, but also increased the overall cost.2.  The thin pieces of plastic at the top and bottom of the mounting plate are too flimsy.  When I unpacked the plate, these areas of the mounting plate were slightly deformed: bent inwards. Fortunately, the license plate covered the problem.When the mounting plate is installed, it looks nice, so I am not completely disappointed; however, I found a similar product from Bell at Autozone, and it was cheaper (though Bell's mounting plate had very long screws too). Very quick and easy mounting and really adds to the look of the rear of the Jeep.  These are metal and not a cheap plastic and mount with included screws into the existing lens cover screw holes. The first one I ordered came without the crossbar and screws, that keeps the knives in place. I returned it, free with Prime and asked that it be replaced, as it looked promising. The second one is fine for my motor home, and mounts to the inside of a cabinet door well. I had to use 1 1/4" screws to fit; it comes with two nuts and bolts for use with the tape, and two 1" wood screws, to be used by themselves or with the tape. I used the two sided tape (4 pieces included), placed and tested it for fit and door closure, and then used the screws (I do not want this dropping on anyones feet!).The inside center of my door is inset with a frame around it and the door-frame held the safe away from the inset by about 1/8" so I used slightly longer screws than provided. If you do the same be sure they will not go all of the way through the door. I recommend this knife safe and not dulling the blades by keeping them in a drawer, or using a heavy wooden knife block.  The steel can fit in a drawer. 
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. Great Fit Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. 
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Great Fit 
The size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous. The funnel is 10" long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6" long. It states that the funnel is 4" x 4" but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2-1/4" in diameter at the widest point.It would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless. GM has two different coils for this vehicle so their fit index isn't correct. One wire set is an 1.4 inches shorter. See other reviews for info. With the right part, they went right on and work as intended. work great for my John Deere X500 
GLAD  I  WENT  WITH  THE  CHROME AND  NOT  THE BLACK ONE, I  HOOKED  THIS ONE UP TO  MY GV1400 MOTORCYCLE IF  YOU  HAVE JUST  A  LITTLE  KNOW  HOW YOU CAN  DO  IT YOUR SELF , ALL  YOU WILL NEED TO GO WITH THIS IS A RELAY THAT DOES NOT COME WITH IT. YOU  CAN  GET IT ON HERE OR ANY PART STORE, I  HAVE MADE MANY PEOPLE JUMP  DUE  TO THE SOUND OF  THE  HORNS  LOUDNESS. IT WORKSI NEEDED ONEIT WAS CHEAPIT DID THE JOBI MAY NEVER NEED IT AGAIN AS I MYSELF DON'T FORCE DOUBLE THREADED THINGS BUT OTHERS ARE APPARENTLY NOT SO INTELLIGENT.$400 STIHL CONCRETE SAW IS BACK ON THE JOBI WIN ANOTHER ONE.I WILL PROBABLY LOOSE IT DUE TO PREDATION ETC BEFORE I NEED IT AGAIN BUT UNTIL THEN I CAN CORRECT ANY CARELESS PLUG SCREWING THAT MAY COME MY WAY. I became aware of this product through Amazon's targeted advertising. My first thought was, "oh one of those things that they say you need to break your windows if your car ever gets trapped underwater."  I don't ever anticipate this happening, but if it were to happen, I will be ready.I see this product having more use in the event of a vehicle rollover, where you needed to get out of the car quickly and are trapped.  The unit separates from the key chain with a pull.  One slice of the seat belt and a punch to the window and you're out of the car.  Worth $10 for sure.  Plus, I think it makes for a better key chain anchor than the stupid things most people have on their key chains. 
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. These worked for my 2005 jeep grand cherokee.  I like how these bulbs will replace any of the three rear lights. Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend. 
Even though Amazon says it does not fit my truck; it does fit my 2002 Chevrolet 2500HD crew cab with 6.0L gas engine. I replaced both sensors and harness. Both sensors were rough looking and the rear sensor had standing water on it. It was a little bit of a chore to get to them because you have to remove the intake but it was not too bad. I tried to be careful, so I enter my car information. Amazon fit checks show that it would fit 1996 Lexus LS400. I ordered and found out it didn't fit. My car has an arm that requires the thin side but this wiper blade is too big to fit. This sunshade is easy to use and folds up to a nice compact size that fits under my seat well. It's a quite large size so is made for an SUV or car that has a large windshield like my Toyota Prius. While it doesn't fit the Prius perfectly, it's the closest size to being perfect.At this price, I have no complaints with this and can recommend it. 
Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.  The pickle fork is the last resort for me, as it will damage the balljoint boot.I prefer to use the Snap On balljoint remover.  If that one cannot fit, then I will try this tool.  If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork. IT WORKS Exact replacement from OEM. Exact fit worked perfect . Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs. 
IT WORKS They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. If you work on peoples stuff you know what a pain in the rear trailer wiring is, always non-functional.  this conncetor works and holds the flat 4 wire firmly. 
I bought 2 of these and have needed to use one once. The car was parked head first in a single garage so jumping car-to-car would have been tough. I was able to jump the car in a couple of minutes using this gem without any trouble. They hold a charge for at least 6 months, which is how often I have been charging them. I've been using this thing for years now. On my older cars and bike I've seen a gas improvement of about 3, 4 miles. At the new cars no visible improvement ( it's bred new so I'd hope it works perfect), just use it as maintenance once or two a month . I had to recently buy a second one of these, after somehow losing the original one I had. Just to give you an idea of how solidly built these are, I bought my first and original one 6 years ago and never had to change the battery a single time. Outside of carrying a set of jumper cables in your car, carrying a quality tire pressure gauge is priceless. 
Great wheel lock that is easy to activate and unlock.  It comes with 3 keys, one of which has a LED light on it.  The product also comes with a reminder cord that attaches to the handle bar as a reminder.  It does just what I was looking for. Good news1) Fair price2) Fits Curt 2" trailer hitchBad News1) Key use a little tricky2) Plastic keyhole cap cover doesn't feel real snugPractice locking/unlocking with the key about 20 times before you start using this so you establish some 'muscle memory' on how to turn the key and remove the locking hardware - it's not like your house key. Not sure how long before the plastic key hole rain/dirt/mud cover is going to stay attached. As title states, purchased for my wifes 2010 NIssan Rogue. Can never be prepared enough when it comes to families and the vehicles we drive. Opened up package and turned on car, plugged it in to make sure it works. BAM... Does just what it was intended to do. 
Inexpensive, yet works as good as the ones sold by Honda dealerships. Made true to specs and fits right into the slot on my Accord 2006.Will buy again. Bought this for work... do a lot of Toyota, scion, lexus oil filters... works good. nice tight fit and hasent stripped anything yet... They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. 
I see that no one has left a review in a while, so they no one may  have ordered for a 2012.I ordered this for my 2012 JK and it does not fit. The circumference for the steering wheel was right but I assume the "thickness" of the steerng wheel has changed as this does not cover the steering wheel correctly (front to back) and I had to remove and return... This is a high quality steering wheel cover that I really liked but it did not go far enough around my steering wheel for my Mazda CX-5 so I returned it. I bought this for a 2012 Wrangler Unlimited Rubicon. Unlike others, mine was fairly cool when I installed it. It was a task to get on, I bent a fingernail completely backwards, but still went on in about 3 minutes.It doesn't cover the entire circumference of the steering wheel's grip, but it isn't supposed to. I'd guess it covers about 60% but, I think it feels good and solid. I fits tight enough to prevent slipping and doesn't cover any of my steering wheel controls. I feel that the added thickness improves grip and prevents hand fatigue.Some other reviews mentioned that the Jeep logos were embroidered. Mine are stamped and painted. I could see them rubbing off a bit over time but haven't experienced it myself. I lined up the logos on parts of the wheel that I rarely use; 10:00 2:00 and 6:00. As far as odor, I didn't notice one, probably due to the air freshener that was already there.The look and feel of this cover are great for the price. It's a neat detail for my white Jeep and keeps the cold at bay. We'll see how it holds up to a Houston Summer. Shipping was fast, although I had issues with the carrier's delivery. I recommend this for style, protection and function.

I use this to open my screen door without having to to open the sliding panel to reach inside to open the door.  Keeps bugs out while making the door easier to open from outside. You have to have this. Mounts most typically on the outside of the RV.. Just tilt the outside door/vent open and Olsen the peacock valve. No tools required!  Very cool! i use this lube all around the house....door hinges, oven hinges, key locks, sliding door tracks etc.works nicely and doesnt leave a visual layer....dries invisible 
I have one of these jacks supporting the rear of my trailer in the driveway, it is rock steady even with four people in the trailer. I like it that these are light weight (steel jack stands can be quite heavy) and I like that these come apart easily and stack up into a compact set for storage.As far as using these for camping: hmmm. They are really too short for my camper, so I'll need to haul 2x6 pieces around to raise them up. Also, the head (the piece that touches the frame of the trailer) doesn't swivel well under load and can pop off of the frame while you are raising the stand. And the steel parts (the nut and the screw) aren't galvanized so they rust. I don't like the idea of keeping my top clamp clevis oriented straight up when using the Hi Lift Jack, because this Handle Keeper will slide down and get in the way of the Jack Handle when using the Hi Lift Jack.It does a good job at holding the handle in place during transport, etc.  I wanted to keep the top clamp clevis rotated so the jack wouldn't be so long when stored in my truck bed (I have a 6' bed and I have the 60&#34; jack). I grew up in the 80's so I remember well playing with Legos.  Building everying from cars to forts.  Well the Tri Lynx Comapny has brought us back our nostalic youth with Tri Lynx Levelers.  These are large square plastic pads (roughly 9"x9"x1" thick) that are stackable to just about any confgiuration you can imagine.  You can stack them in a "column" fasion for leveling jacks.  Or you can stack them in an offset alternating "brick wall" fasion for an interlocking leveler that is safe to drive on without fear of displacement.  They can even be stacked side by side for larger duel wheel RVs.  For my use, I wanted to use them for my leveling jacks and for pads were there was a side leaning tilt.  The box says to never stack more than 4 levelers high for a single configuration.  I've gone to 10 under my jacks and they still feel rock solid once pressure is put on them.I'm on my 4th set of Lynx levelers.  I'm convinced you can't have too many.  With that I fianlly invested in these "Stop'n Chocks"  Wonderful!!!  As I said these can be used under your wheels as well.  So the Stop n' Chalk stacks as the last piece at the rear of the Lynx configuration to allow the driver  just back up against them.  Now these are the most versitle set of leveling / chalking pads you can buy becasue they allow for front to rear leveling and side to side leveling.  If one side of the coach is lower than the other, you can build up just that side and use standard chalks on the other.  Also if you have enough of the Tri Lynx levelers you could potentially place say 2" of lift under a front axel on an tandem configuration and 4 or even 5" under a rear.  The one draw back is that you would need enough to building this as one continous pad (say 8' long or so.)  But like legos, if you have enough, your imagination is the limit.A couple of notes:  You MUST use these in conjunction with TriLynx levelers.  They will not work on their own.  In addition there is a noctch carved out of the front to force the user to stack in the above mentioned "brick wall" alternating fasion so that there's no risk of sepertaion between the levels as the rig is driving on or off the pad.  Also, I stongly suggest a spotter!  Driving a rig on or off a 9" wide "rail" is dangerous and having someone to tell you that you a little too close to the edge is a must.

Works great, nice to have a second cable, but the OBD end of the cable is angled.  In my case, this cable won't work on my Subaru Outback.  I would prefer the option of a straight OBD connector.  Note that the angle connector works on my other four cars (Mazda, Honda, Dodge).

easy installation. put them on the rear sides.good construction.grip feels a little on the small side.good enough for what it is. I attached these to my travel trailer. This product makes it easy to level both front to rear and side to side. The install is easy, just level your camper using a carpenter level of 3 feet or longer.  Set the level from side-to-side on your smooth flooring or counter top. Then set the level from front-to-back the same way on the smooth flooring or counter top.  Now position the Hopkins 08525 levels, one on the side you prefer to work from at the front of the camper, on a flat vertical surface.  Do the same on a side wall near the front corner on a smooth vertical surface.  Use the double stick tape to position, but consider adding pop rivets or small screws to hold the setting for many years.  Holes are provided in the Hopkins levels.Use the front level first to drive onto leveling ramps or boards, then use the side level along with the tongue jack to finish (after you unhitch). Extend your stabilizer jacks and you're set for level comfortable sleeping in your camper. 
I needed this to clear my rear mounted spare tire for trailering. These were impossible to find locally but of course Amazon had them. A must have for SUV's with a rear mounted spare. Right out of the package I used it first on the front tire of my bike and the gauge and pressure release worked fine and then I used it on the back tire and the pressure gauge read zero.  The release malfunctioned after the first use, so the dial would go back to zero right after you pulled the gauge off the tire.  I put it back in the box and returned to Amazon.com immediately!  I do NOT recommend! I have had this item on my jeep for just about 2 years now.  I need it because of the 35 inch tire on my tailgate covers access to the normal hitch area.  It has been used to haul many items and has worked flawlessly.  ( trailer 5x10, boat, 16ft, and a cargo cart with 300lbs in it )  It has zero rust on it and I am very impressed with it over all.  Also noted that I do a lot of 4x4ing with my jeep and have dropped the rear end off a few steep drops and this extension caught the weight of the jeep without any sort of damage to it.  A++ in my book!

Also noted that I do a lot of 4x4ing with my jeep and have dropped the rear end off a few steep drops and this extension caught the weight of the jeep without any sort of damage to it.  A++ in my book! I had to use quite a stack of wood blocks under my travel trailer (TT) jack because I've had the axles flipped on it.  It sits about 4 inches higher than when it was stock.  When I saw this recommended by Amazon I was all over it.  I still use a few blocks of wood along with this just to further minimize the amount of jack travel required.  I would have given it 5 stars if I didn't have to remove the foot from the jack in order to use it. This doesn't fit my 2007 Toyota Tacoma factory hitch.  It needs to be 2 7/8".  The package on this lock reads 2 5/8 but I measured it at 2 3/4.  I'm going to have to grind the bolt.Update, Jan 2014.  An noted I had to grind the inside ends to make this fit in my Tacoma OEM hitch.  Once, it was ground to the proper length, I spray-painted the bolt and have used it to haul a 19-foot trailer and attach my tow hook ever since with no further problems. 
Not rating it high because it will not work on a Openrange lite fifth wheel hitch.  The hitch on these lite's are like a goose-neck hitch which allows to make 90 degree turns in a short wheelbase truck.  The hitch comes down to far and there isn't enough clearance between the hitch and the ground.  The legs would be spread too far out to give any type of support.  What I did was put it under the large bracket that hold the hitch and that did work pretty good.  You cannot attach it to the ball, but overall it seems to control a little of the rocking motion of the trailer. The item itself is built sturdy and I would have rated it a 5 but it not for every fifth wheel hitch. I required an ammonia-free window cleaner for my tinted windows. This does the job quite nicely. It isn't how well it does, rather how safely it does it. These caps fit on top of the Tri Lynx levelers (Tri Lynx 00015 (10)  Lynx Leveler) or by themselves, for under stabilizer jacks or the hitch jack (if you have a light trailer).  They can also be used on top of the levelers, for under the tire(s) to level your RV.  I don't know how much weight they can bare, but they do well with my 3,400lb trailer for all of the uses described above. 
ARB base plate, nice thick plastic, works great.  Essential part of your kit if you carry a Hi-Lift on your truck. I purchased this to secure my motorcycle.  I use it on my 1976 FXE Harley's front rotor.  It works well and secures the front with the lock and visible indication to hopefully make the thief move on to another bike.  The only problem I had with it was I wanted to put it on my rear wheel because that makes it much harder for a thief to take the bike.  My rotor's holes are too small for the pin to fit and the throat barely fit due to my rotor's thickness.  It does however fit well on my front rotor.Bottom line, this is a good, low cost solution to add as one additional layer of theft protection for your motorcycle. Well built with a weatherproof cover; comes with two keys and will protect your hitch or what ever you need to protect. 
Although my camper is a pop up hard sided unit, it has a scissor jack at each corner with small pods attached to the jacks to keep the camper from rocking. These pads keep the camper feet from sinking into the ground and help to keep the camper level and eliminates rocking. They are easily cleaned if you put the waffle side up and let the smooth side touch the ground. The install is easy, just level your camper using a carpenter level of 3 feet or longer.  Set the level from side-to-side on your smooth flooring or counter top. Then set the level from front-to-back the same way on the smooth flooring or counter top.  Now position the Hopkins 08525 levels, one on the side you prefer to work from at the front of the camper, on a flat vertical surface.  Do the same on a side wall near the front corner on a smooth vertical surface.  Use the double stick tape to position, but consider adding pop rivets or small screws to hold the setting for many years.  Holes are provided in the Hopkins levels.Use the front level first to drive onto leveling ramps or boards, then use the side level along with the tongue jack to finish (after you unhitch). Extend your stabilizer jacks and you're set for level comfortable sleeping in your camper. The &#34;feet&#34; on this bar slides off the truck bed sides and makes it worthless.When the ratchet is extended, the mechanism for that ends up out of arms reach when standing outside the truck. 
Everything about these jack stands speaks to quality.  These jacks stands are very well made of heavy gauge aluminum with a hardened steel pin with a bearing lock for the height adjustment.  Some light assembly with a flat head screw driver is required before use.  There's a screw (provided) that threads into the bottom of the base to fasten the stand support (red) and base together.  Another reviewer stated that his stand 'wobbled'. While it's possible that reviewers stand was defective, if the screw is threaded into the hole and tightened down firmly into the base, the stand won't wobble. On my SUV vehicle, the jack points are very close together, so the base of a tripod-style jack stand is too wide for use.  The narrow profile of these stands is perfect and allows me to slip the jack stand behind the jack and under the rear jack point. Once in position, remove the pin, adjust the height and reinsert the pin. I also don't care for the ratchet style jack stands, which have been known to fail.  There are lots of low priced jack stands on the market, but when it comes to safety (yours), spend a few extra dollars are get a pair of these pin-thru aluminum jack stands by Torin.  They work extremely well and they look cool too. Super heavy chain. Adjust chain so the tripod is about 6 inches lower that leveled trailer. Raise tripod using wrench included. Do not supoport full weight of trailer. This is for stabilization of the 5th wheel. In our case in provided extra stabilization for the bedroom. Hitch extender is good for Kayak transport and allows me to secure slippery kayaks to bed, with minimal effort. There are rings on Tee, allow straps and Bunge Cords to effortlessly secure boats to bed.  After securing Kayaks in place with Rope and cords, this method of support and tiedown of ends of Kayaks just makes sense.  Good product, Well made and painted with good coating for corrosion resistance.  Stores easily or hangs from hooks on Garage wall, though it is somewhat weighty.  Yo lil' mamma will struggle to move it, but that's why you have one! Also mounts to support cab level or bed rack level loads like ladders. The ladies will like it's slender frame. You yakkers with hitches, should get you one! 
good bungies, nice compact cover can litteraly fit in from fork pouch, thin but protective and fit a Dyna Glide without windshield very well This cover fits my bike well and is very durable.  The generous size makes it easy to cover and remove, yet it has a snug fit as necessary to handle the wind.  Good product! This sunshade is easy to use and folds up to a nice compact size that fits under my seat well. It's a quite large size so is made for an SUV or car that has a large windshield like my Toyota Prius. While it doesn't fit the Prius perfectly, it's the closest size to being perfect.At this price, I have no complaints with this and can recommend it. 
This shield is identical to the one that came with your helmet.  It ships in a simple plastic package not suitable for storing when not in use, I recommend a storage bag for your spare shields when not in use so they do not get dinged up when in storage or saddlebags. These are great, but they didn't come with a bag.  TheTri-Lynx 00015 Lynx Leveler for RV Leveling Block with Nylon Storage Case, (Pack of 10)comes with a very nice bag that would actually work well for these wheel chocks.  It would be nice if they had included that or another bag for these (that would have earned the product 5 stars). This is a life saver when your regular tires won't grip the ice or the snow.  They're easy to put on and they come with a nice storage carry bag 
Used it to dry a machine washed car. Soaked up water easily and quickly. Soft and easy to grab while using. this car wash mitt is perfect for washing my vehicles. it is thick enough to hold the soapy water yet soft enough to not scratch the paint. The wash mitt is soft and holds a lot of wash water, which keeps the car well soaked. I've used the mitt twice now and have gotten scratch-free results both times. I've also washed the mitt twice and air dried it and it has come out soft and like new. 
This is the 'regular' cleaner.  Not as powerful or as effective as the stronger 'plus' version.  So spend the extra few dollars and get the better version. While this fuel system cleaner is pricey compared with many others, it has the highest amount of poly-ethyl-amine (PEA) and as a result it has a very bad smell. However, it is the best fuel cleaner on the market, and I use it every oil change. This is cheaper and is at least equivalent to the other popular fuel system cleaner by Amsoil. It is also about 3x stronger than regular Techron, and it's about the same price when on sale. Excellent product, 5 stars. I actually prefer my Viking Waffle Weaves, Larger, much cheaper, and seem to be just as absorbent.Maybe the other one with foam in the middle is better.... 
Works great for drying the car quickly and easily when its not hot enough out to do it quickly, and you don't wanna have to polish out all the water spots afterwords (Black car). This thing absorbs so much water you won't believe it till you use it, and it just takes a beating and keeps on going. When I first used it I was afraid I was gonna rip it by twisting the water out too hard, nope, just keep wringing it out until its dry and continue on.A little secret to using it, at least I've found it to work better this way. When drying the car, lay the Absorber out flat (unfold it across the surface) and then grasp it at one end at each corner and drag it slowly across the car allowing it to absorb all the water it comes into contact with. This works especially well on horizontal surfaces, but still good enough on the vertical ones as well. This practice also helps to prevent scratching of the surface when small particles get trapped between the chamois and the paint surface and then your hand comes and pushes it right into the paint.Little warning, when it comes, don't smell it. Mine reeeeekkkkkeeedddd! But I just rinsed it out and the smell went away. Yes it is true that you can put it right back into the tube wet (Well to get it back in the tube, you must, because you can't roll it once it dry), but I like to leave the top off of the tube to allow air in there to dry it out before I close it up and that musty gross smell comes back.Long story short: Get it, you won't be disappointed. So you drop it in your bucket and go about your business.  When you dunk your rags or brushed the dirt and grit settles to the bottom out of the way and you can keep right on cleaning without changing out the water so often.  I love this thing.  Wish I had it growing up. Tired of being charged WAY to much pretty much everywhere for a 5 min filter change? I got this for my 2008 prius and you can do the install yourself in under 5 min for almost nothing. Never pay $120 again at the dealer.Your CAF is located behind the glovebox. To get to it, you need to open your glovebox and let it sit open all the way. Empty out your glovebox. If you don't, you'll be cleaning up the contents of your glovebox from the floor when you're done replacing your CAF. Next step is to look on the right side and unhook the dampener. Next, squeeze the rear of the glovebox sides inwards to be able to let the glovebox swing all the way down.Looking inside, you'll see a tray with latches on both sides. Press those latches inwards and start sliding the tray out.When you put your new CAF into the tray, make sure you follow the arrow on the filter as the air is meant to flow through in one direction. The air flow is down. If you forget, the tray has an arrow on it also that says &#34;air flow&#34;.To finish the job, reverse the proceedures above. Slide the tray in, click into place, rotate the glovebox up and let it snap into place, replace the dampener bar, then close the glovebox. 
I like how this fits in my 5-gallon bucket and traps the dirt.  I use a 2-bucket system and this helps clean the microfiber mits, too.  A little pricey, but I don't see replacing it for a LONG time! i have used it a few times and it dise not do what is said of the product the interior doea not come clean it does take up a little dust but thats it ,it did not clean all the dust like it said it would How do you rate these?  They do exactly what they are supposed to do.  What more can I say.  It don't stink no more?!  LOL 
Have used for years. It is the best car wash going. Removes the dirt, bugs and road grime, but, but leaves your wax on the car. This is a must for anybody who wants to keep their car clean between washes. My car sits outside, in parking garages, and old sheds. All of them seem to dump tons of dust on my poor car. This model comes with the wood handle. Others out there have a cheap plastic one. Read the directions on the cover. You're suppose to let it air out after shipping. It has something to do with the wax on the brush. It also will tell you not to worry about it getting dirty. In fact its suppose to work better as it gets dirtier. The duster will work even better if you put a sealant and/or wax on your car. You'll find that you can pull a lot more material off your car. The duster will easily remove pollen, dust, and any other light coating of material. It will remove the dust from hard water and rain deposits, but you'll still see the marks if you look carefully. Buy this product. You're call will thank you! Love bugs in Florida, along with the other flying critters around are a real test for a product like this. Heck, you can saddle up and ride some of the insects that hit the windshield and front paint on your car, motorcycle, and motorhome!  Use this product and they all wash of with vertually no effort.  Works on the windshield glass without effecting wipers.  Cycle windshields become rain dispersing and clear as can be. Te front of my Camper looks like new.Use is after your clean the vehicle completely, do not use wax over it, and enjoy the results!  Oh, don't sit on your car hood after using this product, YOU WILL SLIDE RIGHT OFF!!!! 
I do love this. I took their advice and rinsed it separately from the wash water. Great mitt, and makes the job TONS easier. And when I washed it in the washer with my clothes, just the wringer cycle had it DRY! The Grit Guard is no gimmick - it definitely works. As you continue to wash the car, the wash mitten will get dirty, and all that needs to be done is dip the wash mitten into the &#34;dirty water&#34; bucket, rub the mitten on the Grit Guard a couple times (front and back), and the mitten should come out cleaner then it was during the wash. For me, this has worked really well. I clearly recommend this for anyone who is serious about washing their own vehicles This mitt gets used in the washing of a fleet of vehicles. So far it has stood up to heavy use and holds water and car wash soap very well. 
You can trust that this item works well and does not scratch your paint. I was always skeptical previously and just asssumed these things scratched the car. But my paintless dent removal guy uses one and highly recommended the California Duster to me. He is fanatical about keeping his car totally detailed. And this product works so well that he never even washes his car unless it gets rained on. He just dusts it every morning before he backs out of his garage, and if needed he uses some liquid instant detailer and a microfiber cloth after dusting if he feels like it. It takes a total of less than 2 minutes to dust off an entire car, yet the result makes your car look like you just washed it.I use the California Duster before putting on my car cover so that there is no dust between the car and car cover. If you have a garage, it's quite useful since dust settles on the car during the day when you are out and about and at night, even garaged. You won't have to wash your car as often if you use the California Duster. And dust won't build up if you use it often enough.Before discovering the California Duster, I found that after washing my car, I could only use my car cover for a few days before the car got too dusty to put a cover over. Now I find that I can keep the car dust free and use the car cover for much longer, which in turn means I don't have to wash the car nearly as often.I got the plastic handle California Duster which was significantly cheaper at the time I ordered. Although the wood handle one looks classier and probably feels nicer, the plastic handle one feels plenty sturdy, for the value oriented, get the plastic handle one since it's the exact same brush anyway!I am really very happy with what I paid for the Calfornia Duster and would not hesitate to recommend one to anyone with a car or motorcycle. Just be aware what it is not made for a car that is wet or very dirty. My only complaint is that it is not actually made in Calfornia. When I bought a new car last year I wanted to get all new cleaning supplies so after some research I ended up buying this Mequiar's package and it was a great investment! I put everything in an easy to carry plastic tool holder I had so I'm able to take everything out to the driveway when I wash the car and use what I need at the time.I regularly use the wash mitt, car wash and Quik Interior Detailer to get quick clean great looking results. One day after washing I noticed something on the paint that felt kind of rough. I rubbed down that area with a clay bar then applied some wax and it was better than new again.The car wash is great because you don't have to use much at all for a bucket full of wash. I have plans to wax the entire car real soon to see how the Gold Class wax is to use but haven't yet. I'm not a professional and I haven't spent a lot of time detailing my car, but I did some research and wanted to get the best feel and look for my car and tried this product. I've heard everyone talk about the clay and I really don't know the difference, but that may be simply that I am new to detailing my car. Anyway, it took the contaminants off my car and make it as smooth as glass. I can tell from using it that it was smoothing out the surface of the car in seconds! And it was fun! I took the time and did my car in less than an hour and it's look great ever since. 
What can I say it's an air filter for a car, it fit and came in a box.  Nuff said I wish there was a guide somewhere that shows you what cars these sunshades fit. I bought this one (Super Jumbo) for my Toyota Camry, hoping it would fit. Well, it did not fit. I had to return it, and order the regular Jumbo sunshade. The regular Jumbo sunshade fits the windshield like a glove. Quality is good, and it folds up to about 14&#34;. So, if you have a 2007-2013 Toyota Camry, DO NOT BUY THIS ONE!!! Order the regular Jumbo size.Amazon, can you please look into getting some sort of reference guide that will show customers the correct vehicle application? This would make buying this product a whole lot easier.CPS I got them for my Camry and they are perfect fit for front or rear seat head rests.Convenient to carry shirts from laundry, hang umbrella, wife's purse and grocery bags.

I picked one of these up as a finishing towel for my cars (both black). I use an Absorber to grab the big stuff and then run this over to catch all the little drips. The cars end up with zero spots and not much effort either. I'm shocked at how much water these towels hold. They're really gentle on the paint and clean up really easily as well. Pick one up! You won't regret it. I just got the Ramps this week and used them for the first time TODAY on my 2003 Chevy Silverado Extended Cab with a 5.3.  It actually has a 2/4 Drop and 20" Wheels with 275/45R20 Tires.  I was on my Asphalt Driveway,  I put the Ramps right it front of my front tires, Get into my truck, and drove right up them!!! Didn't slip AT ALL.  There is a Rubber Pad in the middle Front, pretty thick, not large,  but it seemed to work for me.  I used to be a Professional Mechanic 3 months ago, and always had access to Racks.  I Changed Occupations for the better, and so I no longer have Rack access.  So I got a set of these.Again my truck is lowered, and so I was worried about a ramp not fitting under the front of my truck to drive up.  I had no problem with these like I said.  I put them right up Against the tire, and then drove right on up!!!  The Negative is it's not UP very high, at least on my lowered truck.  On my Low to the ground creeper, I could just get under to change the oil and oil filter.  I wanted to change the Fuel filter also, but that was ALMOST impossible.  It's along the frame railing back a bit near the front of the Gas tank,  I could barley get back enough to just reach the filter and 2 wrench it with one hand to get the filter off.  I did manage though.  I wish I could of do it on a rack at my old Job, but my old Boss is P.Oed that I left.  Now he has to work far more and hired a couple Idiots to take my place.  I wouldn't get my car worked on there now!!!I'm not going to knock it down any stars because it didn't lift my truck up enough as I knew how much it would raise it before I ordered them.  Again, No slipping for my truck and it's Rear Wheel Drive!!!  It didn't Sink in the Asphalt, or Crack, or anything else.  Nice and Solid.  The Price was right as $48, with no tax and free 2nd day shipping for me.  It's harder for me to do oil changes these days, having to do it at home, but then again, I've seen some of the work so called Pro Mechanics do on peoples cars/trucks from different places, and I think I'll stick doing most ALL that I can, other then things that just isn't feasible for me to do at home.  Things like Smog Check. 
cleans very well removes brake dust and stuck on grime..need to spray on and let soak scrub with brush..hose off..if stains are old or been on rims for awhile you will have to do a second clean but it will remove 95% of grime Perfect for washing the RV...strong pole you can scrub as high as you need to go or can leverage. Holds its position when set.  Very pleased. I did not buy this at Amazon, cheaper elsewhere.This wash mitt was nice & thick. Holds a lotta water/suds...could do the whole roof with one dip into the soapy water.You can see the dirt on the mitt as you wash so you know when to dip into a bucket of clean water before returning to the soap bucket for fresh suds.Microfiber can really get the dirt off easily and the thickness doesn't scratch your paint.I bought a case of 6 mitts from an online dealer for $20 
This is a life saver when your regular tires won't grip the ice or the snow.  They're easy to put on and they come with a nice storage carry bag This duster is very handy to clean up your car or truck. It is a fairly large wand that has treated fibers that attract and hold the dust so you can quickly clean your dash, seats and any surface in your vehicle. Dust sticks to the fibers so you are not just stirring up the dust you are collecting it.I like it because I don't have to spray any cleaner and wipe it all up.  This is much faster.  They say you should not wash it as it will remove the treatment from the fibers so I just shake the duster off when I am done.  I can't stand a dusty dirty car and I want to make it look nice and protect my investment.  This duster works quickly and doesn't scratch your car's interior.  The tapered and flat dusting wand even reaches into tight spaces like along the front of your dash against the front window.I like mine and use it all the time! Want to enter your car in the Car Show/Rod Run but it's picked up a bit of Highway dust and dirt?Assuming they have a car wash area (and many outdoor car shows do), hose her off, dry her up and pick up the Meguiar's A3332 Quik Detailer Mist & Wipe Spray and some dry towels -- one quick application to the car will bring her back to good looking glossiness, and you most probably will pick up a few extra points when the judges come around.Meguiars makes great automotive finish products, and has been doing so for a long time. 
I just got one for my 2001 Chevy Suburban and one for my 2006 Ford Five hundred. These covers fit well. They don't slide and they are made of real leather. You can smell the leather scent. One imprtant note is that as a result of these covers being made well and of a thick leather, they do make the driving experience slightly different. They do make the steering wheel thicker. No regrets, the steering wheels on my cars were in poor condition. The alternative would have been to purchace new steering wheels. These jacks are well constructed and easy to use.  Similar to most auto parts store brands.  Paint is thick and well coated, welds are superior, operation is smooth. This product is pricy, but not as much as others that don't fit the bill as well.  Cruiser Accessories 76100 Tuf-Shield Clear Flat License Plate Cover is just that and a good product to use to simply and effectively cover your vehicle's plate with a protective clear plastic cover, while so many other immediately darken from exposure to the sun's rays, this one seems to stay clear. 
I own a few of these because they are decent quality and they work well.  I am happy with the item and I would order another if I had the need. Literally ordered it yesterday and got it today with Amazon prime. Recommended by Scotty Kilmer, so I think it should at least do some good work, My 944 Porsche has a belly pan so I can't tell if it leaks on the floor, but it should do something at least.They raised the price of this item 2-3 dollars, and instead of free shipping, you pay for it now. So it used to be about 8.79+ tax, now its 11 something + tax + shipping... disgusted. This is a great product, love using this....but why the huge price increase?? almost doubled?I use this product on my side windows as well, works as good as Rainex. It really make water bead really good.I really recommend this product when it was going for $5.99....currently double?? I can get it cheaper at the local stores.My last 2 orders for this product either arrived damaged (leaked all over the place) or undeliverable because it was damaged. Still waiting more than a few months for Amazon.com to address this. 2007 2008 2009 2010 i spent more than $4000 buying stuff on Amazon.com  2011....have yet to spend a penny at Amazon.com. All cuz Amazon did not want to address a $12 purchase. 
Not much to say, they are what they are, and at a great price! These are high quality, and I only use the best in my 2003 Subaru Impreza WRX Sport Wagon. ^^ These filters are made by a well-known manufacturer and have great quality, but the price is lower than buying the manufacturers equivalent name brand. Excellent quality. I chose 5 stars because of the quality of the product. It is durable and the welds are clean. I do recommend buying these Hein-Werner jack stands because they are made in the USA. The price may be high but again, would you risk your life for cheaper stands? It may also be the type of steal and materials this company uses that makes this product expensive but worth the price. 
Does a really nice job of collecting dirt and grit at the bottom of the bucket so it stays there and not back on your vehicle. Fits nicely into any standard 12&#34; bucket. This leaves the best 'patina' so far on our exterior vinyl stripping. Eliminates water spots and brings out the reflective highlights without a greasy residue. Does not bleed off when wet either.Normally haven't had consistent results with any Meguiar's stuff, but Barry's got a home run with this. This stuff works very well,spray on and watch the dirt, break dust just drip down to the ground.Rinse very well and don't allow it to dry.You'll be amazed and what comes off of your wheels amd tires 
I had sanded off part of the clear coat around my wheels to deal with some curb rash I had gotten. I had previously used &#34;Bleche White&#34; as my wheel/tire cleaner, and it didn't effect the bare aluminum on my wheel. This stuff does, it left weird white tarnish marks all over the part with bare metal. I can get it off by sanding further with fine grit sandpaper and then polishing with metal polish, but it's really annoying.That being said, it really cleans your tires and wheels well. Better than &#34;Bleche White&#34; for sure, but I will probably stop using it for my car because of the metal corrosion issue. I just finished my first spring washing when a fellow walked by my car and asked if this was 2011 CRV that I waswashing. I told him it was almost 4 years old and he could not believe it. I have to admit that the car does look like due to wonderful Mothers products and some elbow grease.Mothers Carnauba Wax is one of the weapons in keeping my car looking good.I start by washing my car. I don't dry it as this time as water drops will be removed by other steps. Then I clay the car to remove embedded specs, stuck on dirt, and this year I had rubber marks from clearing the snowMothers 07240 California Gold Clay Bar Paint Saving System. I don't clay every inch of the entire car. I just examine the car by sight for any imperfections and by my running my hand over the paint to feel any tiny bumps. When I feel some grittiness or see some dirt on the paint, I generously spray that section with Mothers Showtime Instant Detailer, then knead the piece of clay in my hand and rub it against the spot I identified. Normally, you see the dirt disappear in a few swipes. Sometimes you need to reapply the Detailer and repeat. Kneading is important as you want to work the little pieces of dirt into the clay, and not leave it on the surface of the clay ball where it can scratch the car. I also use the clay on non-painted areas such as glass and chrome if they have stains.After the claying step I wax the car is small sections using Carnauba Wax. It easy to work with.  I put it on a small section (each side of the car is done in 4 sections, for example), by the time I am done spreading it, it is ready to be wiped off, you don't have to wait.  I use micro fiber towels to wipe the wax, using a fresh piece of the fiber on each section.As my final step I apply Back-to-blackMothers 06108 Back-To-Black - 8 ozto non-painted surfaces. This turns the dull plastic into shiny new looking surface. Back-to-black is also effective in removing any wax that might have accidently got on the plastic, that's why I do back-to-black as the last step.Carnauba Wax gives a superior shine.  It is easy and pleasant to work with.  I highly recommend it. I have always been a fan of handwashing my vehicles but over the years I have sometimes come across the problem of leaving small scratches or swirl marks on the surface due to dirt/grit staying on my wash mitt/sponge. After purchasing two grit guards for the 2 bucket wash method, I couldn't be happier!By simply running your wash materials over the guard, it loosens up the dirt and debris removed from your car, sending it right to the bottom of the bucket. This allows you to get a clean mitt every time and it keeps the dirt from landing back on your car.If you are a fan of washing your car and keeping it looking new like I am, I would suggest picking up a grit guard or two. Your car's finish will thank you for it! 
cleans very well removes brake dust and stuck on grime..need to spray on and let soak scrub with brush..hose off..if stains are old or been on rims for awhile you will have to do a second clean but it will remove 95% of grime I cleaned the throttle body on my 2006 Tacoma, 115,000 miles. The TB had so much carbon buildup and it was a little sluggish. The cleaner along with an old tooth brush and rag cleaned the TB to nice new shininess. Really great stuff, it can pick up dirt and easily be cleaned in the bucket, really great if you are using a two bucket wash. 
Just used this on one of the most ugliest tests out there  - engine bay oil, dirt, and grime on a 5 year old car.  Sprayed some on and the paper towel lifted everything in one stroke.  Amazing, simply amazing.  Sure beats Simple Green, which doesn't work nearly as well, and leaves a big odor.  This cleaner doesn't do that - just does its job, which is to clean.  I'm sold. ...in a crowded market of a commodity product.Does a very good job in loosening (if not completely removing) road grime and brake dust before rinsing and washing with a brush or cloth.Wheels: you gotta clean 'em if you're washing your car. This cleaner helps take some of the work of that job. Krud Kutter cleaner/Degreaser makes the claim that it will cleanup a great deal of things.  I tested this on the headlights of my truck and it seem to do an ok job of making them a bit brighter.  Tested on one wheel of the van and it does a nice job in cleaning the brake dust.  This means it should be able to cleanup chimney soot on brick and walls.  That's the next area of testing.  I want to test this on my mother-in-laws East basement windows.  She has some really heavy water and rust stains. If this will clean that it will be one excellent cleaner.  I will amend this review after my findings.  Cleaned the shower wall, door and vanity mirror and it worked ok.  Krud Cleaner isn't really designed for mold killing (it has no ammonia or bleach) but then it won't burn your eyes or lungs like those other ammonia/bleach cleaners.  I was fairly impressed with the product. Price is not that much beyond regular tire and wheel cleaner and if it cleans the bugs off the front bumper it will be definitely worth getting.  Well worth trying and adding to the cleaning shelf. 
Got it for over a year period of time but never got a chance to use it till 2 weeks ago...The engine check light turned on in my VW. Plugged in this code reader and got one OBII Error code. Googled the OBII Error code and found that was something to do with bad catalyst conveter. Checked my manufacturer warranty policy and found that the emission (catalyst converter) warranty would be expired in 2 weeks!! Rushed the car into VW dealer. VW dealer confirmed the catalyst converter was bad and I got free fix and replacement for the catalyst converter.Really happy that this small OBII code reader helped me to understand the source of the problem. Highly recommended. It does the trick - easy to use and not only gives the OBD2 code but also the name for the code so you have some idea of the problem before you research it.When I followed the web link through the software for more information, it asked for VIN and License numbers and had some 15+ diagnostic questions.  I was expecting a more complete analysis after going through all that, but found it wanted $9.95 for a more comprehensive report that would include possible causes and troubleshooting info, which you can find on other web sites through search engines.I would have liked the product to include a concise Quick-start guide, and for the users manual to include a list of codes and brief descriptions.  I didn't find the documentation to be user-friendly.If all you want is a tool to read the code, this is the tool for you.  To make the results useful, you'll need to research the code on the internet. This is a must have tool for people who work on their own cars.  It seems the oxygen sensor is one of the more common failures that cause check engine codes to appear on the OBDII (engine and emissions control) computer system.

It says this plug dont fit Infiniti. No telling what it will tell you since others were told it fit thier cars and it dont after ordering.Anyway these plugs work well. Listed as "Ultimate performance" on NGK site. Fantastic plugs. This will help you guys find out if this plug works in your car. Ignore Amazons parts finder and go visit NGK site instead, since this finder is clearly wrong and causing problems! Just Google=  "NGK spark plug finder" and the NGK finder will be in the top few links. Hope this helps. California 2000 V6 Camry with P1150 and P1155. Two of my code tables show as Bank 1 Sensor 2 A/F sensor so I ordered the Denso 234-4209 O2 sensor. Came in on time and package well protected but looks like its the wrong one - my fault, somewhat. Turns out, as far as I could tell, my two tables from two different sources had it backwards as it should be Bank 2 Sensor 1 A/F and Denso/Amazon order check didn't help much either.Anyway, Bank 2 Sensor 1 is the one on the engine right front (easy to get to) where Denso refer as Upstream Front. I gave it 5 stars base on previous experience, will order this one later.Why the a few of you refer as Bank 1 Sensor 1 and still corrected the check engine light? That would not be this one for the the Toyota V6 but Denso 234-9007 where they refer as Upstream Rear. Am I wrong?Seems like I'm not the only one confused based on superceeded information on P1150 and P1155.This one is for Bank 2 Sensor 1 for the Toyota V6 engine (mine is the 1MZFE). 
Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars work great for my John Deere X500 Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. 
No issues, just as described.  Used to connect my motorcycle to Battery Tender charger.  Also connect to adapter to charge my cell phone. Works great, nice to have a second cable, but the OBD end of the cable is angled.  In my case, this cable won't work on my Subaru Outback.  I would prefer the option of a straight OBD connector.  Note that the angle connector works on my other four cars (Mazda, Honda, Dodge). bought this to attach to my car battery, and black and decker BM3B 6V & 12V charger. It plugs in nicely, and charges. 
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Bought this for work... do a lot of Toyota, scion, lexus oil filters... works good. nice tight fit and hasent stripped anything yet... 
Purchased this as an OE replacement per the factory manual for a Honda powered snow thrower and it works just fine! Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars Perfect for exhaust work.  I bought it for a catalytic converter and o2 sensor project because it is rated for: -30F to 1800F 
This was my first code reader. Its excellent because it reads all da codes. I never use the code book that it came with because i just google the codes on my iPhone and get instant results. Its also easy to delete codes and turn of the check engine light once youve made a fix. This is OBD2 and CAN.  My truck is 1996 F150 OBD2.  It only gives codes and does not detail the code meanings.  I do not find this a trouble.  Code interpretations are all over the internet and auto forums.  It is easy to use and cheap.  I bought this from a knowledgeable guy's recommendation from f150forum.com.  I did not research this further, I just wanna plug and play. My 98 toyota Sienna has 135k miles and recently got a engine check light (CEL).  The code was P0420 (catalytic converter).  A new CAT is expensive, so I gave CRC a try.  I put a bottle of CRC to the gas and followed the instruction.  I also reset the CEL using a OBD II scanner.The result:The smog numbers (CO,HC,O2) were improved by about 5 to 10% but not enough to pass the California smog check. 
This makes it SO easy to charge in conjunction with my battery tender.  So far it has fit all my vehicles batteries ( Acura integra, Toyota Tundra, Toyota Pickup ) Bought this to install with an aftermarket Kenwood Navigation 7120 on my 08 Toyota Tacoma.  It took several hours to install, but it works great with the wheel controls in my Toyota. Did not fit my car's filter harness after Amazon's compatibility tool said it would, there was a 1.5&#34; gap compared to the OEM filter, I have a 2006 Honda Civic Si - steer clear of this if you own the same car 
INNOVA 3030 Diagnostic Code Reader for OBDII Vehiclesi purchased this product last month and i don't know why. it reads your on-board computer alright. but if you want a detail report of a problem you might be having with your check engine light on, they charge you a fee for a complete detail report.AUTOZONE,ADVANCEAUTO AND CARQUEST will test your vehicle free of charge and will provide you with a detail report for free.the fleecing of america continues by online companies.AMAZON, SHAME OF YOU !!!!!!!!

The Tender Jr. does not come with a cigarette adapter so I cut this in half to make two. I purchased 2 lighter plugs for a buck each from China&#8230; with free shipping&#8230; and they are working fine. These aren&#8217;t an exact match with the Tender cables but they fit together OK and are easy to determine polarity with the wire colors. You can also just use this as an extension cord for your Tender. The description states a length of 12-inches&#8230; but it&#8217;s actually 14-inches tip-to-tip on the connectors. Nice item for the price and it&#8217;s made in Mexico. Sizes listed in reviews and the two in the description (15.8 x 10.5 x 5, and 12.5 x 9.5 x 7) don't match to what I received...The bag I received is in between what has been listed in the descriptions:  13.5" x 9" x 6" (empty).While seemingly a good quality bag, with a fair amount of straps and attached rain-cover (hidden in the heel of the bag), it seems the manufacturer (or seller) has no idea how to use a measuring tape!The bag itself is quite nice... good padding, rubberized bottom to prevent sliding, small pockets on either side, and zippers seem of reasonable quality.For the price and bag quality, I'm not complaining.  It works great on my CB750, and it does fit on the pillion of my VT1100c2 (without having to remove my rider backrest)  So if you have standard seating (or a touring/adventure style), this bag will do well for you as a pillion bag, and with a little strap adjustments, it also fits vertical on the front or back of a sissy-bar, or horizontal on a larger luggage rack... What can I say it's an air filter for a car, it fit and came in a box.  Nuff said 
I have a 98 Jeep Cherokee with the high back seats. These covers fit perfectly. The top-to-bottom fit is ever so slightly loose but I don't mind. The side-to-side fit is nice and tight. Quality of the material is good for the part you sit on, so-so for the back but who cares. Where else can you get 2 good covers for the price of 1? I bought two sets / 4 total. I use them near the middle of the lifting range which puts the saddle about 18 to 19 inches high. This is perfect to get my truck off the ground and give me an inch or so of ground clearance to R&R; the tires and do other work underneath the vehicle.I don't need 6t worth of lift, but I like how these j/s have a wide lifting range. With these set for my range (as stated above), they are not teetering at the top of the range like others I've used in the past, but are comfortably in the middle. They are very stable and solid units.It would be helpful if the info stated the lifting range of the units, not just the tonnage they can support as a pair.Min. Lift Height (in.)14 29/32Max. Lift Height (in.)23 1/2 Just opened my mail and a 3.5 inch long air hammer bit is what I measured. Not the 5.7 inch as the ad says on Amazon.com. Hope it still works out OK. I wanted longer one that would reach into the hollow van sliding door, as well as the hollow rear-side panel. It's a nickle coin size and flat on the impact end. I was looking for a arched shape, but this will do? 
Ordered this to put on top of my floor jack which was 3" diameter but it did not fit, it was just sitting on top loosely.  So I'm giving it 3 stars, if it fits your application, I'd imagine it would be rated highly.  So it's back to either a puck or wood for me.Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you, it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews, and leave a comment if you have any questions, I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help. I realize that there are testimonials for this product actually doing what it says it will do.  I have not had an occasion to need it in an emergency.  AND - I hope that I never do.  It does not inspire confidence.  It feels like something that would be included in a child's toy tool set.  Extremely lightweight.  Directions state you must hit the window in a specific location - good luck with that in an emergency.  I was hoping for a tool with enough weight, which added to acceleration, would break the window.  Again, I have not used it, and I will not trust it in an emergency - so I will be looking for a better product.  I do not recommend this item...at any cost. Another of the must haves for RV-ing, If you don't have it when you need it, you will be sorry.' 
If your car has, on the driver's side an air foil that is used to help direct air over the blade, this unit is not compatible with that air foil. You should either keep your original and buy the refill rubber strip or buy the OEM unit from the dealer (or online).Otherwise, the blades work well. Works as advertised in that it allowed my fresh water tank to 'breath' as I filled it to compacity.Before I would get air bubble blow back but not any more. Does what it exactly is suppose to do. One of the bottles cleans the air filter and once the air filter has dried, the other bottle lubricates the filter for the next use. Would recommend 
Works really well for lubricating car door hinges. The spray can design could be improved, the straw frequently comes out while in use and doesn't fit super tightly. Also, the tapered top of the can with a small cap means that the cap easily gets knocked off and thus the can is prone to leaks when being stored. I use this to open my screen door without having to to open the sliding panel to reach inside to open the door.  Keeps bugs out while making the door easier to open from outside. These are ok but they make the door hard to close.  You have to really close the door hard to make sure you do not wear your batter out by leaving the door partially open. 
I did quite a bit of research before deciding on Dynamat.  There are some cheaper competitors that people swear are just as good and they may be, but I just don't trust them as much.  If you do your research you will even see that some people chose to use roofing material that you can buy at Home Depot.  Someone would have to be OUT OF THEIR MIND to put $20 worth of roofing tar into a $20,000+ vehicle.  The only negative thing people have to say about Dynamat is that it is priced high, but if you buy the bulk packs on Amazon you will save yourself a ton of money and is actually a pretty cost effective solution for DIY work.  I have looked around and Amazon has the best price anywhere.Main competitors and my impressions of them.  I have not purchased or used these product, but this is an idea of why I chose Dynamat over them.  I am not a car audio professional by any means.  This is the first time I used deadening on my car and I am writing this to help anyone else who is thinking of doing this.1) RAAMAudio RAAMmat + Ensolite Foam - Most cost effective &#34;legitimate&#34; option.2) Sound Deadener Showdown - &#34;CDL Tiles&#34; + Mass Loaded Vinyl.  SDS would be an interesting choice.  If you look through forums you will see some people who really like this stuff, but I found the website to be confusing and I could not truly make an informed decision one way or another.3)Fatmat:  Cheapest of all automotive dampeners, but one Google search of &#34;fatmat smell&#34; is all you need to know.  Some say it smells awful and some don't, but there is no chance I risk it.  This stuff is super cheap, does not deaden as well as competitors and stinks.  I would use home depot roofing material before this product.  Move on.And to the &#34;REAL&#34; competitor.4) Second Skin Audio- Damplifier Pro + Closed Cell Foam (CCF)-  Although I decided on dynamat, based on reviews and forum comments, I think that Second Skin Audios product line may in fact be superior to Dynamat, but I decided against it for a few reasons.  Damplifier Pro is a good bit heavier than Dynamat extreme.  For most, this isnt going to make a huge difference, but I am lining a performance car with more emphasis on performance than sound.  I want an improved sound system, but if the increase in weight is only going to improve things very minimally it is just not worth it to me.  A lot of people say that Dynamat is the most expensive, but a 36 sq. foot pack of Damplifier pro costs $204+ shipping.  They do have some coupons occasionally, but it is more expensive.The fact is Dynamat is proven to work and is trusted by professionals.  I do not think you can go wrong with Dynamat because the only bad thing people have to say about it is that the price is high which is a bit of a myth.  If you drive a big truck or SUV, want the absolute best sound and aren't as concerned with weight, I would think about the 80sq foot Damplifier Pro shop pack and CCF foam.I turned my trunk into a enclosure with Dynamat Xtreme.  I lined just about every surface, doubling up in a few critical areas and was able to line my trunk with this kit.  If you want to really go out and line an entire car, you will need 100 sq ft+ of this stuff.  If you are doing the trunk and doors like me, you'll need 50-80 sq feet depending on whether or not you plan to cover the entire door.  I would use the bulk kit for anything but the doors.  You can surely use the Dynamat in the bulk kit on the doors, but the door kit strips 12&#34; x 36&#34; and make for a cleaner install because they will run the full length of any door.  It would not be the end of the world to have extra, but I would try to make a good estimate of how much you will need so that you arent leftover with a whole box of this stuff.One final recommendation as I try to unload all of the information I have learned.  Dynamat claims that you do not need a heat gun to install Dynamat Extreme.  That may be true, but after using a heat gun to put the finishing touches on the trunk, I would have to strongly recommend using a heat gun for trouble areas and difficult corners.  I was able to put the Dynamat down so much flatter and nicer by heating it up a bit and rolling it down.  it especially helps to heat corners and tight spots where you cannot get the roller in, because it makes it easier to mash the Dynamat down with your fingers.  I am not going to use the heat gun on the doors however, as I believe that there are more heat sensitive components in there and do not want to chance it Dynamat claims it is not a necessity.I plan on using Dynaliner on top of the Dynamat in the doors (and trunk I think) as well as by itself in a few areas.  I really hope this helps someone.  If you have anything to say about my opinions, or would just like to comment on what I have done, please let me know. I bought this because of its high percentage of concentrated detergent ingredient. I get my gas from a gas station where Top Tier 100% pure gasoline is sold.Maybe I did not need an extra fuel treatment but for peace of mind I used it.From among Redline products I also use D4 ATF.I have yet to do more MPG per tank calculations but the first calculation showed me that Redline fuel treatment has not added any MPG. With the treatment I got the exact same mileage I used to get without it. All other conditions being equal.I bought another bottle to try on our van. I hope to be able to get better mileage with it there.Even if I do not get higher MPG, I would not regret using it as a great cleaner. We do not even know now if Chevron Techron fuel treatment includes that specific detergent or not. No mention of it in the product data sheet.Does anyone know what 'pollution control valve' is in a car? Because here and on redline website it says 'Cleans pollution control valves'. As far as I know there is no such thing in any vehicle. If they mean PCV-positive crankcase valve, even then this is problematic since no cleaning can revive a dead PCV. It needs to be replaced and in many applications the price of replacing it is a few dollars at most. Anyone knows what redline and amazon mean by 'cleaning  pollution control valves' ? What can I say?  it is a replacement cap for the RV sewer connection.  I have not used the regular hose attachment, but I bought this one with it because the cost was not really any more and why not at least have the option.  Maybe someday I'll use it to backflush the black tank, but so far I've felt no need to. 
I did order these for a banding tool, but had to return them because the bands I use don't work with this tool. Although that being the case, these are a well built tool and would probably be the stuff when used with the correct type of band. I used this product on spark plugs ends before installing plug wires or coil packs. I also use it on any electrical connection that may come in contact with moisture. I highly recommend purchasing this if you do a lot electrical work. I bought this tool to help remove stuck windshield wiper arms from BMW's and it works great. Many models have wedge shaped wiper arm posts that are often difficult to remove the wiper arm. Honestly I have never had a stuck battery terminal that I could not easily remove in my 30+ years of wrenching so I cannot give a performance rating in this area since I have never experienced it. But it looks to be up to the task if needed. I own several quality Lisle tools and this tool is no exception. It is sturdy and well made for the price and its intended purpose. My only beef is that the product does NOT match the stock photo. The center adjustable wedge nut is NOT metal as shown in the picture. It is constructed of a dense plastic albeit a higher quality plastic. But plastic is plastic and sellers should not be allowed to misrepresent products they sell. With that said I was alerted to this beforehand by another Amazon reviewer. The plastic wedge nut does not detract from the tools purpose. This is something I am OK with but must point out that the seller misrepresented the product. That is the only reason I knocked it down one star. Due to many sellers having back-stock there are some that still have the version with the metal wedge nut so this fact could be upsetting for customers expecting the exact product represented in the photo. Kind of like ordering a Made in the USA tool only to receive a Chinese version in the package. Please post an updated product photo or at the very least clearly post a warning that the product received may be different than the one represented in the photo. 
I use this mirror in the office to see if there is anyone coming to my desk.  I sit with my back to the aisle and I was startled many times by people who'd stand behind me and snoop on my computer activities.I attached this mirror to the upper left corner of my monitor using the douple sided tape that was pre-attached to the mirror's back, and secured it additionally with a couple of Scotch tape strips .  Now with my periferal vision I notice if there is a reflection change in the mirror, and I will be aware if anyone is approaching my desk. I receive the unit with a black power adapter not white color like the picture show. But no big deal!It comes with all mounting screws and 2 stripes of foam double side tapes. I will not use these tapes, these are some cheap foam type. I don't think it will hold for long. I use black 3M heavy duty exterior double side tape for mounting. I did not use screws because I mount the laser unit underneath the garage door opener. for ceiling mount screw is still the best! I use heat gun to warm up the these tape for mounting, it works like a glue!This unit comes with a mounting bracket, first you have to mount the bracket than hook the laser unit onto the bracket. however the laser unit is not secure on the bracket. It can come loose very easy! which mean it can fall onto your car. So, I add an electric tape at the back of the unit, now the unit stays!The red laser is bright and clear, it can be see clearly in day light. the laser will turns on and stay on about 2 to 3 minutes.9V battery for power outage backup is also a great feature!Great buy! After I got my CV from the auction, I ordered some fancy new headlight bulbs for it. They did NOT come with aiming instructions, which seems silly, if you ask me (but, who asked me, right!).If you've ever searched the web for headlight aiming instructions, good luck! No two are alike! I contacted the manufacturer of the bulbs, and even they had vague instructions. This is the best explanation I found: [...]Step one ... put some gas in the tank. The adjustment will fluctuate a little depending on how much gas you have in the tank (yes, I did it on empty the first time and had to re-adjust the height.), and other load/spring/shock conditions.On a flat surface, you drive the car as close as you can up to a wall and mark the center of the headlight beams. This varies from bulb to bulb, and can range from a well defined rectangle, to a somewhat defined "top," and a vague "bottom." Some bulbs have a kind of a "z" that you align where is zigs and zags.Now, back your vehicle up 25'. This is an "industry rule of thumb," not a mystery, as some manufacturers may have you believe. My lights were shining on the ground at this point, waaaay off!On the back of your lights are little screws with 4 mm hex heads. The top ones towards the outside of the car are for up and down, the lower ones, towards the inside of the car, are for left and right. I tried pliers ... no good, I tried that little crescent wrench ... no good, I went to Sears and bought that pretty miniature set of metric wrenches that goes down to 4 mm for $20 (what was I thinking) ... and I was actually able to do some adjusting by turning and turning the wrench, back and forth, back and forth, dropping it into the frame ... (you know what I'm talkin' 'bout!) ... I did discover (if you're short of cash and have a little wrench already) that by taking the yellow bulb assembly out of the headlight, that the little wrench will spin around without taking it off the post.Since my daughter and I both have these cars, I decided to look for a "real" adjustment tool and found this Lisle product. WOW! Now, I can do BOTH headlights, up and down, AND, right and left, in the time it took me to do one screw before! This thing fits perfectly, it ratchets smoothly, and you can pop it on and off easily! It's like a miracle tool! NOTE TO SELF!!! DO "NOT" BACK THE ADJUSTER SCREW ALL THE WAY TO THE METAL PANEL BEHIND IT WITH THE TOOL ON THE SCREW! THE TOOL WON'T COME OFF AND YOU CAN'T REVERSE THE TOOL OTHER THAN TO REMOVE IT FROM THE SCREW AND TURN IT AROUND! And, no, I didn't actually do this, but I came darn close!K, I digress, sorry about that! Now, you have your car backed up 25' from the wall, hood open, radiator access panel removed (there's a little thumb screw you turn if you're lucky). Lights on "low beam," then cover one of the lights with a dark towel or something, and it will be easier to see the light you're working on.Vertical adjustment (up and down) ... At this point there are several variations of "the rule." I have found on my car that aligning the "top" on the headlight pattern at, or just below, the horizontal centerline for the lights that I marked on the wall is good. This is pretty easy to see for any of the bulbs that I have been using.Horizontal adjustment (side to side) ... This varies a lot! The recommendations in the link in this post has you align the "driver's side" of the beam rectangles (this varies from aligning the centerline of the beam rectangles to two inches to the right of the centerline in some recommendations, and various other recommendations), just up to the vertical centerlines that we marked on the wall. IF you can actually see a definite outline of the beans, this might work. On one car, the beams are defined, on the other I can NOT see a defined left or right edge on the wall, so I had to "play it by ear" and eyeball the adjusters so as to not get them too far in or out, erring on what I thought to be aiming the beams more to the passenger side of the centerlines. Keep in mind that the goal is to illuminate the shoulder, passenger side of the road, the lane you are traveling in, and, I believe, to illuminate somewhat, the oncoming lane without blinding the other driver.Commonsense, and a test drive will tell you if you have it right. If the street signs are glowing like the sun from a mile down the road, you're aimed too high! A quick check of the high beams while in front of the wall may verify your aim. You do NOT adjust high beams, they are supposed to be "self-aiming" when the low beams are aimed, however, they should be somewhat centered over those centerlines we marked earlier.The glory of this tool was then, when I did the test run with the radiator access cowling off already, and I could see the beam was too far towards the driver's side (middle) of the road, I just pulled off the road, opened the hood and popped the adjusting tool on the screw, easily flipped it a few turns (you will know which way after you adjust it a few times) and it came out perfect!Please verify all information, this can be dangerous for everyone if it's not done correctly. Safe driving! 
This drain works good but is starting to corrode. It really should be made from stainless steel or even plastic. Well made with plastic bumpers being the norm, thought I'd use this plastic polish.  It brings the shine to the plastic painted areas just like step 2 does to the metal. 
Fits fine on a greased 2&#34; ball.  The plastic or vinyl is very flexibile, and can be squeezed to create a slight vacuum to help it glide into place. Otherwise the trapped bubble of air underneath needs to be worked out before it fully seats.Recommended. This unit is great. The keyhole is sealed with a rubber cap to prevent dirt and moisture from entering and it is solid and strong. I had to tap the end lightly with a rubber mallet to get it through, but other than that it worked great! Comes with two keys. Nice to have something other than a standard flat or Phillips head screw if you have a nice plate frame or even a backup camera mounted over your plates. If your mounting screws go straight into your car rather than taking the lock nuts behind a bracket, these screws will most likely be too big to fit. I just drilled out the plastic pieces that were mounted to my car and then just threaded these in. Ended up with a nice tight fit. Add the little plastic caps for a nice clean look.Cruiser Accessories 82050 Screw Covers, Black 
This adapter works for certain functions, such as the brakes lights and turn signals.  It is missing the center pin ground needed for the running lights to work.  I purchased another manufacturer's unit elsewhere, and the system now works fine.  This is a cheap, inadequate part. I have a GM 1995 OBDI engine and the adapter they shipped for GM did not fit my connector so I had to return the whole unit.  I'm now back to grounding out the data pin and watching the flash code on the check engine light for trouble codes.  It's important to check your adapter fit before purchase since that's what you will rely on to get the data into the unit.I liked the unit's design - it came in two zipper bags that zipped together to hold the cables and adapters in one bag and hold the tool and book in a separate pouch.  You can also unzip one zipper and lay them side by side to go in a tool box drawer.I wish the adapter would have fit my vehicle - if it did I would have kept this unit because of all the features it offers. As title states, purchased for my wifes 2010 NIssan Rogue. Can never be prepared enough when it comes to families and the vehicles we drive. Opened up package and turned on car, plugged it in to make sure it works. BAM... Does just what it was intended to do. 
bought to change  coil springs on  a camaro they  arived very well  packaged  i would  say  any one  looking for  a set  to  buy  this set you  wont  be  sorry Recently purchased an USB Oscilloscope for use in my projects.  This set of test leads is worth it's cost from Amazon. I do recommend this kit. The dealer wanted to charge me $39 for this filter and I bought this and replaced it myself - will buy again - at the lower price 
I now have three of these adapters.  One on my track car, one on my trailer winch battery, and one on my tractor and they all work grest. With so many vehicles, I needed to replace my 25 year old unit.  This uses dual power, so at home I can plug into AC; on the road the 12 volt plug in my car.  I like the auto shut off feature when pressure achieved. The Wolo Model BA-97 Heavy Duty Commercial Grade Back-Up Alarm is perfect for the rear of any RV of size.  It&#8217;s small ( about 3 wide x 3&#8221; tall and 2&#8221; deep) and loud enough to alert anyone you are backing.  The sound is exactly like what you hear on garbage trucks and many commercial vehicles.Wiring the unit is simple and one of the mounting bolt/screw holes automatically grounds the horn to the vehicle chassis. I used the backup light wiring in the truck to trailer cable that was not used by my trailer to get the 12 Volt positive voltage to the trailer.  I then connected to the trailer wiring block using a14 gauge &#8220;hot&#8221; lead to take the voltage to the backup alarm mounted on the read of the trailer.  Whenever I have the trailer attached to the truck and then shift the truck into reverse Bingo.  The alarm begins beeping.  Of course anytime the truck backup lights are activated, like using the key fob to shut off the truck burglar alarm, the backup horn activates for about 30 seconds. 
I bought this belt for my 2003 Chevy Tahoe with the 5.3L engine and 145A Alternator. Make sure you know which alternator you have BEFORE purchasing this belt. The 105A alternators use a slightly shorter belt. It fits perfectly, doesn't make any noise and works great! You will also need the smallerGoodyear 4040377 Gatorback Poly V-Beltfor the A/C system on these vehicles.My 145 Amp Alternator has a 145A stamped on the side, visible from the drivers side. You could also look for the old belt part number on the existing belt and order accordingly. Order arrived quickly and fit my Saturn Ion Redline. Doesn't seem to be of any different quality than the filter that was in my car previously. My unit did not come with any instructions.  The tool seems too complicated to be very useful, but does work. 
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. This makes it SO easy to charge in conjunction with my battery tender.  So far it has fit all my vehicles batteries ( Acura integra, Toyota Tundra, Toyota Pickup ) Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. 
I have installed several hitches in the past and this is the first one that I have ordered that did not include a ball mount... This review would have been 5 stars if I didn't have to go out on my own and buy the ball mount as well. Didn't have it listed as included but I just bought a Curt mount for my Lexus GS350 which one was included... Lesson here is if you plan to install and use on the same day order a ball mount as well. Install was a total PITA!! The bolts holes used to mount the hitch itself were rusted to no end (2005 MDX) and the ONLY way for me to get the bolts in was to use one of the old ones that held up the tow hook you remove and using that as a thread cutter with WD-40... I also used an old round plastic brush and brushed the threads with lubricant as well!! Install took almost 5 hours due to this unforeseen problem. because I ordered this device along with a backup camera for my RV.  However, when I went to install the backup camera, their instructions said not to install it if there is a back up alarm installed.  The only reason that I could think of was that the current draw of both the camera and the alarm my exceed the fuse capacity of the backup lights and cause it to fail.  Anyway, I am further researching this and hope to get this resolved soon.  So the product looks good and is well packaged.  But I have not tried it yet. I haven't had the need to install this yet but plan to this summer. I always use ACDelco parts when working on my GMC because I know I can't go wrong with genuine GM parts! I will update this review once I install it. Thanks Amazon for having ACDelco in stock when I need parts for my truck.EDIT: Installed this along with theACDelco 15-20676 Idler Pulleyfor my 2000 GMC Sierra 4x4. TIP: If working on a similar truck, make sure you remove the top half of the radiator shroud to make it easy to get to everyting. Install is pretty straight forward. 
I use the Junior model on my wife's '04 Volvo, that has just one battery. This makes sure her car will start every time, and keeps her very pleased with that security. Product works flawlessly. As the builder of a chopper motorcycles (with hefty 113ci S&S; and air rides with built in air compressors) I need to know exactly how much draw is done during a bike's start up. Especially since the compression tappets are vacuum controlled, the ride's suspension is computer aided and there's extensive LED lighting on the vehicle which kicks in on a button press.Using the the Solar BA7 I was able to diagnose exactly what goes on during the bike's fire up and adjust (and lessen!) the start up procedure accordingly. I made changes to the boot up of the bike including the 120+ LED lights based on the huge draw required to start it.Without the BA7 my only indicator of too much draw was a dimming headlight!If you're into any sort of vehicle construction or anything that uses 12V batteries you'll need accurate and informative feedback on what's going on with the battery status.The Solar BA7 seems to report consistently and it works. Worth every penny. HI,This product is a great product that helps you to eliminate rattles/vibrations when you are installing speakers into a vehicle's car doors, rear panels, decks, etc.  It does exactly that and it does it well.There are many claims about it stopping distortion, noise, etc....  However, it should be noted that if you are over powering a speaker..distortion will occur and no padding can stop that.Dynamat has been around for ever and continues to provide a solution that eliminates rattle and vibration.  Use it for that and you will agree that it is a 5 Star Product.  Expect miracles and you will be disappointed. 
Bought this to use withValterra F02-4100 45 RV Hydroflushso I could wash out my tanks.Here is my review of that setuphttp://www.amazon.com/Valterra-F02-4100-45%C2%B0-RV-Hydroflush/product-reviews/B0002UHVAA/ref=cm_cr_dp_synop?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints;=0&sortBy;=bySubmissionDateDescending#R2CUAU2B8XC98QIt works great.I also like that I have this as an emergency backup if one of my valves ever fails. You can't say much about this quick disconnect plug. But one for sure: having it installedcharging your motorcycle is much easier than using those old fashioned alligator clamps.If you also interested in buying a battery maintainer the harness is included in this one:&#34;Black & Decker BM3B 6V and 12V Battery Charger / Maintainer&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051D3MP6/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0You may also like to hear that there is a adapter available from SAE-2-USB plug available:&#34;SAE to USB Adapter - Motorcycle Cell Phone Charger&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007VFFQRE/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1So if you also use a navigation system while riding you can easily charge this on the road. A nice charger. Is also smaller than it appears on the picture. So easy to carry and handle.Unfortunately I had to send it back because it just has the standard clamps to charge.There were no &#34;Quick Disconnect Extension&#34; option to easy plug-n-charge a motorcycle.So I bought the &#34;Black & Decker BM3B 6V and 12V Battery Charger / Maintainer&#34;:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051D3MP6/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0

I bought these horns to replace the weak sounding horn that Toyota puts in the Corolla, Matrix, Prius, Yaris, ect.. These horns are very load to say the least. The Hella box included one low tone horn and one high tone horn. It also included instructions and a single Bosch style relay.There is NO wiring of any kind included with this purchase (this is why I gave it a 4 star). I made my own wiring harness which included a 30 amp fusible link, and the included relay and a relay socket. The following link is to the picture of my install on my 2006 Toyota Matrix XR:[...]Make sure you use the included relay in your install. I know some people have just used the existing single horn wire (not using relay), but these new horns have a pretty heavy amp draw! The last thing you want to do is mess up your factory wiring because of some horns. Do it the right way, and follow the instructions! Your horns will also sound better.You can not beat the price and sound quality of these horns! They will get your attention, I can promise you that.  I do recommend these horns! I installed this brake controller in a 1955 GMC pickup truck that I use for towing. Just follow the diagram for wiring and it just works like a breeze. I like the way you can adjust easily the voltage with the dial on the left and the mounts provided allows you to install it a convenient location under the dash (it works in any position).If you want to install this in a more modern truck without tapping directly into the wires, you will need additional adapters at extra cost. 
The hitch pin locks are wonderful.  High quality, durable, and weather proof.  But if I had to do it over, I might just buy the pin locks (Master Lock Key Alike Set with Receiver and Coupler Latch Locks, 2-Piece Set #2848DAT) without the coupler lock.  First of all, the coupler lock doesn't really deter someone from stealing your RV trailer if they are determined.  You can simply connect the chains to a vehicle and drive off or just cut the coupler lock off.  I use the claw for real security (Tire Claw XL Lock #491KA - ATV, Auto, Trailer Locks).  Therefore, the only thing the coupler lock does is deter the casual thief if you don't use the claw.  The ball is grey plastic with a steel inner, which should work well.  I find that when it's in place, it hangs down and looks kind of floppy.  I may just end up using the hitch pin locks and claw only and forget the coupler lock. The springs do one thing only, they pull the screen door closed, they do not control closing speed or latch speed. I tried one spring at first and found that it was not enough to hold the door from remaining slightly open if it didn't latch. Two springs and the door actually follows you when entering, and provides quick closing motion from any position when exiting. Also be sure to install the springs in such a way that they do not drag across any part of the frame or door or you'll get a twanging boing with a buzz. The 9" dimension is perfect. I put lengths of straws on each to help quiet them. I like the interaction now because the door actually feels like it prefers to be closed without being overpowering. Not enough tension to close the outer door but who cares, it's the perfect solution to the annoying screen door. Works as advertised, be patient and follow directions, it WILL program!  Make sure you turn the ignition key fast, listen for the doors to lock, and you are good to go..... 
I wish there was a guide somewhere that shows you what cars these sunshades fit. I bought this one (Super Jumbo) for my Toyota Camry, hoping it would fit. Well, it did not fit. I had to return it, and order the regular Jumbo sunshade. The regular Jumbo sunshade fits the windshield like a glove. Quality is good, and it folds up to about 14&#34;. So, if you have a 2007-2013 Toyota Camry, DO NOT BUY THIS ONE!!! Order the regular Jumbo size.Amazon, can you please look into getting some sort of reference guide that will show customers the correct vehicle application? This would make buying this product a whole lot easier.CPS They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. These worked for my 2005 jeep grand cherokee.  I like how these bulbs will replace any of the three rear lights. 
Looks and fits the same for a 2000 Toyota Sienna van. I ordered extra so I will not be without any at a later date. Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. 
I have two cars, both of which require the large #14 sheet metal self-tapping screws to mount the plate to the nylon retainers behind the plate (the ones mounted on the car that the screws screw into). Problem is that diameter of the plastic ring that holds the screw covers is too small to take the screw's large diameter head. The maximum screw head diameter that will fit the ring is .435 inch (11 millimeters). Option 1: Replace the nylon retainers on the car, but different cars have different retainers so one must search for new ones that will accept a #12 screw. Option 2: Try to find #14 self-tapping screws with smaller heads. I shopped around for #14 screws with smaller heads to no avail. Option 3: Grind down the screw head's diameter. Option 4 (not good): On one car I used #12 sheet metal screws that have a smaller diameter, but DO fit the rings, and wrapped the threads with tape. This sort of works, but I really can't tighten them down satisfactorily. So I have to check their security now and then. I'm leaving the other car as is for now. Maybe someone has more practical ideas? Sure would like to hear of them. BTW, SEE THE UPDATE BELOW.UPDATE 11/16/13:I think I've found a viable solution to the above problem. I used a #12 sheet metal self-tapping screw, placed a 1/2-inch long piece of ordinary shrink tubing (1/4" i.d.) over the threads towards the pointed end of the screw. Used a heat gun (or you can use a match, BIC lighter or soldering iron) to shrink the tubing which effectively increases the thread diameter to about that of a #14 screw. This allows me to tighten the screw securely and will last much longer than ordinary tape. One more thing: The THICKNESS of the screw head doesn't quite allow the chrome cap to fully snap into place over the nylon ring. The top of the head needs to be filed down a little leaving enough Philips "X" to use the screwdriver. Front side (towards the engine) oxygen sensor fit "exactly." That means there is not a bit of "extra" wire from the sensor to the connector. They do make one with a longer cord, but not sure why, because you can't get your hand/arm in there any better with a longer cord anyway!I did the front sensors on both sides of the car, because someone recommend it to keep things running smoothly on both sides. Glad I did, it seems to be working.Got a wrench? I ordered a fancy pants "socket" from Amazon along with the sensors to get into the "tight" spot. It turned out that the fancy sockets do NOT fit on the front sensors, at least not on this car, and then I ran around town trying to find one of those fancy pants "special" wrenches with the "split" socket on the end, but nobody had them.In desperation, and hoping for the best, I purchased a standard 7/8" combination wrench (where the heck is mine anyway?) to get the sensor off. Oops, I put the wrench on the old sensor and it wasn't even tight (probably why it gave me the DTC)! Installation was easy, aside from the arm and hand contortions getting the plugs loose (try a long shaft screwdriver from below to pop the clip while you're holding the other end from above).Note, on my car, "bank 1" is the cylinder set on the passenger side of the car! I bought this cable chain for my 2005 Honda Odyssey with tire size 265/65R16 in 2008 and have been using every winter.  Practice once before you have to do it under snowy conditions.  I found out the hard way that it's difficult to put even the easy to put chains, if you haven't read the instructions.  I can get the chain on now in under 5 minutes on both the tires.  Slide the chain under the tire and hook up the bottom (split end), then proceed to do the top inside and outside, followed by the rubber tensioner and you are good to go.  Reverse the install and the chain will be off in a couple of minutes!  Before I got this chain, I used to struggle with the chains that require you to lay it down straight, drive over (with someone helping) and make the connections. 
I highly recommend these mirrors. I did a lot of looking and comparing before I bought these. I have a 2006 Toyota Tacoma and these things fit well and do a real nice job. They vibrate a little but not excessive. The little bit of vibration I see doesn't interfere with my view. I also do not extend them very far. The further out you go with them the more they will vibrate. Just extend to the minimum needed in order to be able to see.Before attaching to the vehicle I think it's a good idea to loosen the three screws holding the swivel in place on the bottom of the mirrors and work in a drop of oil. Then do not over tighten these screws. They don't have to be very tight to hold the mirror still and not over tightening allows easy adjustment later. If you find they move when you close the door you can tighten a little more but to start off, finger tight with the screwdriver is all you need. I also placed a couple drops of oil on the aluminum sliding bar and worked it in before attaching. Also, when you bolt the mirror onto the aluminum slide bar, grip the base (the part with the internal threads) with a vise-grip or something (not too tight to crush it), then make sure the lock nut is between the bolt and the bar on the bottom, and then screw the bolt into the base (and through the aluminum slide bar) nice and tight without letting the base turn. You'll notice there are &#34;teeth&#34; on the bottom of the base. These are supposed to sink into the bar as you tighten the bolt. They keep the base from turning when you adjust the mirror. This is another good reason to not overtighten the three screws around the swivel. You want to be able to adjust the mirror from side to side and have it turn only at the swivel and without causing the base to turn against the aluminum slide bar.The bracket will bend the weather stripping on the outside of the window a little. It springs back when the mirror is removed but some of it will be permanent. It's not a big deal and you'll just have to deal with this if you want to use these mirrors. It is not a detriment to the operation of the window.I installed them as far forward as possible so that the top of the bracket was parallel to the ground and the new mirror sits right beside my existing one towards the outside. Tightening the ratchet by hand produced plenty of tension to hold it securely. Releasing the ratchet is another matter. It's too tight to just push it down with your finger. To release the tension I use a short piece of rope and loop it under the sliding buckle. Then I stand right next to the truck with the rope looped around one hand and my other hand on the ratchet release tab. I use my body leverage (knees and back) to pull upward on the rope a little which takes just enough pressure off the belt to allow me to press the ratchet release tab. You don't need to back the ratchet off very far - just enough to get the hook out from under the door. Then just close up the bracket and wrap up the belt around it and you're all pre-set for the next time.For better stability I advise when you're adjusting the belt, place the sliding buckle as necessary so that the crossbar forming the angle is not extended very far, if at all. And, yes, make sure there isn't any dirt behind the buckle or you'll get a scuff mark.You should have the windows all the way down when attaching to the vehicle. The bracket comes close to the window so you need to be careful not to let it scratch the window. After you get the mirror on I advise to raise the window very slowly to make sure that the metal bracket is not contacting (scratching) the window as you raise it. Once you're under way - be sure not to lower the window if there is any sand or debris laying on the bracket right next to the window or a scratch may occur from this action also. I've taken these off and on several times now and we've travelled with them and I've been relatively careful and have never had one scratch my window.On my truck, the doors fit really well and I can tell the difference when the hook for the mirror strap is hooked under the door. The door fits just a tad more tightly than usual. It has to be closed just a slight bit harder to make the latch engage and when I open the door it pops out ever so slightly because of the extra tension produced by the hook being in there on the bottom. I don't see this as a problem. The mirrors are not on there all the time and, even if they were, I think the latch mechanism on the Toyota is stout enough to handle it without any long term problems developing. Just be aware that the hook will slightly change thge way the door latches.The instructions are good, too. Not the usual loosely translated Mandarin. I've tried to supplement here with my own experience. These are good enough for visual rough-leveling of your camper, but they're no precion instrument.  It's tough to install these while holding them level and then sticking them down with the double-sided foam tape on the back side.  Once it's down it's down.  If you stick it on crooked, rip it off and throw it away and start over, or try to twist them level and then put in some screws to hold it there.  The foam tape will allow you to twist them back and forth. This thing is pretty basic. You essentially create a girth hitch with it. You pass the strap around an object, then you take the standing part of the strap and grab a loop of it and pass it through the sewn loop at the tag end of the strap. Then you slide this thing between the standing part and the sewn loop, and when you tighten the strap, the bone prevents the standing part from sliding back through the sewn loop, essentially creating a knot. Any sailer will be familiar with this system it's used alot in quick release knots. 
We received these and they work very well. Make sure that you measure the distance between the wheels and the size of the wheel because there are two different sizes. They work much better than wheel chocks. I purchased this because it fits in the same bag that I keep my trailer ball mount in. This way I always have a lug wrench with me in case I get a flat tire on my trailer. It's a nice quality tool and one of the sockets fits my trailer lugs. Very happy with this purchase and I would recommend it if you're looking for a space-saving way of carrying around a lug wrench. I ordered this to help make a better fit for the bike rack on the front of a Ford Expedition. I was specifically hunting for a fairly short extension because I wanted the bikes to stick out no further than necessary. The selection of holes in this extension allowed me to adjust the fit into the receiver, as well as the fit of the bike rack into the extension. This allowed me to fit the bikes about 2 inches closer to the vehicle than any other extension I was able to find. Very pleased with its performance. 
Made in China poor quality item that does not befit the Robert Bosch brand at all.Not for winter for sure.The origin of the product should be stated at the product page.If I knew it were a MADE-IN-CHINA I would not have bought it. Considering this is made in China, it is a quality product, too bad all my locks are keyed to the some number One question i have now that i read the bottom of the filter box saying "Made in Mexico"We all know "Made in China" means it was made good but with bad materials, so results can be OK or horrible depending on what it is, but how about filters ?Doing research i found that mexico's advantage could be the shipping price, but not much talk about quality of the assembly or material quality. 
I required an ammonia-free window cleaner for my tinted windows. This does the job quite nicely. It isn't how well it does, rather how safely it does it. As advertised everything that this thing claims it can do it will. Also the packaging was nice, big but nice. This is the only oil I've used in my Harley's for many many years.  It does what it's designed to do and it does it very well.  Great stuff. 
I just got two of these for my avalanch. They are very load and easy to hook up and mount. I had to come back  and edit my review because one has blown out and the other one sounds funny w/o both working. I just ordered new horns and try to mount in a different spot. I was unaware you can Not mount these in oem position,evedently they are not water proof, soo, i will be replacing with different horns. ANYONE can do the programming with this remote to their vehicle.  It's very very simple.  I've only had it one day so I can't comment on durability but it's in the same shape as the original remote and works the same.  I give this an A+ so far.  Well worth it. I now own 3 different trailer coupler locks that are &#34;universal&#34; They are not. I have a Jayco Jayfeather (2013) and the hitch is such (wide and high) that no locks fit it. As is the norm, this unit comes in the typical &#34;user unfriendly&#34; packaging that is destroyed upon opening. I'd be glad to sell mine to anyone interested in trying it out. 
Could a wheel chock chock is a wheel chock could chock wheels?In this case: 2.Good build quality, worked well on my AG tires on the rear of the tractor. I would install this on your Jeep as soon as you purchase the vehicle.  They're very easy to install and protect you from scratches that could lead to rust.  The guards fit perfectly on my 2011 Jeep Rubicon 2 door. This fit my 2007 Jeep Grand Cherokee V6. Price was great when I purchased. Can't beat having car parts shipped to your door for free. 
Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars This fits not only the Ecotec, but newer VW TDI's with the canister filter.  Works great, relatively low profile and goes nicely on a 3/8&#34; drive.  I accidentally ordered three (fat fingered the cart), and sold one to a fellow VW driver and one to a guy with a GM. Inexpensive, yet works as good as the ones sold by Honda dealerships. Made true to specs and fits right into the slot on my Accord 2006.Will buy again. 
First I want to say, the UPC tag marks this size as "small".If your wanting to store the Battery Tender Plus in this nice looking bag,I strongly suggest on ordering the Battery Tender Carrying Pouch - Large 500Large-0140.That case will hold all that comes with the Battery Tender Plusand additionally will hold the Battery Tender 25 ft extension cable with ease.The Battery Tender Plus and all the cables will fit inside this small size, 6" x 7 1/4" x 2" bag,but only a certain way, with ease and only before the cables are used.After you wrap the cables back-up, it's much harder to get everything in this bag.Lay the Tender to the right rear Conner of the bag,and it's two attached cords in front of the Tender.Lay both styles of battery clips on the left side to the rear, and the pouch can be easily closed.The inter pocket is perfect for the instruction/warranty papers.The package the Battery Tender Plus comes in is a pop-apart ~ re-usable packageand is just as good for storing the Battery Tender in, for a few yrs,and I often use pop-apart packaging on various items for permanent storage.But I know that after 4 to 5 yrs that this plastic disintegrates.Also, this Battery Tender plastic package takes up 2 ~3 times the space that the utility bag does.So this time I opted for an accessory, it's just plain fun !Footnote: After ordering and receiving this small size,I realized the difficulties to pack all the items that come with the Battery Tender Plus in this bag.I had also decided I wanted to order a Battery Tender 25 ft. extension cable.So I decided to also order the large size bag so I could hold all the original stuff, plus the extension.I've since received that order, and the large size is the one to get for ample room. All in all it took me a little while to get these set up on my 1982 Yamaha XJ650.  Once I found a configuration that I liked and worked for me, I loaded some random things in to the bags and took a spin.  They did quite well very little sag from the bags.  I think these will be great for long rides to carry water, snacks, rain gear, spare visor and some extra tools.  I suggest these bags if you don't want to invest in leather or PVC bags, or just want something to carry some items and you are sick of having a back pack on while riding.  They hold my lunch and laptop for work quite well.  I has been nice the last few days not having to have a back pack on my back.The down side is the way they sit on the bike and they design of the bike make it hard to have the bags on and have a passenger, however this will differ for everyone depending on the bike you have. I used a pair of these to compress the springs on my 1/2 ton truck.  It worked great.  There was minimal flexing of the rods, the clamps went on securely, and I never felt afraid (LOL!).  I'd heard horror stories from friends who used cheaper spring compressors and I am glad I used these.  You will want a 1/2&#34; ratchet with a longer handle because cranking these down on a heavy spring is some work.  It took me about 45 mins a piece to swap struts.The only reason for knocking down a star was that my springs were too thick to get the retention pin in place and I had to tap the compressors into place because the opening between coils was a little snug.  On lighter springs, this should not be a problem.  I used a pair of hose clamps on each side in lieu of the pins.  It didn't seem necessary since the compressors were rock solid, but the safety was worth the trouble for me.These are good compressors, and I would definitely buy them if I had a regular need.  But, many auto parts stores do free tool loans, and these are the ones that my local store loans out.  So, check there first if you want to save a few bucks. 
This product fits like it should and would look really nice if it had been shipped properly!  I got it and the box was all crunched.  The item had no cushioning around it and the front is bent in.  Need to return for a replacement!  It would have been 5 stars if the front had not been bent in and it was packed properly!  Fits right over my 3 burner RV stove and rest on the counter top.  I will be adding rubber feet so that it will scratch the sides of my stove nor my counter top!  To secure it you have to screw it to the counter top.  The back has a hing with 5 screw holes in it where you can secure it or it will stay put without screwing it down.  It came with 5 long screws.  Not sure if i want to secure mine yet.  I have a new RV and not sure i want to put screw holes in the knife holder behind the stove! I have two cars, both of which require the large #14 sheet metal self-tapping screws to mount the plate to the nylon retainers behind the plate (the ones mounted on the car that the screws screw into). Problem is that diameter of the plastic ring that holds the screw covers is too small to take the screw's large diameter head. The maximum screw head diameter that will fit the ring is .435 inch (11 millimeters). Option 1: Replace the nylon retainers on the car, but different cars have different retainers so one must search for new ones that will accept a #12 screw. Option 2: Try to find #14 self-tapping screws with smaller heads. I shopped around for #14 screws with smaller heads to no avail. Option 3: Grind down the screw head's diameter. Option 4 (not good): On one car I used #12 sheet metal screws that have a smaller diameter, but DO fit the rings, and wrapped the threads with tape. This sort of works, but I really can't tighten them down satisfactorily. So I have to check their security now and then. I'm leaving the other car as is for now. Maybe someone has more practical ideas? Sure would like to hear of them. BTW, SEE THE UPDATE BELOW.UPDATE 11/16/13:I think I've found a viable solution to the above problem. I used a #12 sheet metal self-tapping screw, placed a 1/2-inch long piece of ordinary shrink tubing (1/4" i.d.) over the threads towards the pointed end of the screw. Used a heat gun (or you can use a match, BIC lighter or soldering iron) to shrink the tubing which effectively increases the thread diameter to about that of a #14 screw. This allows me to tighten the screw securely and will last much longer than ordinary tape. One more thing: The THICKNESS of the screw head doesn't quite allow the chrome cap to fully snap into place over the nylon ring. The top of the head needs to be filed down a little leaving enough Philips "X" to use the screwdriver. The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around! 
After I got my CV from the auction, I ordered some fancy new headlight bulbs for it. They did NOT come with aiming instructions, which seems silly, if you ask me (but, who asked me, right!).If you've ever searched the web for headlight aiming instructions, good luck! No two are alike! I contacted the manufacturer of the bulbs, and even they had vague instructions. This is the best explanation I found: [...]Step one ... put some gas in the tank. The adjustment will fluctuate a little depending on how much gas you have in the tank (yes, I did it on empty the first time and had to re-adjust the height.), and other load/spring/shock conditions.On a flat surface, you drive the car as close as you can up to a wall and mark the center of the headlight beams. This varies from bulb to bulb, and can range from a well defined rectangle, to a somewhat defined "top," and a vague "bottom." Some bulbs have a kind of a "z" that you align where is zigs and zags.Now, back your vehicle up 25'. This is an "industry rule of thumb," not a mystery, as some manufacturers may have you believe. My lights were shining on the ground at this point, waaaay off!On the back of your lights are little screws with 4 mm hex heads. The top ones towards the outside of the car are for up and down, the lower ones, towards the inside of the car, are for left and right. I tried pliers ... no good, I tried that little crescent wrench ... no good, I went to Sears and bought that pretty miniature set of metric wrenches that goes down to 4 mm for $20 (what was I thinking) ... and I was actually able to do some adjusting by turning and turning the wrench, back and forth, back and forth, dropping it into the frame ... (you know what I'm talkin' 'bout!) ... I did discover (if you're short of cash and have a little wrench already) that by taking the yellow bulb assembly out of the headlight, that the little wrench will spin around without taking it off the post.Since my daughter and I both have these cars, I decided to look for a "real" adjustment tool and found this Lisle product. WOW! Now, I can do BOTH headlights, up and down, AND, right and left, in the time it took me to do one screw before! This thing fits perfectly, it ratchets smoothly, and you can pop it on and off easily! It's like a miracle tool! NOTE TO SELF!!! DO "NOT" BACK THE ADJUSTER SCREW ALL THE WAY TO THE METAL PANEL BEHIND IT WITH THE TOOL ON THE SCREW! THE TOOL WON'T COME OFF AND YOU CAN'T REVERSE THE TOOL OTHER THAN TO REMOVE IT FROM THE SCREW AND TURN IT AROUND! And, no, I didn't actually do this, but I came darn close!K, I digress, sorry about that! Now, you have your car backed up 25' from the wall, hood open, radiator access panel removed (there's a little thumb screw you turn if you're lucky). Lights on "low beam," then cover one of the lights with a dark towel or something, and it will be easier to see the light you're working on.Vertical adjustment (up and down) ... At this point there are several variations of "the rule." I have found on my car that aligning the "top" on the headlight pattern at, or just below, the horizontal centerline for the lights that I marked on the wall is good. This is pretty easy to see for any of the bulbs that I have been using.Horizontal adjustment (side to side) ... This varies a lot! The recommendations in the link in this post has you align the "driver's side" of the beam rectangles (this varies from aligning the centerline of the beam rectangles to two inches to the right of the centerline in some recommendations, and various other recommendations), just up to the vertical centerlines that we marked on the wall. IF you can actually see a definite outline of the beans, this might work. On one car, the beams are defined, on the other I can NOT see a defined left or right edge on the wall, so I had to "play it by ear" and eyeball the adjusters so as to not get them too far in or out, erring on what I thought to be aiming the beams more to the passenger side of the centerlines. Keep in mind that the goal is to illuminate the shoulder, passenger side of the road, the lane you are traveling in, and, I believe, to illuminate somewhat, the oncoming lane without blinding the other driver.Commonsense, and a test drive will tell you if you have it right. If the street signs are glowing like the sun from a mile down the road, you're aimed too high! A quick check of the high beams while in front of the wall may verify your aim. You do NOT adjust high beams, they are supposed to be "self-aiming" when the low beams are aimed, however, they should be somewhat centered over those centerlines we marked earlier.The glory of this tool was then, when I did the test run with the radiator access cowling off already, and I could see the beam was too far towards the driver's side (middle) of the road, I just pulled off the road, opened the hood and popped the adjusting tool on the screw, easily flipped it a few turns (you will know which way after you adjust it a few times) and it came out perfect!Please verify all information, this can be dangerous for everyone if it's not done correctly. Safe driving! I bought a pair of these to use while pulling a 17' Bowrider type boat behind a 2007 Ford Ranger.  With just the stock mirrors, any traffic directly behind the boat was absolutely invisible to me.  With the mirrors, that is no longer the case.I had two problems initially: one due to my own ineptness and the other due to being alone.  When I first got these out of the box and clipped them into the bottom of the door and the window groove, the horizontal bar was not horizontal at all.  Adjusting the straps straightened that out completely.  Also, the mirrors appeared to be fixed in position and any effort to move them seemed as if it might break them.  Well, there are three Phillips head screws that encircle the adjustment ball; loosen them and you can move the mirror any way you want.The major problem remains adjusting the passenger side mirror.  If I had somebody to move it for me, I could adjust it in just a minute while I sat in the driver's seat.  As it is, I had to get out, adjust the mirror, get back in, check the adjustment from the driver's seat and repeat ad nauseum until I finally got it right.  I don't fault the mirror for that.These mirrors come one to a box so you need to order two of them.  The image vibrates slightly but that doesn't really matter in practice:  I'm just looking to see if anything is behind the boat.  It will tell me that. Didn't realize it didn't come with the wiring harness and instead must cut and splice to the original wiring. But there is no way a normal human being can undo the harness anyway. It's behind the manifold where you can barely reach with one hand from the top. There is no way possible to reach it from underneath unless you start unbolting some suspension parts. So I guess this cut and splice model was the way to go. The bad part is you have to do all the splicing while under the car.I haven't installed it yet because the instructions are sort of unclear as to the correct color of the wires. 
Fits for my Honda 2005 Lx.Comes with instruction that have pictures.I have to write more to finish this review. Amazon really needs to check some of their cross reference charts. This does not it a 2011 Kia LX Sorento. Does what it is designed to do and Amazon has great prices on them. But, if you are replacing yours on a ford f-250 with 5.4 go with 15718 with the longer cord. And a 2003 f250 w/5.4L only has 2 not 4 like it shows. 
I wish there was a guide somewhere that shows you what cars these sunshades fit. I bought this one (Super Jumbo) for my Toyota Camry, hoping it would fit. Well, it did not fit. I had to return it, and order the regular Jumbo sunshade. The regular Jumbo sunshade fits the windshield like a glove. Quality is good, and it folds up to about 14&#34;. So, if you have a 2007-2013 Toyota Camry, DO NOT BUY THIS ONE!!! Order the regular Jumbo size.Amazon, can you please look into getting some sort of reference guide that will show customers the correct vehicle application? This would make buying this product a whole lot easier.CPS Looks and fits the same for a 2000 Toyota Sienna van. I ordered extra so I will not be without any at a later date. just  recived  these  prefect  fit would  tell any one in of these  to buy  these you  wont  besorry  you did 
Our new 5th wheel came with the cable pull valves.  They stink!  This way at least I can make sure the tank is empty before I pull off the sewer hose.  Easy to put on.  I especially like the way you can rotate it to whatever direction you need it to be. I got it quickly it looks good can not wait to use it as soon as I can go out side . This filter is used in my 2011 Prius and probably a lot more cars.  Easy to replace and a lot cheaper than having the dealer do it.  Just empty the lower glove box. Remove the rubber stopper cable on the right hand side of the glove box.  Then push in the rear sides of the glove box.  Once release you can remove the glove box.  There is a horizonally mounted cover that you remove and the filter is right behind that cover.  You can see all this on Youtube.  Once you do it its easy and good to get the old filter out and insert a new one.  Then reverse the process to get the glove box back in place. 
These are great, but they didn't come with a bag.  TheTri-Lynx 00015 Lynx Leveler for RV Leveling Block with Nylon Storage Case, (Pack of 10)comes with a very nice bag that would actually work well for these wheel chocks.  It would be nice if they had included that or another bag for these (that would have earned the product 5 stars). I required an ammonia-free window cleaner for my tinted windows. This does the job quite nicely. It isn't how well it does, rather how safely it does it. The Tender Jr. does not come with a cigarette adapter so I cut this in half to make two. I purchased 2 lighter plugs for a buck each from China&#8230; with free shipping&#8230; and they are working fine. These aren&#8217;t an exact match with the Tender cables but they fit together OK and are easy to determine polarity with the wire colors. You can also just use this as an extension cord for your Tender. The description states a length of 12-inches&#8230; but it&#8217;s actually 14-inches tip-to-tip on the connectors. Nice item for the price and it&#8217;s made in Mexico.

They are large enough to see from a distance to keep things on the level 
How can one really rate it, as it is used for protection and no idae how long it should last, yet is was as listed so I give it the benifit ogf the doubt... I was suprised how well and how easy they worked even on an extended van.  It saves wear and tear on the shoulders. I probably should compare it to another to see how accurate it is, but I really like how easy it is to use and turns off and on by itself. 
I bought this to clean the brake dust that accumulates quickly on my wheels and takes forever to clean the old fashioned way with a spray cleaner and towels. I have BBS style wheels with about 16 splines and a ton of small hard to reach crevices. They take me about 45 minutes to clean by hand. With this wand cleaner, I can do them in about 10-15 minutes. It is very soft and well covered so the hard plastic rod doesn't poke through and scratch the wheel. I keep a towel handy to wipe the brake dust off the wand after each wheel since it builds up quickly. With a little care, I got it into all the small hard-to-reach crevices and cleaned them. I am very pleased with the product and it saves me a ton of time. The wheels still need a full cleaning once in awhile, but this does the trick most of the time. As others indicate it's light plastic having easy-to-break plastic scissor arms so I've handled mine gently; has &lt;20 uses and still folds for space-saving stowage as designed.Like Worst: I have difficulty keeping Support upright; it's frustrating to set up without it toppling over.Many times (99%) after I've accessed secure setup (with big rocks or other helping keep it upright) I'll find it toppled over due to chute heft, expansion etc, a recurrent frustrating issue.Yeah, now while thinking about it, less I like ... I'd not buy again; will search for one different/sturdy when this one expires.Anyway, I keep chute short and steep, it helps.  I keep grey and black dump valve closed until tanks partially full, then drain by pulling black (poop) valve release first allowing it to drain then pull grey (sinks & showers) valve release; recommend freshwater rinse (before RV storage) if equipped.3 Stars for Price, 3 Stars Other, perhaps fair.Kyle I was very optimist about this product to help avoiding the stabalizers to sink in the grass, this past weekend I used for the first time in the grass, it rained and it sank deep and when I pulled the stabilizers up, and removed the pads they were bent, they do not hold their flat struture in a "soft" grass, if you do grass camping with motorhome that will not work, I am thinking I will still need a piece of 2x6 under the pad. 
How can one really rate it, as it is used for protection and no idae how long it should last, yet is was as listed so I give it the benifit ogf the doubt... This is a good fit for my motorcycle (PC800). The stitching seems to be coming loose but there are some decent winds out here so I am taking it with a grain of salt. Time will tell how long it lasts and if it doesn't hold up I will update this. Rated the best &#34;value&#34; filter on the market by independent testers that tested each filter on the market by using them and then cutting the filters open to see how they held up under actual use.  They then rated the filters on how well they fared and also how well they were made. 
would recommend getting a  size  smaller than  what the  &#34;sizing chart&#34; recommends  as  I  measure aroun my leg  as  recommended  and  the chaps  were  one size too large.. otherwise they are  awesome  quality and build The 2 x 2 Inch mirrors are a good fit for 2006 Honda Pilot. I had to order via Amazon since I couldn't find these anywhere - it appears local auto stores only carry the 3 x 3 inch size. These little blind spot mirrors are a must buy item - they cover the blind spots on either side of the vehicle very well. The meter has all the functions you could ask for a multimeter in a compact size.  The digits are large for the size of the meter, so it's easily readable by middle aged eyes. 
These are a good accessory to have because the clips are decent quality and the varied colors are helpful in keeping track of all the wires. please note these are not white - but beige... other than that they are standard rv baggage catches These are light duty jumpers but will work for occasional use. There are times when the voltmeter needs to be connected and you cannot hold the leads. These are fine for that. 
This is designed to work with the Valterra bayonet fitting on your Gray or Black water dump valve and it does just that... This fits in the windshield absolutely perfectly.  It is *exactly* the same size as the windshield opening, so it sits flush against the glass and stays on without using the visors to hold it.  Rolls up and has a velcro strap to keep it closed.  Very effective in the AZ summer. Really like the way it looks on my black 2 door JK. Fit was right on spot. It doesn't deflect everything but really cut down on the layer of bugs on my windshield. 
I bought this wheel chock to prevent my truck from slipping down an icy roadway during freezing weather at my mountain cabin.  I have to park on the road above my cabin during inclement weather because my driveway is too iced up to drive on.  This roadway has an incline and in the past,  my truck slid backwards on the ice after putting the truck in park and setting the parking brake.  I put this wheel chock behind the rear tire and it keeps my truck from sliding on the ice.  The nice thing about the strap on the wheel is the wheel chock usually freezes to the road during the night and I can pull it loose when I need to remove the chock.This chock is expensive, but worth the extra expense and I am going to order another one so both wheels are chocked this stuff is amazing, works perfectly, Gas stays very functional all winter, in the boat, Lawn mower, and i use it in the snow blower over the summer.  fantastico I will be using this  a lot this winter since I live in a cold climate (Minnesota). I do spend my time ice fishing and snowmobiling in the winter. This will help protect my face from the cold wind. Good buy! 
because, I have not used these yet.  I know they will be quite wonderful when I do need to use them A must have item, but use care as this can break (and still be usable).I would not be without one. I got it quickly it looks good can not wait to use it as soon as I can go out side . 
These are great blades made by Anco.  They are beam style blades that hug your windshield.  They leave a streak free shine and are great in the rain.  They are easy to install and work great.  I can say these are comparable to the Bosch brand blades, and would recommend these highly.  5 stars. My vehicle: 2004 Honda (Acura) TL 6-SPD J32A VTEC.The originals were made in the USA but these are made in Japan by NGK, or Nippon Touki (Japan Porcelain).  Iridium-tipped plugs are generally used on reciprocating powerplant-equipped airplanes.  Incidentally, Iridium/Platinum plugs are generally pre-gapped at factory and do not need re-gapping (some exceptions apply).  If re-gapped incorrectly, the tip would be damaged. these are very nice and flexible the straps are firmly connected.  I foresee many years of service from these covers 
I will be using this  a lot this winter since I live in a cold climate (Minnesota). I do spend my time ice fishing and snowmobiling in the winter. This will help protect my face from the cold wind. Good buy! I bought these so I could have extra, whats in the truck sometime break because of weather very hot or freezing cold when they are old. Summer heat car cool get for car it be good make A/C work better no more sad hot dash or hot wheel yay. 
because, I have not used these yet.  I know they will be quite wonderful when I do need to use them I am reading lots of bad reviews on these pigtails.  What worries me the most is some seem to be shipping with a different thread type and people are stripping them trying to make them work.  Why the heck can't these be standardized?  I've also read that some come with different sizes of NPT as well as different thread types.  It seems that what is listed is not always what you order, and on top of that, someone like me, who does not know how to recognize the different thread types and sizes won't even know if I received the correct part or the wrong part.I recommend you double check your part number on the hose before installing them to avoid stripping your regulator.I thought, why not use quick connect hoses to connect my regulator to my appliance.  It seems these mate up nice to other quick connects--but only if made by CAMCO, and then these quick connect fittings don't mate up easily to the other parts like regulators etc.  WTF?  I need still another adapter?  And some people tell me perhaps multiple adapters to make it all work?  I'm not going to use three different adapters to mate up a quick connect.  That means I have a huge lunking thing sticking out ready to be damaged, knocked out of place, that is sure to leak out all my expensive propane.Ok, so I called CAMCO.  I wanted to be sure I ordered the right part and spoke to two different people at CAMCO that blew me off.  It seems Camco parts don't necessarily fit each other.  And they don't sell adapters to make them fit. It would be great if they could provide some customer support and perhaps make up some custom hoses to help people make things work.I give this a 1 star because CAMCO's huge fail in helping me put together a system that will allow me to hook up external tanks to my RV.One star also, because they ship different types of hose fittings and buyers don't know what they are getting.Honestly, I'd like to order one of every one of their parts and analyze them.  I'm an engineer, and if I can't figure out what to order, based on conflicting information--reviews that report receiving different size fittings 1/4&#34; npt than specified 3/8&#34; npt, and a multitude of part numbers--and a need for adapters when a buyer should be able to buy everything he or she needs without an adapter---it all tells me CAMCO has not thought out how their products are used.Think about it, there are only so many way propane tanks, hoses and appliances are hooked up. I don't see any need for adapter other than those that attach to the tanks. Have not yet needed to use them, bought them for when I do need them. I am however, very impressed with the quality of the cables. The bag they came in is durable, handy, convenient & good quality. The price was outstanding for these cables. They are low profile to ensure that they do not rub on the wheel well. Only issue I had, was attempting to purchase another set of the rubber tensioner in case one breaks. Amazon did not seem to offer more than one size, which of course was not the size I needed. Most reviews caution you to have an extra, or you could find yourself in trouble if one side breaks. So if anyone knows where to buy extra tensioners, please let me know. 
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. Great Fit Exact replacement from OEM. Exact fit worked perfect . Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs. 
First, as with all of the Dupli-Color Metalcast paints, if you want the metalcast effect, you'll have to use the Dupli-Color Metalcast Ground Coat (MC100) on the surface before you apply the color or it will not come out right. The can says that it also comes out the same if you're painting directly onto chrome like surface but I have not tried this so I don't know. Now for this green. I'm more of a blue and purple guy for dark colors so only by my personal preference do I say that this green comes out just a tad light in color for me. Overall though, if you use the ground coat this comes out great with a nice metal sheen. I recommend this product. I work as a salesman at a car dealership so I had access to a lift.  If you have access, I strongly recommend using a lift vs. jack stands.  I was able to raise and lower my car so I was always painting the calipers from a comfortable standing height and could look at (and paint) the calipers from different angles to make sure I didn't miss anything.The included brush is downright awful -- plan on buying a decent tiny paintbrush for this purpose.The color is a glossy, fire engine red.  At the same time that I was doing this, I also PlastiDipped my rims a bright white (my Grand Am GT coupe is white as well.)  The contrast is striking!There's plenty of paint in this kit -- easily enough to do two sets of calipers.  I gave my remaining paint to the tech who helped me get my car on the lift and showed me how to use the air tools for my wheels. I got the yellow can to give my fog lights a vintage european look. I got the exact perfect color. Very pleased. The vinyl film you can buy is not the perfect amber color, but more of a cheap china lemon yellow. And the film reduces the light output by 20 % and is a pain to apply. Still, I needed 12 coats to get the tint I wanted. And you can only apply 5 coats in one hour. After that, according to the instructions, you must wait 7 days to add more coats. If your oven can go as low as 170, you can cure the paint for 90 minutes in the oven and then apply more coats. It doesn't  smell that bad. At the end, I got tired and tried to go heavy on the paint. Not good. It runs and you have to use 1500 grit sand paper to fix it. Not too bad, but still. After all that, I put 4 coats of Dupli-color clear wheel paint for extra protection. I know, they are just fogs and it's just a car. I guess I wanted memories of my youth when fog lighs were amber like they always should be. 
Can never go wrong with slime stuff.Don't put too much in a tire or you will be able to feel it moving around when you ride...a dirt bike...for instance. The floor liners fit perfectly and trap almost everything my shoes drag into my 2011 Jeep Rubicon 2 door.  I live on a dirt road, so even my leather sole dress shoes seem to drop dirt and gravel into my floor boards.  All I have to do is pull them out, shake them a little bit to remove gravel and dirt, or spray them with water if they get muddy.  I would highly recommend the Husky brand liners.  I think they have a lifetime warranty, too! If you have ever been stuck for 5 hours along side of the road waiting for the snow plow, you will begin to think about ways of preventing being stranded in the future.These chains fit the bill.They do what they are intended to.  Get you out of an emergency situation.HOW EASY ARE THEY TO PUT ON?There is not expertise required.  They are just cumbersome to get around a tire when it is freezing outside.  less so than regular chains I am told.HOW DURABLE ARE THEY?They will get you unstuck, and get you home if you have 10 miles to drive.  I wouldn't expect much more.  I have read they will break.  Don't expect to be driving on them all winter for the price.HOW DOES THE CAR DRIVE WITH THEM ON?Like a paint mixer.  Just put them on, put sugar and cr&egrave;me in your coffee and drive around the block.  After one block, you will have a nicely frothed cappuccino!Seriously.  Rough.  You don't want to drive any length with these on!HOW WELL DO THEY WORK?Even on an icy road with no snow, but a very thin sheet of ice(this is what myself and about 200 cars where stuck in) along country roads making it hard to make it through even the most mild turn at 10 miles per hour, they perform excellently to get you home.SUMMARY:For the money, buy them, and don't expect much but to get you out of a harry situation where you are stuck along the road.Getting home, rather than sitting alongside the road for 5 hours is worth 30 bucks!Mark :) 
Its a tire gauge that is pretty basic to use. You insert the metal pin into the tire tread gap and the rear part tells you the depth. Walk around the vehicle and check all the tires. If the front tires are worn more than the rear, its time to rotate the front tires to the rear. A little 1/2 ounce tube at the parts store was almost 5 bucks. this is great for exhaust manifold bolts and where heat and rust are a problem. Comes with an applicator brush attached to the cap. Can use on all bolts, never have to worry about breaking another bolt cause it welded itself to the thread. a must for auto enthusiasts. Since they made this non flammable and tire sensor safe it doesn't seal as good as it used to, but still a good product.  Shake it up real good, pull out the nail or metal sticking in the tire first if there is one.  This won't seal a tire well if you leave the nail in there.  I carry two cans per car because I had a hose assembly break. Or,  keep the nozzle hose assembly off the top of the can for a spare.  This will seal some bead leaks, but not with the wheel mounted on the car.  Take the wheel off. lay it flat with the leaking bead side down, and slowly lift and lower the tire to get the stuff to the bead rim contact area.  Good for galvanized trailer tires which always seem to leak there. 
Fits my Big Electra Glide, nice bag, well made double stiched good for the value and folds up small nice good bungies, nice compact cover can litteraly fit in from fork pouch, thin but protective and fit a Dyna Glide without windshield very well When I stepped up to a 34 foot fifth wheel trailer my standard chocks looked undersized against the 16&#34; trailer wheels.  These fit the bill.  Nice and strong. 
Very small cars only. SUV or truck or large car tires do not fit well between the ridges and deform the product. I fastened the mat down with 4 tapcon concrete screws, each 2 inches long, into my garage slab. The leading edge of the mat tore off the screws and folded up. The adhesive strip behind the mat was also useless. I would have had better result with a 2 x 4 piece of fir or pine and concrete screwing it to the garage slab. You also have to aim the car perfectly when you park it because the mat is only as wide as the tire. I can't return it because it's damaged from use due to faulty design. Wasted my money. Our 2012 Sonic only came with the anemic, cheapo small car sounding one note horn.  I initially bought the low note, thinking it was what the car needed, but that is the note/tone that came on the vehicle stock from GM.  The high note gives it the two tone sound, similar to what is on our larger Yukon SUV.  It does get noticed much more than a single note horn.Note: For those installing this on a Chevy Sonic, Cruze or Aveo, I was able to unbolt the driver's side front fender liner, starting on the forward side, and removed 4 screws up to the top of the wheel well.  Next i had to hold this fender liner back temporarily with a small block of wood and some string in one of the holes tied to the rim.  With an assistant honking the horn, I easily found the stock horn, spliced into the positive horn wire and used an existing small mounting hole, behind and below the existing horn mount location.  The supplied screw and ground wire worked perfectly.  If you use the 'piggyback' style wire splice that taps into an existing wire, be sure to put some clear silicon caulk over the splice ends after crimping, and then wrap some electrical tape around the snap cover to keep the connection dry and tightly secured. I bought this, set the code by turning the screw inside the front of the unit, and sprayed with a silicone lubricant.After a month on the front bumper, in the WA rain, there's no sign of rust and the inside tray is dry.The thumb-wheels turn easily and front face plate is tight.I can't find fault with this and it seems pretty secure.Since I can't predict when and where I might lock myself out of the truck, I just leave this on the front receiver by CURT where it fit's just fine with the smallest gasket.I'm very happy with this purchase. 
It is a high capacity suction gun. I used it to suction power steering fluid for my bmw335i in just one shot.  The only cons is the vinyl hose is a bit large and the remaining tiny fluid in the reservior can not be suctioned thoroughly.  Other than that, all is fine. No leaking at all. Do not forget to clear the vinyl hose and inside of the gun after use so that you can keep it longer. I bought this valve with high hopes of simplifying the regular draining of our 6-gal Atwood RV water heater, as removal of the standard nylon plug is a pain due to its location.  If you are looking to purchase this product under the same pretense, let me save you the time -- in my case, the better part of an afternoon.First, a quick explanation of how the valve works -- there are actually three components at play: 1) the large diameter plug that screws into the water heater, 2) a secondary plug that screws into the first, and 3) the actual valve which you open and close to drain the water.  I believe the intent of this design is to allow &#34;regular&#34; draining of the water heater with the last/smallest valve, while removal of the medium nut could be used perhaps at the end of the season to allow more sediment and debris to exit the tank quickly (due to the larger diameter).  Sidenote: opening the actual valve (the smallest component) drains the tank very, very slowly, and sometimes only at a trickle if you can't get air behind the water -- in my case, I had to open the pressure relief valve (in addition to all faucets) to produce an acceptable drain rate.While the valve piece never had any issues with leaking, the other components did.  I tried screwing in these nuts with and without Teflon tape, and at various depths.  No matter what the combination, there was always a small leak coming from either of these pieces.  There appeared to be no way to practically stop the leaking.  I also tried wrapping the nuts with an excess of Teflon tape (5+ wraps), to no avail.I gave up after about 2-3 hours of tinkering, returned the valve to Amazon, and ended up sticking with the standard nylon plug.  Hint: Sears sells a 15/16 offset wrench that is perfect for removing these plugs. Good quality R.V. water heater drain valve. Brass construction with a steel finger tip handle built in. A vital component when winterizing or just performing general maintenance. Teflon tape will seal threads upon install. Great replacement for older leaking or rusty valves. 
Went abroad for few months. I came back and everything fired up just like when I left. I think this stuff works. I never left without putting this stuff in so I don't know how things would have been if I didn't use this. Since everything works as it did when I left I would have to say that it does what it is supposed to do! I used it on a recent spark plug install and I guess it will work OK.  Well, it was a little messy going on and I didn't have any trouble with the install.  But, I really won't know how well it works until I remove the plugs - hopefully, years from now.  :-D  So, maybe Amazon will still be around by then and I can give an update when that happens.  Either it works or it don't - we'll see.  :-) I was a touch skeptical. But I can afford to throw it out if I don't like it.  Well I can say, I will NOT be throwing this out!  I was so impressed with how my cars looked when I was done that I had to ask my self. Why didn't I buy this sooner. And it is true. A little goes a long way. 
Mitt holds lots of water and both sides can be used as it is a flat style with cuff. These caps fit on top of the Tri Lynx levelers (Tri Lynx 00015 (10)  Lynx Leveler) or by themselves, for under stabilizer jacks or the hitch jack (if you have a light trailer).  They can also be used on top of the levelers, for under the tire(s) to level your RV.  I don't know how much weight they can bare, but they do well with my 3,400lb trailer for all of the uses described above. Its a tire gauge that is pretty basic to use. You insert the metal pin into the tire tread gap and the rear part tells you the depth. Walk around the vehicle and check all the tires. If the front tires are worn more than the rear, its time to rotate the front tires to the rear. 
I bought these to change the tires on my GSXR. These tire irons are bigger than they appear to be. The description has them listed as small tire irons but the ones I received are 18 inches long from tip to tip and about 11.67mm thick (see pic). The thickness and the fact that these irons have a handle means you can place maximum pressure on them and they won't bend. The end has an s tip that gets under the tire and makes it easy to lift the tire over the rim. These are well made and will last a long time. These are great blades made by Anco.  They are beam style blades that hug your windshield.  They leave a streak free shine and are great in the rain.  They are easy to install and work great.  I can say these are comparable to the Bosch brand blades, and would recommend these highly.  5 stars. These are great.  In my first manual tire change I used these and I'm thankfull I have them.  They are very strong, easy to use and grip.  The size and shape was perfect.  Overall pretty basic and not much more to say other than if you need tire spoons, these are a very good deal -- you won't go wrong.  Highly recommend these.

If you need precise tire tread depth measurements, this is the gadget for you. I like the zero calibration and the fact that you can change between metric, English and fractions.The precision is so good that you will think that the device is inconsistent if you take several measurements of the same tire unless you make those measurements in the exact same spot every time. Tires are not perfectly round and the tread depth varies around the tire because of braking at different tire positions over time. They are a bit slick and need to be sand blasted or something. I would not buy these for any Tire size 15 inch or smaller. Get a 4x4 , cut it, use it. 
I wish there was a guide somewhere that shows you what cars these sunshades fit. I bought this one (Super Jumbo) for my Toyota Camry, hoping it would fit. Well, it did not fit. I had to return it, and order the regular Jumbo sunshade. The regular Jumbo sunshade fits the windshield like a glove. Quality is good, and it folds up to about 14&#34;. So, if you have a 2007-2013 Toyota Camry, DO NOT BUY THIS ONE!!! Order the regular Jumbo size.Amazon, can you please look into getting some sort of reference guide that will show customers the correct vehicle application? This would make buying this product a whole lot easier.CPS This works great. It's sturdy and fit's nice and snug in a standard 5 gallon bucket. I will be ordering more of these in the future. I have been a fan of the Rain X blades, The latitude are new to me as I have always used the standard ones.  These work even better, they fit perfectly on my Audi that uses some new style clip, i was suprised that Rain X provided the additional clip to fit this application. 
Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars I have used these jack stands with my BMW E46 convertible and E90 sedan.  The stands are nicely finished, light weight, and durable.  For safety reasons, I will only use jack stands with a locking pin, and these fit the bill.

Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. Exactly what was offered, fit nicely, no major prep work, won't fade or crack, adjusts perfectly, easy removal and fits under seat in truck Great Fit 
I have an old 55 GMC with a Napco 4wd on 37 inches tires and it stands pretty high. Even getting to the oil dip stick is a challenge without a step.That tire step is really great, it unfolds and installs in 2 seconds over the tire. It fits my 37x12.5 (it won't work with a bigger tire) and is pretty stable.It comes with a nice pouch with handles to carry it with you everywhere you go. It folds nicely and can be stored under your seat. A really great item, and I am considering buying a 2nd one so that I can have one on each side when I am working in the engine bay of the truck. Armor All tire shine does a great job.  I use it on two vehicles tires, a Malibu and Chev 2500 Pickup.  Lasts a couple of weeks, unless it rains of course.  I get 3 to 4 all tire shines per can.  Recommend! I have a 2005 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon with 33&#34; tires that I just bought last year. I drive it around the 'burbs 99.999% of the time, so obviously I need a Hi-Lift X-Treme Jack and accessories to go with it the other 0.001% of the time.For my application, this works great. It's solid and looks cool. 
I purchased Accutire MS-4350B Setpoint Tire Gauge a few weeks agoto replace my Accutire MS-4021B which batteries went dead.It works fine and to date I have had no problems with it I used this stuff for years in my motorcycle tires and never had a flat in a Slime equipped tire.  I did have two flats (one front, one rear) on a couple of secondary m/c's I had, that did not have Slime in the tires.  That was when I used to change my own tires on the garage floor.  But I have a recent story.  Nowadays . . .Being older and less inclined to wrestle with tire changes myself, I now use a dealer shop to mount my replacement tires. I recently took my Yamaha in for the first rear tire change at 8000 miles.  I had Slime in the tube and the mechanic complained that he couldn't get it to balance and had to install a new clean tube.  OK.  Then . . .2 months and 600 miles later I walked out of a restaurant and there sat my bike on a flat rear tire.  It was a small rusty nail.  And I had not installed Slime in this new tire due to the mechanic caution about balancing.  I got it fixed, but here's my situation nowadays. . .I still am not using Slime pre-installed inside of my tubes. BUT - in my underseat storage compartment, I keep a new 8oz bottle of Slime and a compact 12v air compressor.  I'm going to try from ever again being stranded helpless with a flat.A final comment about running Slime full time, pre-installed.  The manufacturer does not seem to recommend that on highway speed vehicles, and describes Slime as a temporary repair method only.  OK, so that's what I'm doing now, plus preserving my proper tire balance.  However, in my younger more worry-free years I ran tens of thousands of motorcycle miles with Slime pre-installed in my motorcycle tires, and never noticed a balance problem.  I never had a flat either.I'd keep one in the tool kit. I've had and used this compressor for  about 6 months now. I use it to keep the tires properly  inflated on a Toyota Landcruiser, Honda Accord, and Toyota Highlander. The Landcruiser tires may be a little larger than this pump was intended for, but it tops them off with no issues. I  also purchased  the Roadpro 12V Battery Clip-On and Cigarette Lighter Adapter so I've never had any issues with blown fuses.For me, the convenience of never having to find a working tire inflation hose at a service station makes this item  worth the price. One note, I don't find that the tire pressure guage is accurate. You will want to have an accurate guage, preferably one that lets you bleed air from the tires (Joe's Racing makes an excellent one). 
I bought this because I was in need of one for my car.  It is simple to use and does the job for an inexpensive tire gauge.  You can use it to measure your current tire gauge as well as deflate your tire if you have too much air. These caps fit on top of the Tri Lynx levelers (Tri Lynx 00015 (10)  Lynx Leveler) or by themselves, for under stabilizer jacks or the hitch jack (if you have a light trailer).  They can also be used on top of the levelers, for under the tire(s) to level your RV.  I don't know how much weight they can bare, but they do well with my 3,400lb trailer for all of the uses described above. It's a leveler.  What more do you need to know really.  You can roll your trailer onto it to level it out,  Worked for me!  Just make sure to check weight of your load you plan on putting on it. 
Great wheel lock that is easy to activate and unlock.  It comes with 3 keys, one of which has a LED light on it.  The product also comes with a reminder cord that attaches to the handle bar as a reminder.  It does just what I was looking for. This just slides on the handle and lift bar to eliminate rattling while driving with a hi lift jack. It's cheap and easy, what more do you want? Great tool for clamping hard to reach radiator hose clamps.  Its multi-position locking mechanism will make sure to clamp and hold various sized clamps- unlike other pliers that can only hold in the fully close position. 
With so many vehicles, I needed to replace my 25 year old unit.  This uses dual power, so at home I can plug into AC; on the road the 12 volt plug in my car.  I like the auto shut off feature when pressure achieved. This is heay gauge,and heavy duty!I use this to connect up to my 1150 cca diehard marine battery.With the battery tender,Cigarette socket installed,I then plug in my ARB Cooler,load up and head out.With the pre installed 75a fuse it won't fail,never does! Solidly built adapter. Allows me to plug my trailer into the garage when using the lights, charging the batteries or cooling the fridge. A must have for the RVer.

I don't know how much weight they can bare, but they do well with my 3,400lb trailer for all of the uses described above. Two of thes pads, under my Camco RV jack stands, raise the stands to the proper heighth for my pop-up.  They don't slip or slide on hard or soft surfaces. Need one say more?  And, these can be locked in place using a small lock you put in the tightening head (lock not included).  Once in place between the wheels on a tandem axle trailer, there's no way the trailer will move.  Cool! 
I used these safety cables as a backup for the winch strap on the bow of our two personal watercraft. They are so easy to use I'm going to order more and use them to replace the safety chains on my trailers. This will save me a little time when hooking up the trailers because they simply snap onto the truck instead of having to thread the chain through and tighten up the chain link. Also they self retract so won't need to be wrapped around the trailer so they won't drag on the ground like chains.The materials and construction are good in my opinion. The price is quite reasonable too. This tail bag easily attaches to the motor cycle. 4 straps with a loop on one end and a quick connect on the other.  Also there is one strap with quick connects on each end and all are adjustable length. good bag for the price. It is a cheap steel receiver tow hook.  Nothing more.A retainer clip to keep the strap in the hook should have been included at the very least.  Otherwise any slack might make your tow strap pop out, or worse yet, stab your strap over the end of the hook and rip it.I have done a lot of pulling, vehicle recovery, and off-road driving.  I've seen every scary, unimaginable tow method.  And, I've seen people use things that were not designed for pulling like cables and chains.  Misuse of these items can seriously injure and kill people, as well as do major damage to vehicles.  Because, when you put thousands of pounds of stress on a tow line and suddenly it breaks or lets loose, it shoots straight back in the opposite direction and will go RIGHT THROUGH windshields, radiators, plastic, sheet metal, and BYSTANDERS.If you want something to keep in your trunk in case you ever get stuck in a ditch, or if you even THINK you're an off-roader gearing up for the trail, DON'T BUY THIS.Frame mounted clevis points are the safest bet.  But, if you don't have that luxury at least buy a receiver CLEVIS mount with a closed eye and a screw-pin clevis.Other safety advice from experts:Only use a soft nylon tow strap rated at least twice your vehicle's weight.Never use a strap with built-in hooks or metal eyelets.Never use chain.Never use wire rope cable.I knew the dangers when I bought it.  But I'm not using it for towing or emergency recovery.  And I know how to and not to use it. 
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. Exactly what was offered, fit nicely, no major prep work, won't fade or crack, adjusts perfectly, easy removal and fits under seat in truck The site recommended a large for my VTX1300C, it fits, it is snug, wont work with wind screen or saddle bags, but wont blow off in a stiff breeze 
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Perfect fit for rear window on my 2004 Ford Excursion Limited. Easy to install. No spotting seen or squeaking at all Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted.

This does not fit my wheels. It needs a hose to fit more stem configurations. The 100 is identical, except for the 0-60 it is 0-100, but states it has a 11" hose but it doesn't. I recommend a type with a hose for versatility. The 100 is nice but the 60 is fine for most applications. If you have a bike that needs over 60 than look for a 100. This is not for all applications. Also be careful not to drop this or you throw it away. I bought this product and you can't tell from the picture, but it has an extra 'ring' that keeps it attached to the hitch even when the plug is not in the hitch... when you're using it to tow or to hold a rack.  This is a great bargain for the money and seems to be a genuine Mopar part. Just as it says.  Easy to install, is good quality and functions just as it should.  To install, all that has to be done is to remove the four screws holding the fuel filler area finish ring in place.  The ring does not have to be removed.  Place the cover in place and use the provided screws to secure the cover.  That easy!

Didn't realize that this had a 3500LB capacity and 350 FT LBS for the tongue weight.  I'm using this on my travel trailer so I can take all our bicycles which all three bikes and bike rack make up a tongue weight of 180lbs.  A great buy I bought two sets / 4 total. I use them near the middle of the lifting range which puts the saddle about 18 to 19 inches high. This is perfect to get my truck off the ground and give me an inch or so of ground clearance to R&R; the tires and do other work underneath the vehicle.I don't need 6t worth of lift, but I like how these j/s have a wide lifting range. With these set for my range (as stated above), they are not teetering at the top of the range like others I've used in the past, but are comfortably in the middle. They are very stable and solid units.It would be helpful if the info stated the lifting range of the units, not just the tonnage they can support as a pair.Min. Lift Height (in.)14 29/32Max. Lift Height (in.)23 1/2 These things are rated 8,000lbs but that's for ( GVW ) so while it's correct technically in reality each item is rated by the label at 2,000lbs per each item and if you had 4 (they sell them in pairs), if you had 4 of them you could put 8,000lbs on them, technically and according to them.****I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO RELY ON USER REVIEWS TO GET THE INDIVIDUAL WEIGHT RATING!!!!***GVW is a very deceptive and dangerous way to market and label these products.  Consider this, on a truck, the majority of the weight is on the front two wheels while the rear wheels don't have as much weight - same is true on a front wheel vehicle.  This leads to situations where you could overextend the capacity of these products.I'd like a very clear rating: 2,000lbs, 4,000lbs, 6,000lbs for each stand or ramp on Amazon so that I know how much weight I can safely put on it similar to what is found on jacks....a jack is not labeled as 6,000lbs if it can lift a 6,000GVW vehicle, 6,000lbs means that the jack can lift 6,000lbs!After all, I'm planning to get under these things!!!!On items like this where someone's life very literally depends on the labeling ---  it would be really really really nice (and a legal requirement) that the specifications on Amazon very clearly stated both the operating weight, maximium weight, and crush (failure) weight per each ramp/stand versus this GVW rating which is deceptive and just plain dangerous.I have very literally found people working underneath 8,000lbs trucks without the wheels using jack stands sold as "2ton" when in reality each jack stand was only rated at 1ton or 2,000lbs.....their comment back, "this is a 2 ton stand and 8,000lbs GVW divided by 4 is 2,000lbs or 1ton, plenty of margin."  When in reality 6,000lbs are up front....3,000lb for each wheel  and each stand rated at only 2,000lbs....making their jack stand 150% overloaded! --- horrendously scary (all because marketing is so bad in this area).  Yes people should exercise care in using double protection and users should Always read their instructions and warning before putting their life on the line -- but for the love of God, there is a responsibility on the makers and marketers of these products to label them very clearly and in bold with the weight that EACH can hold and Amazon should post that weight for each item in BOLD Yellow or Orange wording with very clear warnings.Amazon and automotive sellers on Amazon need to get on the ball regarding the needs of auto ethusiasts and for the safety of the weekend mechanic who should not have to do complex math to figure out how much weight each item can hold!We REALLY need to get away from GVW, it's deceptive and dangerous!****I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO RELY ON USER REVIEWS TO GET THE INDIVIDUAL WEIGHT RATING!!!!*** 
If you are considering purchasing this product for various uses at home, such as tires (cars and bikes, etc), mattresses, sport balls, and almost anything that need inflation, this product is the answer.Two cons: you'll need an extension cord and the PSI dial is not digital so you'll need to guessimate the actual PSI or you can get a digital pressure gauge to accurately measure your PSI. First, you will need to buy the high tone also, or it will sound stupid. It is part #72102. I have put these pair on my last 4 cars. The low tone does have a habit of failing if it gets wet. This has happened twice to me. For some reason, the high tone works fine if it gets wet. Make sure you mount the low tone in a location where it will not get wet.The kit does not include a relay. You may want to install a relay, especially if your car is wired for one horn. The horns draw 4.5A each at 12V. This is usually within factory limits and most fuseboxes will have a 10A or larger relay built in the horn circuit. The kit does include 3 female blade connectors, a mounting bracket and nut, and a jumper wire (needed if your car is wired with one horn lead).And, they are very loud. Packaging declares 130db at 4 inches. I do not have a db meter, but I can assure you the horns will get the job done. The pair has a nice tone, and will rid your car of the little factory &#34;meep meep&#34; horns. If you need to change the filter on a 1984 Isuzu engine WITH THE SUPER FAT FILTER  and do not have this tool and somebody else installed the filter with more than per instructed hand tight you are without this tool in a world of hurt.Granted this too is hard to manipulate and the spring falls off  but it is cheap and it will work YOU NEED IT  NUFF SAID. 
It say's that it doesn't fit on my 04 Crown Vic but, it does :) Just to let people know! I don't know if it is just mine but the locking pin is hard to retract (unlock).  It is easy to put on, is bright yellow so its easy to see by both me and potential thieves.  But unlocking is difficult, the locking pin wants to stay in the locked position and not retract with the key.  Maybe just mine, I don't know.  I would have given it a 5 if it worked better. Can't say whether this item works well or not.  Don't care for it.  Hasn't helped with emptying the black water in the RV so don't really understand what it is supposed to do. 
Wow is this thing stout. I was afraid it might be a little cheap China made lock. I don't knkw where it was made, but it certainly appears to be built well. Hopefully no theif will test that. The case is noce as well. I'm very pleased. Typical PVC quality product designed to do a specific purpose.  Works as described.  You could make one if you wanted.  But for the price and free shipping why? Made in China poor quality item that does not befit the Robert Bosch brand at all.Not for winter for sure.The origin of the product should be stated at the product page.If I knew it were a MADE-IN-CHINA I would not have bought it. 
No more "nagging" to close the screen door! You could probably buy a spring at your local hardware store for about the same price, but the pre-determined install tension (distance to drill holes) and where to mount the spring(s) makes it well worth the $7. I followed the instructions for screw hole distance and only needed 1 spring. Both springs may pull the door past the latch at rest (without door swinging closed), but a normal entry/exit the single spring has enough to overcome the latch without slamming the door. In the past I have used coarsely threaded screws carefully place into the seal and a pair of &#34;lock pliers&#34; to pull the seal out. These are certainly a step up from my previous method. This simple tool seems to be well made. The hitch pin locks are wonderful.  High quality, durable, and weather proof.  But if I had to do it over, I might just buy the pin locks (Master Lock Key Alike Set with Receiver and Coupler Latch Locks, 2-Piece Set #2848DAT) without the coupler lock.  First of all, the coupler lock doesn't really deter someone from stealing your RV trailer if they are determined.  You can simply connect the chains to a vehicle and drive off or just cut the coupler lock off.  I use the claw for real security (Tire Claw XL Lock #491KA - ATV, Auto, Trailer Locks).  Therefore, the only thing the coupler lock does is deter the casual thief if you don't use the claw.  The ball is grey plastic with a steel inner, which should work well.  I find that when it's in place, it hangs down and looks kind of floppy.  I may just end up using the hitch pin locks and claw only and forget the coupler lock. 
Just as it says.  Easy to install, is good quality and functions just as it should.  To install, all that has to be done is to remove the four screws holding the fuel filler area finish ring in place.  The ring does not have to be removed.  Place the cover in place and use the provided screws to secure the cover.  That easy! fits my car perfectly, works perfectly, was easy to install. The best measure of a wiper blade is that it does what it is supposed to do, when it is supposed to do it. My unit did not come with any instructions.  The tool seems too complicated to be very useful, but does work. 
The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around! I should have gotten the Honda cap.  This fits OK, but the screws are not "captured" in the cap.  With the original cap,the screws cannot fall out.  Considering the position of the screws when mounting this, captured screws are an advantage. Very quick and easy mounting and really adds to the look of the rear of the Jeep.  These are metal and not a cheap plastic and mount with included screws into the existing lens cover screw holes. 
You cant find these oil  filters any were, Not Autozone, not Pepboys. not Napa,  I found them here on Amazon for $3.00 a piece so I bought 8 of them. Now I dont have to waist my time looking all over town for them, I have my own supply of them!!! these seem to be very good quality spreaders. I am going to buy another set to have on hand  in case i need them. Again, these guys are hard to do without.  They are doing the job!  I don't buy the 3-pack, I prefer to buy the individuals in quantities of 3 because, for some reason, I get free shipping on the individual ones, but not on the multi pack one.  So, it came out cheaper to buy them a la carte.  Go Figure! 
They do a dang good job but you have too order two I just assumed they were sold in pairs like socks ? Wrong I mean who buys just one wiper blade if they were made to fit a Ford super duty F350 I bought this, the fasteners and the screw covers for my 06 M3 and they fit and look good.  Maybe a little pricey having to purchase all the parts you need separately This is my second tool, the first one I had to modify the puller tang to work with chainsaw seals...i was going to buy the replacement tangs but they cost almost as much as the tool when you add in shipping so I just got a second one.  If you take your time and ensure the tang fits in the seal this tool is indispensable when replacing shaft type seals (camshaft, crankshaft etc).Love it. 
i bought this to replace my trusty c-clamp and it works nice and fast too but i think i might spring for the better model that looks like a caulking gun I needed a replacement for my 10 year old digital tire gauge, so I thought I'd find something that would really meet my needs.  Since I ride a motorcycle most of the time, and on long distant rides, tire pressure is something that if not done right will ruin your trip.I was going to get a backlit version, but saw this one.  Accessing my R1200RT rear tire's valve is a bit difficult with the panniers and double brake discs.  This looked like a good buy.Highlights1.  Seems accurate.  I tried several analog and digital gauges on my car, and this was spot on.  I tried it on my bike, and apparently, I need some air!2.  Battery appears to be replaceable, which was the issue with my trusty old one.3.  Handle grip is nice.4.  Huge numerals for those who have poor near vision.The not so highlights1.  It's plastic.  Sure, that makes it light and probably cheap to make, but I suspect that 90 bend is going to be a problem.  You might torque it a bit getting it off the valve stem, which might break it.  But it hasn't broken yet, but I'm concerned.2.  It's hard to read in the dark.  Make that next to impossible.  OK, I could have purchased another version, but I'm just mentioning it.3.  There is no audible beep when it captures the pressure.  But, it's something I'll just have to accept.Overall, for the price, it appears to be a very well designed gauge for a motorcyclist.  Interestingly, I tried it on my car, and the angle precluded me from using it with the numbers facing me.This gauge isn't perfect, but it's pretty nice.  I wish it were all metal, but we'll see if I mess it up.  It's now in my tank bag, always available for use. Finally, people know that I'm around.  The factory horn on motorcycles are so weak.  People rarely hear you and when they do, they don't pay attention.  With this horn you can stand up and be heard.  I just bought the black because its hidden anyway. No sense buying the fancy chrome, which is usually chromed plastic.  I would say that this horn is comparable to the Stebel Nautilus Compact.  I had that one on my Vulcan and the sound is pretty similar.  Great price for a great horn! 
Motion Pro Cable LuberThe latest version of this tool has TWO thumb screws.I purchased this tool because it was recommended as a basic tool for maintaining your motorcycle or any other vehicle/device that uses cables. Well, after talking to some experienced riders, they all exclaimed that lubricating the cable (clutch or throttle) is a good idea, but they generally have never done this in over 20-30 years. Looking at the latest motorcycles, the cables don't really allow you to lubricate them using this tool or any tool for that matter. On my Ducati, there are rubber boots that prevent you from injecting lube into the sheath assuming you can use the tool and reach the sheath. On my Ford, the throttle cable sheath isn't thick enough to form a tight seal with the Motion Pro tool. It almost seems like the OEMs don't want you to lubricate the cables. On top of it, modern cars and the latest motorcycles use drive-by-wire which is totally electronic where your throttle input (pedal or twist grip) is connected to a potentiometer that tells the computer your desired throttle angle/input, and it activates a stepper motor that opens/closes the throttle plates accordingly. So if you're interested in maintaining your new bike or car with this tool, you might want to reconsider buying the tool.If you have a vehicle that uses cables and has a sheath that is accessible and large enough to form a seal, this tool is very easy to use and well made. Just slide the cable through the slit, push the tool up against the sheath entrance, clamp down the screws, and insert your lubricant nozzle/tube into the open port. Then use rags to seal the tool and the exit of the cable sheath, and squirt away.Overall: 4/5 stars, the rubber seal could have been designed to accommodate really skinny cable sheaths. Newer bikes and cars don't need/can't use this tool. There are two horns, not one. One is 400Hz and the other one is 500Hz.PIAA | Automotive Sports Horn (400/500Hz) #85110The are exact fits on the mounts as the OEM horns and use the same bolts. A 1/4 inch drive ratchet and a 12mm socket is needed to remove and install the bolt. They came with grounding leads with ring spade lugs that mounted readily under the existing M6 bolts on the radiator supports. All you need is a 10mm socket.The two wiring harness leads are too short to connect the horns. Two wire tie mounts hold the harness to the aluminum bumper reinforcement. You can cut off the ties and use the OEM harness to connect the horns, but I chose not to.  I prefer NOT to cut off the OEM connector blocks.I made two pigtail extensions out of 18 gauge black primary wire, 5 inches long. One end needs a 1/4 inch wide exposed male quick disconnect. The other end needs an insulated female 1/4 inch quick disconnect terminal. Since I used 18 gauge wire, I used the red coded ones.The exposed male connector slides into the OEM horn connector perfectly. The female one clips easily onto the positive terminal of each horn.The horns how have a weather shield on the apertures.Best thing to my surprise is that they appear to be very high quality and Made in Japan.Also nice is that they need no modification to the horn relay or circuit. I installed this brake controller in a 1955 GMC pickup truck that I use for towing. Just follow the diagram for wiring and it just works like a breeze. I like the way you can adjust easily the voltage with the dial on the left and the mounts provided allows you to install it a convenient location under the dash (it works in any position).If you want to install this in a more modern truck without tapping directly into the wires, you will need additional adapters at extra cost. 
Nice little horn for my Harley. LOUD enough to get people to move when they pull out in front of you and decide to go slow, small enough to fit, and nice to look at.Got asked asked a bike meet just the other day "what is that" and he sure got a surprise when I pushed the button lol. This model is completely chrome to look at when installed,  unlike other types that a partially chromed.To use this on a motorcycle you will need to install the included relay for the main power to the horn to prevent damage to your wiring. If I needed to I would definitely buy this horn again, in the first week it has already scared two cagers out of my way that have cut me off by running red lights, who knows it may have even saved my life.I am glad I bought it, but unfortunately due to Amazon raising prices as I put items in my cart it will probably be my last purchase from them. I mean really, I put a $225 item in my cart but when I go to pay for it it goes UP $75? That is just insane. Think I might put some glue in the loop that holds the tubing.  Couple times now I've had the tubing come out and remaining in the awning channel with the holder in my hand.  I don't leave them sitting in the channel all the time as we have a sun screen to use in the day, so sliding them in and out creates problems with the tubing falling out - especially when it wasn't the last one to go in. This review needs to be prefaced with an important fact: I have no spare tire and don't have run flat tyres.I decided that I was sick of worrying about what I'd do if I got a puncture in a part of the country were 265/40R18's weren't common (these are for a Porsche, they're an extremely uncommon size).  I went on a bit of a tyre repair buying spree, buying this in addition to a giant bottle of slime goo and a more generic set of plugs.  My car did come with it's own tire goo, but I didn't want to rely on OEM tire goo as my only option.Well, I got a puncture last night that left my tire completely flat when I got back to my car this morning.  All of my previous punctures kept air just fine so I could get to the tire shop for a proper repair, but this one wouldn't hold air even with the screw still in the tire.I figured this would be just as good a time as any to try out this product, since the tire just didn't hold air at all.  Really easy to use, the instructions were simple and clear.  I highly recommend their suggestion of using water on the plugs, otherwise it catches on the tool.  I put the first plug in, and it was leaking air just as much as with the screw.  I put in a second plug and it let out just a little bit of air, but much less.  I thought I'd just leave it at that, but in the end I put a third plug in.  It was completely sealed up, and water doesn't bubble up on it.  That was about 6 hours ago, and I just checked and it's held the same pressure as when I filled it up at the gas station.  I took the wheel off the car because I was safely in a garage, but I could see doing this on the side of the road with the Porsche air compressor.This isn't an expensive or interesting product, but what I love about is that it gives me more confidence when driving my completely impractical car on road trips!  I'm buying a new set of tires (the puncture was on a nearly worn out set of tires), so I can't attest to long term reliability, but I can say that for punctures which leave the tire intact, this product can help you get to a place to fix your tires for real!  I don't know whether this is considered a long term fix or not, but I won't be using it for tires I plan on using on the freeway. 
I have a 1993 M35A3 with 6 Michelin 14.5 XLs and a spare.  The CTIS (central tire inflation system) had been disconnected, and the split wheel o-rings need to be replaced.  This means that I have 7 huge tires with slow leaks.  I have the truck in an apartment complex parking lot with no electricity for my big Makita 5hp compressor.  And my honda generator cant crank over the Makita.  I had a little red compressor from VIAR, which was good in the emergency I needed it for, but got so hot in inflating these tires that it melted the yellow hose.The 450P was hooked up to my yellow goodyear hose and Subaru Outback (running), and put to work right out of the box.  It took 5 of these tires from 15 lbs or less to 45 lbs in about 35 minutes.  When you have 13,000 lbs of truck, having tires that roll is critical, because even a wrecker can't move them with deflated tires.  The pump was hot, but the inflating pipe on the compressor runs through the padded handle, which allows you to pick it up when hot.  The gauge has a trigger and a  lever that holds fitting on to the tire valve, which is really handy.  Having a switch vs using the battery clamps to start saves on sparking.I was at a loss as to how I was going to get these tires inflated in remote situations with out a huge generator to run a huge compressor...so this continuous duty 12v pump was very timely.(for those of you who are military truck experts, I am aware the M35A3 has an on board compressor, but there is a blockage somewhere ahead of the 'glad hands.')  The M35A3 is about the largest truck (23,000 lbs gvw) you can drive in NC without a license , and has 7 really big tires to say grace over.  This is not a replacement for a functioning CTIS or a big compressor, but will get even the largest tires inflated and rolling. If you are considering purchasing this product for various uses at home, such as tires (cars and bikes, etc), mattresses, sport balls, and almost anything that need inflation, this product is the answer.Two cons: you'll need an extension cord and the PSI dial is not digital so you'll need to guessimate the actual PSI or you can get a digital pressure gauge to accurately measure your PSI. Two cars and motorcycle plus one in garage for my compressor refills.  Bought this one on faith because so many liked this Michelin.  Getting a good seal on valve most immportant and accuracy of course.  This one seals easiest.  That is the best feature.  Tenths of one PSI is also handy if measuring cold tire.  Bulk weight and size less handy if in glove compartment?  Lots of other things in there.I keep this one in garage.  For me with three vehicles and ten tires the pressure memory not helpful.  The light might be nice.  Weight and bulk in my XL hand feels perfect when pressing on tire valve.  That is what the weight is there for?#####  Please let me suggest something for those who get their oil changed at those "quickie" places.  Part of their service is to check you tire pressure.  That is VERY BAD FOR YOUR TIRES.  You have to drive there for the oil change.  Your tires likely warmed up.They decided tire pressure was too high and LET AIR OUT.  Finally noticed tire profile looked low.  Shocked to see almost ten pounds low when cold.  Damn!  That is damaging if driven on freeway for long miles.  Overheats tire and wears faster.Tire pressure should always be check when cold.  Yes it will go higher with driving.  That is taken into account when manufacturer or car manu. recommends pressure setting.  No matter how high when hot ALWAYS CHECK PRESSURE WHEN COLD.  Jiffee Lube and others have good intentions (I hope) BUT tell them NOT TO CHANGE THE TIRE PRESSURE with WARM OR HOT TIRES.  ............and that's the truth, LOL 
Tired of being charged WAY to much pretty much everywhere for a 5 min filter change? I got this for my 2008 prius and you can do the install yourself in under 5 min for almost nothing. Never pay $120 again at the dealer.Your CAF is located behind the glovebox. To get to it, you need to open your glovebox and let it sit open all the way. Empty out your glovebox. If you don't, you'll be cleaning up the contents of your glovebox from the floor when you're done replacing your CAF. Next step is to look on the right side and unhook the dampener. Next, squeeze the rear of the glovebox sides inwards to be able to let the glovebox swing all the way down.Looking inside, you'll see a tray with latches on both sides. Press those latches inwards and start sliding the tray out.When you put your new CAF into the tray, make sure you follow the arrow on the filter as the air is meant to flow through in one direction. The air flow is down. If you forget, the tray has an arrow on it also that says &#34;air flow&#34;.To finish the job, reverse the proceedures above. Slide the tray in, click into place, rotate the glovebox up and let it snap into place, replace the dampener bar, then close the glovebox. A bit tough to insert the key into the hole as the towing light outlet on the left is partly in the way.  It's manageable to lock and unlock, but you have to do it at a slight angle and/or wiggle it in.  The black makes it look hidden and matches nice. The springs do one thing only, they pull the screen door closed, they do not control closing speed or latch speed. I tried one spring at first and found that it was not enough to hold the door from remaining slightly open if it didn't latch. Two springs and the door actually follows you when entering, and provides quick closing motion from any position when exiting. Also be sure to install the springs in such a way that they do not drag across any part of the frame or door or you'll get a twanging boing with a buzz. The 9" dimension is perfect. I put lengths of straws on each to help quiet them. I like the interaction now because the door actually feels like it prefers to be closed without being overpowering. Not enough tension to close the outer door but who cares, it's the perfect solution to the annoying screen door. 
it works, but my only gripe is that the hardener should be double the size, as it takes 2x the amount to properly cure this stuff in my experience, which makes the difference between dirt hard and rock hard. This debate just goes on and on...i don't know which is better. I have RP running in my transfer case and Amsoil in my tranny. Can i tell a difference? NOPE! They both seem to have great specs on paper with Amsoil has a slight edge on the viscosity around 100C degree, other than that, they are pretty much the same. Both are synthetic.  The only difference is RP is actually purple in color and you can get it off of Amazon. Amsoil, you have to buy direct. My last bottle of wax was Mothers California Gold. To be honest I can't tell any difference between that and the NuFinish either in applying it or the end result. Both are great.

That's all it does.1. There are 2 pieces and no printed instructions - just the box where you can see how to assemble.2.  The 2 pieces fit together by grooves.  Slide and you can adjust by pulling/pushing to get it to fit on vent.3.  Magnets to hold this on vent.  The magnets aren't strong but - barely strong enough to hold on the ceiling.There's nothing good to look at with this deflector.  It kind of disappears since it's transparent plastic.If this will fit your vent, just get one.  See how you like it and you can order more later. handy. when you go to dump, connect the sewer hose to the dump and then hold the end under the cap. Slowly loosen the gardern hose cap. If either of your blade valves has leaked or been opened you will have some &#34;water&#34; here and you will catch it and drain it into your sewer hose instead of all over the ground in front of everyone at the dump station. Can also be used for backflushing if you're careful and use backflow preventer. 
These are a huge improvement over the original halogen bulbs in my car.  They are whiter, brighter, and shine farther than the yellowish originals.  It was definitely a noticable difference, and much needed for night driving in an area with a huge deer problem (S.E. Minn). This Red Line auto trans fluid made a huge difference on my BMW's tranny. Now I know why this is a little expensive. I could tell the difference it made in my limited slip differential . It was quieter and seemed smother . to soon to tell if it made a difference in mileage . Yes I would recommend it to a friend .Paul 
I've purchased a variety of scratch removing products. Many of them worked well but almost all of them left noticeable swirl scratches, sometimes worse than the original scratch I'm trying to remove, especially on high-gloss black paint and clear-coats. This product works like a charm with minimal swirl/scratch marks (but suggest you try it on an inconspicuous spot first). This product works and smells amazing, however only use this product if the paint is entirely clean, if not use Mothers Cleaner Wax instead as it cleans and protects in one step. Great product ! It has a soft smell, very use to apply and remove. The interior of my car is fantastic !!! 
After using Step 1 - Pure Polish (really a pre-wax cleaner), I went on to this Glaze/Sealer.  And boy does it make my car look REAL good!Although this polish won't cut harsh enough to remove swirl marks and scratches, it seems to "hide" swirl marks and make them less visible (possibly by smoothing out the microscopic edges?).  Add to the fact that it doubles as a glaze/sealer, and it fills up the swirl marks and scratches.  Scratches are still visible, but the edges are smoothed out and less visible from farther away.  Swirl marks are still visible, but only up close and takes a tiny bit more focusing to see them.  So, it doesn't cure scratches or swirl marks very well, but what does it do best?  Enhance the color!This glaze makes the paint "pop" and adds even MORE depth, revealing long lost shades in some paint colors (in my case, Mazda's Galaxy Grey Mica).  It brings out the color of the paint and makes you appreciate your car even more!  I feel like this glaze will be effective even on lighter colored cars (maybe not white...) since it seems that darker colors seem to get all the love when it comes to detailing. ;)Believe me, after you do this step, you'll be looking at your car from different angles trying to figure out how many different colors & shades you can find and how "deep" the paint looks.Well worth it. Not to remove scratches, but to conceal and and make look presentable. It works well and does what it is supposed to do. Great for light scratches. Harder to use on black cars, but with a little patience it works well. I used this to remove adhesive left on my hood after removing the clear vinyl paint protector that was worn out and looked like s***. It works ok to remove adhesive, but it's not the kind of thing where you just apply it and it comes off easily. It still takes a lot of rubbing and scrubbing. It's better than nothing, but it's also not that great.A few things to note about this product:1. It evaporates really quickly, so make sure you use it in a cool place, away from direct sunlight. Otherwise it will just evaporate really quickly and do nothing.2. It will haze up plastics, I accidentally got some on my head lights and side mirrors and it damaged the finish. I was able to correct the damage, but just be mindful of this.

This product works like a charm with minimal swirl/scratch marks (but suggest you try it on an inconspicuous spot first). removes fine scratches, not anything deep into the paint.  But gets out minor scrapes and scratches.  Put a coat of wax on the area after using this product and it will shine beautifully. Used this on a black Dodge Charger with clear coat and the sparkly paint.It did a good job of removing finger nail marks under the door handles and minor scratches where things were dragged over the back bumper to put them in the trunk.It did not harm the clear coat.I would buy this again. 
Does what it says it does......looks great ! It does what it is supposed to and suds up. Great product that looks cool and has a great fit to my valve stems, good quality metal with a nice rubber seal at the bottom to keep dirt and grime from getting into my valve stems. 
I required an ammonia-free window cleaner for my tinted windows. This does the job quite nicely. It isn't how well it does, rather how safely it does it. Living in Central Texas is doesn't rain a lot but when it does you'll be glad you used this product.  It also works well when you need to clean your windows with the automatic glass cleaner featuere that comes with most modern cars.I suggest using a decent micro-fiber towel when using and of course cleaning the glass before you apply Rain-X.  Also, the 16oz bottle will last a very long time. This blade works great however you need to know a few things.  The ice will destroy it over time if you try and run this + windshield washer fluid in the winter on an uncleared windshield.  If you at using this in the rain/show though it will work great.  Another thing is that you can't use rain-x with this it will cause smearing. 
I've used this product many times in the past but each time I did it was the small bottle included with the filter that I used. This stuff is exactly the same as the smaller bottle and therefore works the same, which is to say very well. You spray it on the filter, let it sit for 10 minutes or so and rinse with water. There are two benefits to the larger bottle. First is that it is more economical. I have four vehicles with cotton oiled air filters and this bottle should last a fairly long time. Also, it is much easier to spray into the filter than with the smaller bottle. I also feel because it is easier to spray and direct you will use a little less cleaner your filter which should make it an even better value yet. I've done new spark plugs three times now on our vehicles and the anti-seize comes in handy. I've also used it to lubricate the threads on a basic strut compressor.A 4oz bottle would have been fine. This 8oz bottle will last my lifetime.Just mix it before each use because you get separation in the lubricant (similar to natural peanut butter). I saw an improvement in performance and sluggishness in my vehicle. If you've never used it and have high mileage, 2 applications are required. Also, it's important to first pour this and THEN the fuel. Ensure your tank holds at least 18 gallon, if you're using the 20 oz. or else go for the 12 oz. bottle. I would not recommend any additives other than this. These are really good and most importantly, don't cause any harm to the engine. 
Works excellent! Get the Aerosol over the liquid if you have the pod style filter or flat corrugated style for sure. It spays nice and even. I have used them both, the spray, and the liquid and the spray is the way to go for these. If you do have the older all foam style filters then get the liquid (squirt/pour kit or bottle) it will last you longer. I use the applicators for more then waxing cars. They are also good for staining wood. The fome applicators work ok, but don't lay wax evenly when waxing paint. I wet the applicator and ring out the extra water. Just making the applicator damp. Apply the wax to the applicator, fold the applicator in half so the wax spreds and apply to the paint. Same way as the movie.... wax on, wax off....lol I've tried a number of wax products, but Turtle Wax Ice Liquid Polish is the one I plan to stick with.Turtle Wax Ice has a number of similarities toLiquid Glass LG-100 Ultimate Auto Polish/Finish, the previous product I tested. Both are primarily synthetic glazes, exceptionally durable and water-repellant. Both products can be applied to any part of the car, even in the sun, and are easy to buff off. However, the differences between the two all stack up in favor of Turtle Wax Ice.Turtle Wax Ice is a relatively thin, clear liquid. It's extremely easy to apply sparingly and evenly. The product comes with a foam applicator that works very well for the purpose, as well as a small microfiber cloth for buffing. In contrast, Liquid Glass is a fairly thick, opaque liquid that's harder to dispense and more difficult to spread thinly and evenly on your car. The tendency is to apply more than necessary, plus it costs more. I'm finding Turtle Wax Ice to be much more economical and even easier to use than Liquid Glass.Probably the biggest issue I had with Liquid Glass was in the area of appearance. Even with more than one coat, I didn't feel it produced a deep-looking shine on my black car. Happily, Turtle Wax Ice helps decrease the appearance of swirl marks and produces an overall better-looking shine.Turtle Wax Ice Liquid Polish will save you money, time and effort by being incredibly easy to use and lasting a very long time. It will give your car a great shine and help keep it clean by shedding water and dirt, especially in bad weather. You can use it any time on any part of your car. For me, that's an ideal combination of qualities. 
used it on my 1994 f150 2wd for the rear end cover. Sealed it without any issues! Did not seem to work well when i tried to use it on the plastic center cap though It's a great product, however, it would not fit my Honda Shadow VT750 disc brake.It supposedly has 10mm holes in the disc brake, but for some reason the pin just won't fit!Otherwise it looks like a good product!I've used the 5mm pin for my scooters; however my motorcycle now has to do without lock. Does what it supposed to do,Fits most of my scooters.Does not fit a Honda Shadow 750's disc brake, because the disc is too wide.One star less, because the mechanism to mount the pouch to the handlebars is very weak, and impractical (I can't install it on handlebars of scooters because they have the handlebars covered with plastic, and can't install it on the handlebars of my motorcycle, because the hand grips and throttle are too wide, so it does not fit; the pouch also does not have a locking mechanism, so it's kind of moot to try to mount it somewhere).Otherwise, a great purchase! 
This product is a must have for anyone driving. Not only does it make it safer for highway driving. Especially when occasionally rain drops are the beyond normal and make it difficult and unsafe to drive.One tip this product works well on highway driving during city however it does work but not as well. During highway driving you can actually see the rain "peel away" from your windshield. WOOOSH!!! These look striking similar to the Bosch Clear advantage wipers, springy curved blade that hugs your windows. I did have a bit of trouble getting them on, for my car I had to take off the pre installed adapter on the Anco Contour wiper but after that it fits well and does a good job at clearing the window. Time will tell on their longevity. During the first week the ANCO wiper was on the drivers side of my outdoor-only car, we had 80+ degree weather, rain, sleet & snow.  The ANCO wiper started leaving a small eye-level streak after 4 days. The streak is faint, but definitely there, and, annoyingly, right at eye level.My passenger side wiper,ACDelco 22ACD Clear Vision Wiper Blade with Wear Indicator - 22" (Pack of 1), has been on my car since the beginning of the year and has been through multiple snow storms and freezing temperatures. The AC Delco wiper continues to be streak-free.I am going to put the drivers side ACDelco wiper back on my car. It has a higher profile arm, but it does a great job. 
THE HOPKINS SUB ZERO17511 ALL SEASON WINDSHIELD SCREEN  70&#34;X 29&#34; IS EXCELLENT IN PROTECTING YOUR WINDSHIELD FROM SNOW & SCRATCHES IN SUBZERO TEMPERATURES.I WOULD RECCOMEND IT TO EVERYONE TO PROTECT THEIR CAR WINDSHIELD IN THE WINTER. keep my bike outside for a couple of days in a row during the summer, this has protected my f4i from all weather including a hurricane(could not drive through it) Fits great and does not blow off I love it. Can also use to leave vehicle outside so the BatteryMinder ( Tender ) stays dry in the garage, if it rains outside. A must have for me. I want to protect this wonderful charger and keep it on the shelf, not under the hood in a hot engine bay. 
Very nice addition to my car. I bolted it directly to the inside of my driver's side door so it's easily found. This device attaches securely to the tow vehicle, but at a cost.They are cumbersome to attach and detach, with several moving parts and the potential to scratch the tow vehicle paint during either process if you don't have three hands available.To attain the secure vibration free fit, you must crank down on the ratcheted web strap hard enough to deform the door where it attaches to the window channel. It also deforms the rubber window seal.Foam pads protect the door somewhat where the bracket would otherwise rub on the body, but if the area isn't meticulously clean beforehand I can see where it would dull the paint over time.Because of the metal claw part that fits into the window channel, raising and lowering the window caused a screeching sound on my driver's side window.Finally, when they are detached from the door, they make for a very bulky awkward device that doesn't store conveniently or compactly in the vehicle.I'm sending them back. Received within 3 days. Saw Mythbusters do a test of these LifeHammers and they worked quite well cutting through the seatbealt and any of the windows EXCEPT the WINDSHIELD. Commit that to memory! In a emergency situation it will not easily crack or break the windshield, side and rear glass only. Mine is getting mounted in clear sight and access from the front seat, right in the middle of the rear seat benches so as to be easily grabbed by all! I have had experience with a stuck seat belt and they are a bitch to cut through with a semi-sharp pockt knife. 
I use a lot of Mothers products but this glass cleaners is the worse. It leave streaks all over the glass. Also, when used on the inside of the glass it fogs up the glass. At night the glass fogs up so bad it becomes dangerous. I've tried using a Microfiber and Terry cloth towel. I've switched back to straight water to clean the glass. Invisible glass is an awesome glass cleaner!! We first bought it for cleaning the windows on our cars but have since began to use it for any glass. We use it to clean our mirrors, glass coffee tables, interior windows and more. It truly does make the glass INVISIBLE. This works really well for cleaning the windows on your car between washes or right after washing to make sure that the windows are streak free.We highly recommend Invisible Glass and will be buying more soon. I used this wax on my Platinum Gray VW and the surface had a near perfect mirror reflection.  I will continue to use this wax 
This was my first time using Bosch for wiper blades. I have used Michelin, Rain X and others, but this was the simplest install. I've not had rain yet since the install, but from using washer fluid there were no streaks, and quite sliding. Very good first impression. I've had my car for almost 7 years and in that time I've replaced my front wipers at least once a year.  When I thought about the last time I replaced my rear wiper, I realized I hadn't...ever.  When I went to remove it to replace it with theANCO Contour Wiper Blade, it practically fell apart in my hand.  It was definitely past it's useful life and ready for retirement. The ANCO blade was easy to install, it just snapped on and because I live in the Pacific Northwest it didn't take long for some rain to appear for me to test it out.  The blade hugs the window and didn't leave streaks or miss any areas. It also glided smooth and even when the rain let up it didn't squeal on the dry surface.  Overall I'm pleased with the performance of this wiper and the price is very competitive. I use this in my mower for winter, and it seems to do a very good job. The mower always starts on the first pull in the spring, which didn't used to happen before I started using STA-BIL. 
Based upon condition of your wheels, the cleaner does require some elbow scrubbing but does a descent job. Hope this helps. It does exactly what it's supposed to do. No problems whatsoever. Does what it says it does......looks great ! 
I wish there was a guide somewhere that shows you what cars these sunshades fit. I bought this one (Super Jumbo) for my Toyota Camry, hoping it would fit. Well, it did not fit. I had to return it, and order the regular Jumbo sunshade. The regular Jumbo sunshade fits the windshield like a glove. Quality is good, and it folds up to about 14&#34;. So, if you have a 2007-2013 Toyota Camry, DO NOT BUY THIS ONE!!! Order the regular Jumbo size.Amazon, can you please look into getting some sort of reference guide that will show customers the correct vehicle application? This would make buying this product a whole lot easier.CPS These are a must have for any Jeep Wrangler owner.  It would be nice if this was a standard item installed on the Wrangler, but alas I am glad that I found them on here!  I ordered them for my 2011 & got my buddy the same for his 2012. I was asked to rewrite my review for some strange reason. I can only assume it was because the person approving my review didn't understand the product or the review.&#34;These work great for the backseat riders. It assists them in climbing up into my 2012 Wrangler. Arrived on time and adequately packaged.&#34;This review is for Rear Seat Grab Handles... their purpose is to give the backseat passengers something to &#34;grab&#34; onto. They are made for Jeep Wranglers. They fit the headrests of a 2012 Jeep Wrangler based on my personal experience with MY 2012 Jeep Wrangler. They arrived on time and weren't all jacked-up, so I can only assume that the packaging was adequate. 
I can't reach my travel trailer tires from the rear of my SUV with my air pump without this extension cord.  It's a good quality product and a smart investment. Use these in trailer tires, car tires, truck tires, ANY tires-these have saved me several times on the road, pull the nail, install one or 2 of these, reinflate with a small portable (or my nitrogen tank if I'm in the service truck), back on the road. Accutire MS-5550 is perfect to fit in the trunk of a car/van for those times when an air compressor is needed.  It has the standard adaptors for sports balls, air mattress inflatables etc, and the standard locking valve stem connector.  This works well on bikes and the inflatables.  Car tires take more time to inflate or get up to pressure.  Power for this little compressor comes from the 12 volt outlet in the car/van.  There is good length on the power cord and depending where the 12 volt outlet is on your vehicle it will reach to the car's tires.  Light weight and easy to use make this ideal for carrying around.  The problem with this is that on flat surfaces the compressor doesn't stand still when started.  It will walk around. Gauges are small and hard to read and there didn't seem to be a light for night time reading.  This is basically something to add to the traveling safety kit or to have on hand for those emergency bike tire inflating times.  Made of plastic that feels cheap.  I'm betting this would not take much of a drop to break.  With so many better compressors out on the market today, I can only moderately recommend this one.  It will work but there are better ones, Black & Decker comes to mind, and not for that much more money. 
I just got a 99 XJ cherokee and the lift-gate struts worked fine in warm weather where I bought it, but when I got it home to the mountains they stopped working in the cold. I am spoiled by the nice struts on my 96 XJ, so I bought a set of the Strongarm struts here on Amazon due to many positive reviews here and in Cherokeeforum.com. I put these on the Jeep in about 20 minutes and all it took was a small flat-head screwdriver and a 10mm socket. It was way easier than I expected! I used an adjustable backcountry ski pole to hold the hatch up while I did the work and it worked just fine. The hatch now goes up and stays up all by itself and works perfectly so I'm extremely satisfied with the fit and function as well as the sweet deal for a pair of new ones here on amazon. I have a 2005 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon with 33&#34; tires that I just bought last year. I drive it around the 'burbs 99.999% of the time, so obviously I need a Hi-Lift X-Treme Jack and accessories to go with it the other 0.001% of the time.For my application, this works great. It's solid and looks cool. I purchased this back in 1992 for my Oldsmobile and have used it on every car since: Accord, Civic, Integra, GTI, 240SX, 200SX, Maxima, Sentra and I could go on... You name it and it works. If you have a super wide filter or really tight space where the ratchet attaches, it may not be ideal. In my opinion, it's worked on 95% of the vehicles I've owned and this tool is awesome! 
I purchased this to be able to attach a high-end hydraulic assisted bike rake on the back of my Jeeps (JKs) with the rear tire still on.  It fit perfectly and teamed with the Bolt Lock BLT7018448 5/8'' Receiver Lock (Keyed specifically for your line of vehicle) it can be kept in the Jeep and my daughter doesn't need anything but her car key.The extender is exactly as advertised, well made, fit perfectly and does eactly what it is inteded for. I would install this on your Jeep as soon as you purchase the vehicle.  They're very easy to install and protect you from scratches that could lead to rust.  The guards fit perfectly on my 2011 Jeep Rubicon 2 door. Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. 
Installed on my 2006 Rubicon Unlimited. It looks good. It installed cleanly with the supplied hardware and wrench. I like the type of key and the lock opperates smoothly. I feel better knowing it is there to protect my vehicle from gas theft or tampering. I purchased this belt for my 2003 Chevy Tahoe. I had no idea Chevy would put 2 serpentines on a newer generation vehicle. This smaller belt fits the A/C system only. It works like a champ and fits perfectly. I would recommend the Gatorback belts to EVERYONE! As an installation side note, you have to remove the air intake and larger serpentine to get to this "bottom of the motor" mounted unit.... way to engineer that one GM! Installed easily and is working fine so far. The kit came with a rubber O ring type gasket which my old cap did not have. Takes a bit of doing to get this gasket positioned to stay in place for an air tight fit but I managed it. The cap could definitely be installed without it but thought I'd give it a try since it was included. I could swear I'm hearing less noise out of my engine with the gasket installed. In any case, all is well that fits well. :-)Installed on a '99 Honda Civic LX, 4 door sedan. 
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. These will not fit a 2014 Jeep Sahara Unlimited just in case anybody wanted to know.If by chance if you have a 2014 JKU you need a an oil filter. That number is a MOPAR 349.Our local Napa store could not bring up a part number for a new Jeep? I put these in my '03 TJ Jeep Wrangler.  They fit perfect and work exactly as you'd expect they should.  I installed a set of 55w HIDs in them and the light output is tremendous. 
This is just what I was looking for,  perfect size for the spare on my 90 4runner.  Looped it through the spaces in the wheel and locked in the back.  Nice for the added security. I purchased this to be able to attach a high-end hydraulic assisted bike rake on the back of my Jeeps (JKs) with the rear tire still on.  It fit perfectly and teamed with the Bolt Lock BLT7018448 5/8'' Receiver Lock (Keyed specifically for your line of vehicle) it can be kept in the Jeep and my daughter doesn't need anything but her car key.The extender is exactly as advertised, well made, fit perfectly and does eactly what it is inteded for. Bought two of these for my 2003 Grand Cherokee Limited.  One fit well but the other was longer.  I couldn't compress the piston enough to fit it, and trying to screw it in ended up snapping the metal, making it useless.  I put the stock lift support back in and now I have one new and one old.  It opens better but still not very good. 
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. It a belt... it fits, it hold and it rotates. There is no noise coming from it.Happy with the fit and performance. 
Work's great for my trailer. I bought this to do the brakes on my Porsche and it does not working very well it's too fat to fit in the space. Very sticky stuff that will stay where you want it.  It's also very slippery, so should work fine for any motor work you have. 
bought this for my 2004 honda crv.  fit perfectly and cleared the code.  easy to do just give the threads some wd40 bought this to take the o2 sensor off my 2004 honda crv.  worked great.  long enough and fit like a glove. Exactly what was offered, fit nicely, no major prep work, won't fade or crack, adjusts perfectly, easy removal and fits under seat in truck 
stellar product for polishing, cleaning and keeping the bike looking great. She works on the engine, paint, fiberglass, plastic, chrome and anything else on the bike. DO BE CAREFUL SPRAYING ON THE SEAT OR TIRES I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND. This product doesnt come off too easily and will spread with heat. If you spray on the tires or seat it will look great but your butt and the bike will slide everywhere. This is designed to work with the Valterra bayonet fitting on your Gray or Black water dump valve and it does just that... I lube my slideout and other seals and gaskets on my motorhome about twice a year.  This works well on the gaskets of the storage compartments.  Be aware that it is really messy to spray on.  You have to open your slides to access the seals, and this comes out of the can similar to engine degreaser - a foam that is messy.  It gets on the painted surfaces and needs to be wiped off promptly. With a straw from another lube can, I can spray it on the top gasket which is almost impossible to reach.  For the side gaskets on the slideout, I find that it is less messy to put on a plastic glove, spray it in my hand, and rub it on.  Works okay that way.  If you are on the road, and your slideout seal is sticking or binding, try baby power. This is an effective product, but Thetford needs to change the nozzle to control the mess. 
I love these microfiber cloth! I use them to clean everything! Mostly for my cars! They do not leave scratches on your car and can be use for almost anything! I bought this as an extension for a tire-inflater and car vacuum where both plug into the 12V cigarette light socket.  With this, I can take the inflater and vacuum all around the vehicle with no worries.  I can even stretch it out and manage to use it for those items on another vehicle that's parked beside mine.  So, I'm please with it. This is the only car wash soap I use and it works good.  After over a year of using it I had a company come and detail my car and they couldn't believe my car hadn't been waxed in over a year (I do wash my car once a week). It keeps your car clean and feeling smooth.Side note - I am not saying this will replace you waxing your car.  Your car should be waxed too. 
I love these microfiber cloth! I use them to clean everything! Mostly for my cars! They do not leave scratches on your car and can be use for almost anything! I use it in every one of my cars! Fits well and its washable/reuse for the life of the car. Does exactly what it is supposed to and you can use it without having to run around the vehicle to turn the water on and off. 
Does the job and seems to be a quality product.  Would recommend to do it yourselfers.  Could use a few added attachments or I would have rated it a 5. This product has been proven to work well. It does what it promises to do and very well. I recommend it to anyone. good adapter, no problem with it yet, does the job when i need it. I do recommend. Doesnt worth it to pay more.tks 
I had my Vespa dealership recharge my Piaggio BV250 battery after winter storage.  They actually used this battery tender to charge it for me.  However, they only sold the Deltran Tender Jr (0.75 Amp).  This charger has a faster charging time than the 0.75 Amp.  My batteries charge in about 4-6 hours whereas the Jr take about double that (though exact timing obviously depends on how depleted your batteries are).  I've used this charger since then and it's been great.  It's simple to use: plug it in, connect the clamps or leads to your battery and wait for the green light to light up (indicating a full charge).  There are two sets of connecting cables (one is a clamp and the other a screw on) which is good depending on your need.  One benefit of these two cables is that they actually fit into each other and can be used to connect your battery to your bike WHILE your battery is outside of your bike - I had to use this feature because I accidentally shut my seat (lock is battery powered) when the battery was out and had to connect my battery remotely.If you have a Vespa or other scooter, I would highly recommend getting this charger.  In cold weather, scooter batteries die in about 3-6 weeks of inactivity. I am very pleased with this battery maintainer.  I purchased the cigarette light plug along with this unit and it is so easy to use.  I plugged it in, set it to normal charge and brought a totally discharged battery back to life.  The battery is holding the charge just fine and I couldn't be happier.  I especially like the &#34;supply&#34; mode on this unit so I can change out a battery without losing the codes on my car.  No one should be without this charger.  I have a car that sits in the garage and used sparingly and this device keeps the battery fully charged. I've had good luck with this charger.  I use it to charge a standard starter battery and two Optima blue top deep cycle batteries on my aluminum bass boat.  The charger has settings for standard, agm, and gel batteries as well as 15amp, 10 amp and 2 amp charging rates.  Adjust the charging rate to the size of the battery being charged.  Charger also displays voltage of battery or percent of charge reading at your option.  Auto shut off and displays a green light when fully charged. All charging is done in my garage.  The charger is stored there as well, out of the elements.  I've had no problems in the two years I've owned it.  Maintain your batteries during times of inactivity by charging at least monthly and they'll start your outboard when it's time to fish.  A very good charger for the money spent. 
We have cars with full of electronic gadgets so they consume significant electricity, even when car is being driven. Almost every week we get no start due to weak battery. I have an external car battery charger (old). It is bulky to setup to charge cars overnight. Also it does not have any detection, so the battery can be continuously overcharged, which will eventually damage the battery (as multiple battery experts tell me). Never learned our lesson as we had 3 quality batteries purchased and replaced - each within 2 years.After reading all the great reviews, I bought one of these on-board charger and installed in one of the car that frequently dies (even with new battery). Now I can just plug in to the wall when car is parked each night, and unplug in the morning before the commute. No need to check if charging is complete if not driven for days! Also it will reduce the risk of not able to start the car to almost none.I will be buying another one for our other electronic gadgets-heavy car...  The next convenient thing is to find a good retractable power cords that can either be installed in the car with the on-board charger, or to the outlets for which the charger will be tapping power from. I have aWagan Power Dome EX 400-Watt Jump Starter with Built-In Air Compressorthat is a permanent tool in one of our family car. That unit's quality was highly questionable. Finally on the third replacement I had a good one. It had the features I wanted: compressor (for kids bikes, balls), inverter, USB power, and jumper. It was a worthy compromise of battery power and features.But I want a second unit, with focus on a battery that can power my electronics longer and jump a car. This model seems to allow longest running of electronics out of all battery-based units with inverter/jumper.When this unit arrive, I expected to charge for 48 hours per instruction. But seems like the unit was already fully charged before shipping out. Within minutes, the charging status showed solid green and battery status reported 100%. That's nice when they can charge it (Amazon warehouse?) before shipping it out.First test powering my more power-hungry laptops (80 watts), LCD monitors, portable fans, etc. I'm happy to report the expected duration is quite accurate. For example, one of my appliance that averages 75 watt runs for about 2 hours and 20 minutes. 100 watt electronics ran for 2 hours.*SIDE NOTE* One of my favorite thing is to power my PS3 console in this marvelous gaming case:GAEMS Halo UNSC Vanguard Personal Gaming Environment (Xbox NOT Included)As for starting a car with dead battery, I had the opportunity to tested just 2 days after receiving it. I had left my car's lights on in the morning, and by start of evening the battery was not strong enough to start the car. After connecting the jumpers, the first two cranks resulted in no go. After waited for 5 minutes, I started the car again and the car started without any hesitation.What this means to me that the rated crank amp of 350CA is not strong enough to jump start most cars with a "dead" battery. (I think AAA guy once told me average cars need 600 - 700 crank amps).  Even my Wagan 400 watt inverter (with 600 crank amps) couldn't get car started on first try many times.  If it cannot start immediately, don't panic! Wait a few minutes!  A car battery is technically dead at 12V, and fully charged at 12.6 - 12.8V. So by letting the powerpack to charge the car battery for 5 - minutes, it frequently is enough to raise the voltage close to 12.6 to start the car.Anyway, it's a good start for me on this battery. But time will tell if the battery can retain charge to be useful for at least two years. Will update here in a few months. I originally purchased the Deltran Battery Tender Jr. (021-0123) to keep the battery on my vehicle charged as it&#8217;s advertised of being capable of doing so on the packaging. This battery tender did not charge the battery on my car within the 72 hour window and turned off (Has a built-in timer). I called Deltran (877-456-7901) and was told by customer service that the Deltran Battery Tender Jr. was too small to use on a car/truck battery and that I should have purchased the Deltran Battery Tender Plus. I eventually purchased the Deltran Battery Tender Plus (021-0128) and the Deltran 12.5 ft. extension lead (DBT081-0148-12). The Deltran Battery Tender Jr. works fine on my walk behind lawn mower with electric start and should be fine for anything with a small battery. I would suggest that you purchase the Deltran Battery Tender Plus so you can have the option of using it on more equipment. Deltran should change the label on the Deltran Battery Tender Jr. if it&#8217;s not really intended for car/truck batteries. Check out batterytender.com for Deltrans&#8217; complete line. 
The flooded battery for my riding mower wouldn't hold a charge for more than day, regardless of whether it was trickle-charged with a battery tender or charged in recovery mode with my Diehard Platinum charger.  Skeptical, I ordered this after reading that it was both reliable and had the potential to revive an otherwise useless battery.9 hours of charging later ... and my riding mower battery now holds a charge.  I also put a ring terminal comfort indicator onto the mower battery and deliberately let the mower sit ... and the battery moved from green to yellow (fully charged to less than 80% charged) across a week ... instead of full discharge in a single day.I probably need a new battery for the riding mower, but this charger bought me time AND proved its worth -- doing what my $90 Diehard Platinum charger could not. I see a lot of negative reviews for this charger that I think are partially due to Amazon's incorrect description and the fact that most people don't know what size or type of charger they need. (including myself)I am a practicing Electronic engineer with more than 20yrs experience. I did not know much about battery chargers until recently researching what a good battery charger should do.1) this charger only delivers a max of 1.5A. This means if you try to charge a discharged auto battery (48AH) it will take a long long time. This charger does work great for topping off a car battery at 70% (12.4V).2) The instructions included clearly state the charger will automatically shut-off after 12 hours of charging. The charger will restart and continue charging if you unplug and then plug the charger in again. Best to get a higher capacity charger.3) This charger does have a float mode sort of. Actually it shuts off the charging current and monitors battery voltage. When the battery voltage drops low enough the charger cycles on to top it off and then shuts off again.MY SUMMARY 1st:I like this charger and think it does a good job for the PRICE. Gold box special was $15.20 + tax. (I would definitely buy it at the regular price for $3$)It's basically automatic. Don't have to set the voltage and it won't damage anything if you reverse the clips accidently. Compact size and reasonable quality clamps.This charger does what it is designed for. That is charge small batteries and top off larger automotive batteries. This is an excellent maintenance charger for all batteries to keep them fully charged when not in use. (My opinion)Personally I would not leave any charger connected to my battery for more than 24 hours. Now I use a cheap mechanical timer that is set to turn on for 1 hour every 24 hours. I would prefer a timer that I can set to turn on twice a week for a few hours.The charger is small feels solidly built with heavy plastic. It gets very warm aftercharging at 1.5A but not warm enough to be concerned. (no cooling fan)I gave this charger 5 stars because PRICE and performance is very good. Build quality is good as well.AMAZON DESCRIPTION (Poor): is incorrect in that this charger is not intended to be used to charge a LOW (discharged) car battery. The chart in the DESCRIPTION that shows the charging times is different than the manual.. The included MANUAL has a chart that states this charger should only be used as a "top off" or maintenance charger for auto batteries. In addition the charger in charging mode automatically shuts off after 12 hours of charging. (A good safety feature in my opinion.)Charging details:I discharged a car/truck jump start battery pack to 12.45V or approx 75% charge.(Typical full charge is 12.65V to 12.7V. To discharge the battery I used a battery/alternator tester. I have a voltmeter attached to charger and a current meter in series with battery and battery charger negative terminal.1) At the start of the charge, the charge current was 0.78A and then jumped to 1.52A in a few minutes.2) After 1 hour the charge current is 1.47A. Charge voltage is 13.0V.3) After 2 hours the charge current is 1.48A. Charge voltage is 13.25V.4) After 3 hours the charge current is 1.43A. Charge voltage is 13.46V.5) After 4 hours the charge current is 1.40A. Charge voltage is 13.82V.Note: that the charge current is decreasing as the battery is approaching full charge. This design feature will prevent overheating and extend the life of your battery.6) After 5 hours the charge current is 0.68A. Charge voltage is 14.71V.7) After 5.5 hours the charge current is 0.35A. Charge voltage is 14.67V.8) After 6 hours the charge current is 0.29A. Charge voltage is 14.73V.9) After 6.5 hours the charge current is 0.24A. Charge voltage is 14.72V.10) After 8.5 hours the charge current is 0.20A. Charge voltage is 14.73V.11) After 10.5 hours the charge current is 0.15A. Charge voltage is 14.71V.12) After 11.5 hours the charge is COMPLETE and the charge current has dropped to 0.0A. BATTERY voltage is 13.55V and declining. Charger is in the monitor mode. In monitor mode the charger AC power is 3W measured with a Belkin Watt meter.Almost 12 hours seems like a long time to charge a battery and this isn't even a full capacity car battery. But, it did a good job of gently charging the battery especially when it was near full charge. The important thing to me is the charging current declined as the battery neared full charge. This prevents overcharging and truly tops off the battery to maximum capacity.I tested the battery the next day with a battery tester and it passed well within the "good battery" full charge limits. The results were much better than the charger that came with the battery pack where it tested NEAR "weak".Very happy with the purchase. I would buy this exact model again. Should there be any problem(s) in the future I will update this review.Ships from and sold by Amazon. Using this to reach a motorcycle far away from the outlet while. Charges just the same and the battery tender still indicates when the battery is charged properly 
This adapter works, but the clips do not open wide enough to clamp on my battery posts. I was able to attach to the cables coming off the posts, albeit barely adhering. I love the simplicity and reliability of this unit. It comes with 4 alligator clips and 4 O ring clips to hardwire to something like my atv. I hardwired the connector to the quad so all i need to do it connect and disconnect the quick connect clips. If Monster cable could only see the copper inside this jacket.  Normally when you cut a piece of heavy cable in the center and strip back the insulation you see nice shiny copper.  Granted the ends may be oxidized a bit but they are open to the air - I cut this at the halfway point to make 2 shorter cable sets or 4 equal cable pieces. This cable, while being nice and flexible, looked like an old penny inside - heavily oxidized and ugly as sin.  I suspect its reclaimed copper 2 times over without proper slag removal.  That's the only reason I took away one star.Also the crimp lugs supplied leave a tad to be desired, but they include some properly sized red and black heatshrink.  You are supposed to put the stripped cable into the lugs then fold each half over the other with "electricians pliers" - My professional crimper was able to fold them but not close them tight on the wire, so out came the persuader - a 16 oz claw hammer and some cement.  Yep - that closed the crimp nice and snug on the wire.  Now it has a good snug grip.  I did buy some professional #4 lugs at the hardware store made of copper like a shiny penny and my professional crimper did those justice, so their lugs are a tad sub par but you can put them on with just about anything.  Alternately I could have hit it with a propane torch and fed some solder to it, which I may still do if there is excessive loss in the cable.  I prefer soldered connections wherever possible.I also bought some nice bolt on attachments at the hardware store for $2/pr that have a bar which snugs down with 2 ea 7/16 bolts and nuts on the back side.  Now that was a solid connection - I drove the bolts home with my dewalt 3/8" impact driver and a 7/16 socket which grabbed the wire and would not let go, then gave me a big ring to tie to that did not look like someone pounded a crimp lug with a hammer on cement to make it grab!I realize copper is expensive these days but this stuff was recycled 2 or 3 times over.  New copper wire shouldn't look like a 1960's penny under the couch.  It sure makes monster cable's oxygen free copper look bright and shiny by comparison. On the other hand, I did especially like the fact that the insulation is color coded properly, red and black.  I have seen high current wiring kits where the wire's insulation is entirely black, entirely white, or some other way of not coding the positive and negative by insulation color.  Even the space shuttle wiring is ENTIRELY white no matter what purpose it serves.  The only identification each white wire gets is a black wrapper with a 4 or 5 digit number that is referenced in the schematics.  Nasa's wire is also silver plated copper and thus carries the same current of cruddy copper wire 1 size larger with the same loss and less weight at 10x the price.Other than the cruddy copper - it's a good value - you're getting 20 feet of #4 cable with precrimped lugs on one end and trimmable to length on the other end with a set of lugs you can pound onto the wire.  It certainly has the heft of 20 feet of #4 too - this shipped at over 5 lbs, most of which was the 2 pieces of #4 cable.  It ran my inverter just fine so no harm.You also get a green ground wire to tie your inverter chassis to whatever ground you have, be it in a car or a ground rod in the earth.  Like me you probably don't think you need a ground for a battery powered device - when wwas the last time you grounded your remote control?  In theory ground wires should cary no current nor any voltage, but the spinning fan on the inverter can cause static electricity.  You do need to equalize any static charge buildup or leakage in capacitors, or alternately stray magnetic fields causing voltage in metalic parts.  Sure these are small voltages, between 0.5 and 2.0 V but they can flip a logic state if not returned to ground and also making troubleshooting a nuisance.  While not absolutely necessary, if you don't ground it be sure that somewhere from the output path of the inverter to your load you have a GFCI plug.  That way if the current finds another path back to the battery or to the inverter chassis it will cut off power in a fraction of a second preventing electrocution - yours, not to mention damage to the equipment.Keep in mind that #4 wire can carry 100's of amps (approaching 1000 amps) and will do a nice job arc welding.  Once you get this installed treat it with a great deal of respect.  Don't be shocked (no pun intended) when you make the final connection if there is a SMALL arc - emphasis on SMALL - the reason is that there are capacitors in the inverters that help to smooth out the current flow and they charge instantly when power is applied. When finished, disconnect from the battery.  Use some extra caution when using tools like crecent wrenches around  deep cycle batteries =  don't bridge to the other terminal.  I had an electrician drop a crescent wrench inside a pac bell phone central office onto the -48VDC buss bars that powered the building's phone switch.  It didn't even blow the fuse - just vaporized the wrench into sputter.  We crawled down to the buss bars and there was nothing even resembling a wrench where it made contact with the -48VDC bars.  This product box even has a warning that if you are not familiar with high current wiring have someone who is do it. 
PROS:Tied to my Travel Trailer Battery to connect to my Solar Panel Charger.Quick Connect/Disconnect means you only mess with the terminals once, when you put this on the battery.Keyed so you don't create a short (Though be CAREFUL to orient it correctly on the battery posts).CONS: None. The perfect battery charger/maintainer for two batteries simultaneously. Appears to be well made, easy to follow directions, works like a charm, does what it says it will do. I have always been hard on deep cycle batteries and am hopeful this product will extend the life of my batteries by making it easy to charge, but not over-charge, and maintain them when they are not in use. The Battery Tender Alligator clips allow me to charge a battery without having to install the ring type terminals on the positive and negative posts.  I can also charge a battery without having to remove it from a vehicle or removing the cables from the battery.  A very handy item to use with my Deltran 4-bank charger. 
i am using this in 40-50 degree weather so I think it's too cold to use this product so i only gave it a 4/5. i am assuming once it gets warm i will have a better experience. exactly works as stated. though i use it only in winter months. in texas summers you would not need it. :) Bought one for my car about four years ago. Still using it so got one for my riding mower. Mounted it on the mower so I just plug in, which is great in the cooler months.  I'm in south Louisiana and still have to mow in late November but infrequently, so this keeps it fully charged.  I've had the one o. The mower for a couple seasons now and it's still ticking away. 
The 3rd generation powerprobe includes a number of changes for additional flexibility.  In short, it is a vehicle powered DVM with both a 20 foot cable and an additional 20 foot extension giving you a 40 foot working range around either the battery terminals or cigarette lighter outlet, both clips and a plug are included in the kit.With the series 3 units they use a hard gold plated banana jack to hold the removable probe or cables to extend your reach.  If you purchase the accessory kit, it includes piercing probes that self center on a conductor, pierce the insulation, and attach to the jack allowing you to tap a wire at any point to locate intermittant problems.While the DVM is backlit all the time, it also has 2 bright white LEDs facing forward to aid in finding and probing terminals in dark places.  The actual probe is hardgold plated with a sharp tip and removable at the banana jack.  Another identical probe is included with a screw-in female banana jack in the accessories kit to retrofit the powerprobe I and II units to accept external cables and probes.If you need to excite a circuit with a connection to battery ground or to battery positive, the switch allows a momentary connection to bridge the probe tip to either voltage which is useful in testing relay driven circuits, indicator lights, and other small current loads.  The prope voltage is always displayed during testing on the meter. The voltage/ground switch is circuit breaker protected in case you accidentally drive 12 volts into a chassis ground.  Additionally, since the switch takes abuse it is easily replaced if it fails with just a screwdriver.Combined with the testlead set, the powerprobe 3 greatly simplifies testing of vehicular wire and big rigs up to a single trailer.  The DVM has 5 selectable modes of operation designed for different problems.  Reading the manual is important to get the full value from this meter.Although the price is a little high, the design and construction quality are excellent.  Enough wire is provided to check running lights on trailers or to look for blown fuses.  All of the wiring is exceptionally flexible and heavily insulated with top quality connectors.  Both the tester and accessories come in hard plastic cases that can be stowed in a service box.Not mentioned in specifications is that although the probe runs from 12-24 VDC, the meter can be used to measure voltages up to 80VDC. With this 25 ft extension I can leave the Battery Tender inside the garageand close the door so it's not out in the weather ~nor any concern about the BT coming up missing,and reach my truck battery in the driveway to be sure it starts in the winter.We also keep a car in our one car garage, that is hardy ever driven,so periodically I connect the Batter Tender to the car to maintain that battery too.And the Battery Tender works equally well, with or with-out the 25 ft ex.The total potential lenght combining this cable, with the BT cords are about 38 ft.if continued in a straight line.The cords of the Battery Tender Plus are ~Electric cord  74" long ~Cable that clips to a battery 84" long ~ totaling over 13 ft.For me the BT extension cable is perfect.I leave my car hooked up for several days ~then add the 25 ft ex and clip to the truck.This extension cable is of good qualityand adds to the versatility of the BT Plus. Don't believe the ad statement 'heavy duty cord' translates into 'heavy duty' anything, other than maybe rubber insulation. THIS IS FOR LOW-POWER ITEMS ONLY!!! It is 20-AWG wire inside, barely enough wire diameter to run a 5-watt speaker. If you think you are going to plug in a tire inflator, a 1,000,000 candle spotlight, etc., you are SADLY MISTAKEN. This is NOT, repeat NOT heavy duty. It is a crime that the wire AWG (American Wire Gauge) is not listed in the specs. Otherwise, you would know that plugging in a heavy amperage load is either going to burn this up in a split second, or turn it into a heater coil and set your car on fire when you try. If you want to charge a cell phone, an iPad, etc. on it, go ahead, no problem. But the problem is, most people buy an extension cord for a cigarette lighter to do something with a heavy amp load outside of the vehicle. This WILL NOT support a heavy amp load. 
This is a very nice charger for many batteries, BUT it states AGM (not good for many). An AGM 12VDC VMAX, or Optima type RV or marine battery requires a special charger that will deliver 25-35 Amps, not 8. This is for a very small AGM battery. This cost over $120 and I will use it for regular flooded lead batteries but must buy another for AGM or Gel batteries for my RV. A specialty battery requires a specialty charger, I found out. I do recommend this, would buy again, and I hope this helps. I purchased this item for a lawn tractor to keep the battery up to charge when not in use. I have a different model Battery Tender I use on my motorcycle. These are the best 'trickle' chargers and 'battery-minders' on the market. The worst possible thing to do to a lead acid battery is to let it fully discharge.  I keep Battery Tenders on all my equipment batteries and have never had a battery fail in less than 8 years.  I did have one Battery Tender Jr go bad but the company replaced it for the $7 shipping fee. 
I returned this item because it was just too big on my throttle and not something I would have on my bike. I love the way it did spread evenly. I thought that I was going to have to use the whole tube of wax. But I don't think I used 1/4 of it. And I have a SUV. I was able to only use one of the applicator. But with this one I am glad I got it. I approve this review. Hahahahahahahahah They don't. I waited too long to try them so I can't return. The model optimizer clearly said this is what I should order. They are not sized properly. I've bought Bosch before too. 
I love the simplicity and reliability of this unit. It comes with 4 alligator clips and 4 O ring clips to hardwire to something like my atv. I hardwired the connector to the quad so all i need to do it connect and disconnect the quick connect clips. I have this securing a smittybilt receiver hitch with D-ring and I've been very happy with it.  Nice, snug fit.  No rattles.  Hav enot yet had a chance to test it's tensile strength in real-world recovery applications, but I don't think it's going to be the weak point.  Two keys included. If Monster cable could only see the copper inside this jacket.  Normally when you cut a piece of heavy cable in the center and strip back the insulation you see nice shiny copper.

No more "nagging" to close the screen door! You could probably buy a spring at your local hardware store for about the same price, but the pre-determined install tension (distance to drill holes) and where to mount the spring(s) makes it well worth the $7. I followed the instructions for screw hole distance and only needed 1 spring. Both springs may pull the door past the latch at rest (without door swinging closed), but a normal entry/exit the single spring has enough to overcome the latch without slamming the door. Need one say more?  And, these can be locked in place using a small lock you put in the tightening head (lock not included).  Once in place between the wheels on a tandem axle trailer, there's no way the trailer will move.  Cool! The good:  It adds significant security to a trailer.  The lock for the coupler latch can fit the wider models.  The lock that fits in the tongue where the hitch ball goes is easy to get on and off.Why it doesn't get five stars:1:  The lock for the coupler latch, even when lubricated and the cover on was a PITA to get the key inserted and wiggled in after the trailer was in one place for a couple months.  I was fearing that the key would break.2:  The tongue lock, it was hard to tell where to pull out the key.Would I buy this again?  Yes.  However, the lock for the coupler latch, I would throw away, and instead, I would consider using a long shackle padlock, or a lock that has an automotive-grade cylinder.  In all cases, I'd use some Tri-Flow or another locksmith-grade lubricant in all locks (NOT WD-40!) 
The hitch pin locks are wonderful.  High quality, durable, and weather proof.  But if I had to do it over, I might just buy the pin locks (Master Lock Key Alike Set with Receiver and Coupler Latch Locks, 2-Piece Set #2848DAT) without the coupler lock.  First of all, the coupler lock doesn't really deter someone from stealing your RV trailer if they are determined.  You can simply connect the chains to a vehicle and drive off or just cut the coupler lock off.  I use the claw for real security (Tire Claw XL Lock #491KA - ATV, Auto, Trailer Locks).  Therefore, the only thing the coupler lock does is deter the casual thief if you don't use the claw.  The ball is grey plastic with a steel inner, which should work well.  I find that when it's in place, it hangs down and looks kind of floppy.  I may just end up using the hitch pin locks and claw only and forget the coupler lock. Master Lock 262 DAT Chrome Lug Nut Style Spare Tire Lock is a simple to use and reasonable sturdy product.  Good value This is a solid, versatile lock that will fit Class II, Class III and Class IV hitch receivers.  Mine came with two hardened-steel chrome plated pins (not a sleeve as was illustrated when I bought it).  The smaller pin works with Class II and Class III hitch receivers.  The larger pin works with Class IV.  I use this lock to secure my bike rack and it's tough enough that I wouldn't want to lose my keys.  The keyhole is protected by a weather-resistant rubber cover, yet rotates for easy accessibility.  This is a rugged, versatile hitch lock offered at a good price. 
Amazon really needs to check some of their cross reference charts. This does not it a 2011 Kia LX Sorento. My last same-sized container anti-seize, standing at attention, lasting me 30 years (home use), so my children will finish this one.About it:It's silver in color, 8-oz. container (a bunch), -65F - 1600F, Anti-Seize, -Corrosion and -Galling; has Lid Brush; label indicates "Made in USA".Specific Use: Ease assembly and disassembly of hardware which experience extreme temperatures and/or corrosive conditions.I've used this routinely, and sparingly for it does not take much - just a light swipe on threads, mating surfaces etc.  Most of my last container went to lubricating boat and boat engine components for very good saltwater corrosion prevention.A general caution is: not apply to business end of sparkplug, O2 sensor etc (lightly on threads/sealing surface only) - else could impact component performance (never seen it happen lol).*UPDATE: I visited Permatex website - wished I'd done so earlier ... A summary:From Website Technical Data Sheets (TDS),This Permatex (80078) has ingredients of "aluminum, copper and graphite lubricants ... meets or exceed requirements of Mil Spec Mil-A-907E."Temperature Range: "-51F to 1600F"Flash: ">350F"TDS Applications: "Sparkplug threads, Exhaust & Engine Hardware, Brake Assemblies, Boilers, Ovens, Jet Engines and Turbines.", and does refer to a "Marine" use.Permatex Copper:  This may be a preferred product due to seemingly inherent do-all capability: Dielectric grease, anti-seize, anti-corrosion to include mating surfaces of dissimilar metals.

However, I returned it to Amazon since it did not fit up to a Ford Taurus flex fuel engine.  This type of engine requires a special fitting that this tool does not have.

They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Installed in a 2005 Tacoma (even though nobody lists one for the 05) and fits perfectly. I purchased this to be able to attach a high-end hydraulic assisted bike rake on the back of my Jeeps (JKs) with the rear tire still on.  It fit perfectly and teamed with the Bolt Lock BLT7018448 5/8'' Receiver Lock (Keyed specifically for your line of vehicle) it can be kept in the Jeep and my daughter doesn't need anything but her car key.The extender is exactly as advertised, well made, fit perfectly and does eactly what it is inteded for. 
Product shipped quickly. It is as described and will work fine for my vehicle. Do not order the Reese Power ball 72802 as the hitch mount is 3/4" and the draw bar is 1" mount. You'll need a bushing or return it for a larger mount. I purchased this to be able to attach a high-end hydraulic assisted bike rake on the back of my Jeeps (JKs) with the rear tire still on.

I installed this brake controller in a 1955 GMC pickup truck that I use for towing. Just follow the diagram for wiring and it just works like a breeze. I like the way you can adjust easily the voltage with the dial on the left and the mounts provided allows you to install it a convenient location under the dash (it works in any position).If you want to install this in a more modern truck without tapping directly into the wires, you will need additional adapters at extra cost. They fit perfectly onto the vehicle and or trailer wire when not in use. With the retaining loop they stay with the connectors when you are connected vehicle to trailer.

Fit my '98 Nissan Frontier's oil pan perfectly. Looks to be of nice quality.  Torque to 25ft/lbs (on the Frontier anyway) Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles.

I ordered this to help make a better fit for the bike rack on the front of a Ford Expedition. I was specifically hunting for a fairly short extension because I wanted the bikes to stick out no further than necessary. The selection of holes in this extension allowed me to adjust the fit into the receiver, as well as the fit of the bike rack into the extension. This allowed me to fit the bikes about 2 inches closer to the vehicle than any other extension I was able to find. Very pleased with its performance.

I have previously used in: 1980 Honda CX500C to fix a rough idle, 2000 Suzuki SV650 to stabilize fuel, and a 2005 Chevy Cobalt to fix a problem with stalling at idle. I mounted this as an auxiliary transmission cooler in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 with the 4.0.  No issues.  Obviously, this was a custom installation.  But with a little research on the jeep forums, no problem. Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend. 
The 32778 Slide Out Rubber Seal Conditioner made things alittle better. But I am going to replace the seals. Not because of the conditioner. They have weather cracks on my seals. This stuff is silicone grease which is non conductive. I use these on all the ignition of all cars I work on and not just that. I use it for lubricating door hinges or places where there's a lot of rubber since this stuff doesn't eat away at it. I use JB Weld for everything and it rarely if ever disappoints.I had a problem with people stealing the mirrors off one of my motorcycles, so I JB Welded them to the bars.  Fixed!I had a lamp harp with a broken threaded fitting, so I JB Welded it back on and it works perfectly!I had door stoppers that kept falling off, so I JB Welded them and they're solid now!I've used JB Weld for at least 100 other fixes and I love the stuff. 
Does a super job on brass, copper, silver, aluminum, bronze and stainless steel. Polishes most metals to a mirror-like finish. Very similar to Flitz polishing cream. The Quik Interior Detailer is a great product from Meguiars. This provides the finish I like on my interior (not too glossy, but a nice clean matte finish).This interior detailer spray also has a nice smell to it. Safe for all surfaces (vinyl, leather, plastic, chrome, navigation/entertainment consoles and LCD screens). This does not only protect, but cleans stains, road film etc. off the paint and bring its to nice clean shine. My cars have ranged from light colours (white and silver) to darker colours (red and blue) and this works perfectly to clean and protect. Sometimes, depending on how dirty the paint was,  2 applications would be done to restore the finish. Safe on clear coats and glass this is perfect. Also, one heavy shower does not remove the wax. Give it a try. 
cleans very well removes brake dust and stuck on grime..need to spray on and let soak scrub with brush..hose off..if stains are old or been on rims for awhile you will have to do a second clean but it will remove 95% of grime We have a typical pull behind travel trailer.  This drainer works perfect.  It doesn't hold a lot (it is for a camper sink) but keeps clean dishes off the dirty sink bottom. A must have.  Everybody who uses buckets should buy one of these.  It keeps the dirt on the bottom of the bucket and really does help keep the car clean while using sponges or wash wands. 
Purchased this to use as both a parking stop and a target to use for aligning my trailer when parking in my garage.  It is very well made, as has been my experience with other Camco products.  Anticipate the adhesive on the underside will suitably secure the AccuPark to the concrete floor to maintain a consistent location. I use these caps, in conjunction with the Lynx levelers, to create a flat surface for the camper tire to sit on. I also use several under the jack tongue to minimize excess jacking when leveling the camper from front to rear. They can also be used under the 4 corner stabilizing jacks to create a flat surface for the stabilizer feet. Would highly recommend. We have a typical pull behind travel trailer.

Meguiar's Deep Crystal line is meant as an inexpensive alternative to the more expensive Meguiar's product lines.  This liquid wax works very well, and contains Carnauba, but is not their best product.This product is Step 3 in the Deep Crystal line, and would be used after Step 1 (Wash) and Step 2 (Polish).  The product is applied by hand or dual action polisher then wiped off after it dries.  Very simple and effective.The "look" of this product is highly subjective, but it does not have the clarity or longevity of other Meguiar's waxes.  It should also be noted that this product has been discontinued, so don't get too addicted to it!  If you want a great carnauba wax from Meguiar's, look into Gold Class Carnauba Plus. I read all the other companies material on how well their products worked on rust. I had planned on using the POR product but as with several other ones I was worried about how harsh and toxic they were. This product is  water based no harsh fumes and cleans up with water! So far I have used almost two bottles on a very rusty undercarriage. The product works fantastic, isn't scary to handle and the finished results are beautiful. You have to recoat in about twenty min. for the coverage to even out. In 24hours it dries to a hard satin black finish which you can top coat. This product  goes a long way for such a small bottle. A great buy! This product is more of a glaze than a swirl remover.  While it does have some cutting ability it may not work well on new clear coat paint.  If you use this product I recommend to top it off with a good quality wax or sealant such as Meguiar's  Ultimate Wax.  (paste or liquid) 
This is basically a manual vacuum to suck up oil or other liquids from inside your engine or other places where oil or fluids are used. It includes everything you need and works pretty well, although sicking up 4-5 quarts can be a little slow, so be patient. I use it for oil changes so I don't need to always undo the drain plug and replace the compression washer (don't forget to replace the filter too!). I've heard so many horror stories about damage to the threads on the oil pan drain plug from over tightening that I decided to reduce the number of times I go there. That's where this Fluid Evacuator comes in. Warm up the engine a little, turn everything off, slip the straw like hose down the dip stick hole and suck up the oil. Change the filer and refill the oil and you're done. For me that means I don't have to remove panels under the car to access the oil pan drain plug and I don't have to put the car up on stands. Those both take a lot of time, so this evacuator is a great time saver. The tank is big enough to hold the oil from my larger car's engine and when the tank is full, the Mityvac can be put into reverse and pump out the contents too, so you don't need to pour out the tank.It includes several different diameter &#34;straws&#34; that are designed to slip down the dipstick hole or other filler holes (like on a differential). Those straws connect to clear piping so the Evacuator can be standing on the garage floor.Remember that oil and similar liquids flow best when warm. However, don't get the fluids hot and don't run the motor with the straw inserted! I read about someone who did that and the meshing gears pulled the straw into them, causing the motor to stall and needed to take apart the engine to get the straw out!!About my only complaint with the Evacuator is I wish it had more strays since I'd also like to drain the radiators using this but don't want to use the oily motor oil straw where oil isn't wanted in the radiator. Otherwise this is a great tool to have available. Keep in mind that it does require a dip stick hole for  sucking up the oil, so if you have a newer Porsche or similar car with a digital dipstick, you may not be able to use this. Check on forums for you car if you're unsure. ...oil to water, this agent will solve any need you have to patch, bond, fix, fill, attach, mend, glue, fasten, stick, plus it is resilient to cold, heat, vibration and surfaces can be slick or porous.I used Ultra Black until this came out and.yes it does make great gaskets but that is only the biginning. I fixed tears in my kayak, patched up my.boots, bonded a toaster oven under counter...anyways, you should get the idea by now. MY EXPERIENCE: One of the things I really like about this funnel, is how long it is. It can literally reach down inside an automotive engine with ease, so that I can pour new oil into the crankcase, without getting it all over the engine, which could cause an oil fire!The bottom of the funnel is narrow for the first 6 inches. Which means, I can get it into a tractor dipstick tube, and effortlessly add oil. Because of the total length of the funnel, I am able to add more oil at a time, without worrying about spilling out of the funnel.Because of this same feature, I am able to put it through the filler hole of a vehicle gas tank, and it will stay there, and then I can pickup my gas can, and add a couple gallons of gas to the tank.OTHER USES: Here is another use, many of you may have not thought of. With a small mower, to drain the oil, all you have to do is tip the mower to its side, and let it drain into a pan. However, you can't do this with a tractor, because the engine is mounted to the tractor frame. So, I cant get a pan under the frame because there is my right side wheel in the way. After I attach my drain tube to the drain valve on my engine, I then take the Super Funnel, and place the tube into it, and then the funnel, into the oil pan. There you go, draining made simple!CONCLUSION: Though, I had to spend more then I would for any regular funnel, it is well worth the cost I spent on it, when I consider what uses I can get out of it. Like I said, tiny funnels are great for small things, but for larger engines, you need to get serious. I just love my Super Funnel, and if you buy one, you will too! 5 out of 5 
This Curt Manufacturing 5/8 in. Hitch Lock works great so far.  I have not had any issues with it yet. I didn't know this was what was already on my car when I bought another to replace it. When removing the existing one I found moisture had made its way into the components inside, under the cap. I would take an educated guess that it was due to an inferior o-ring or bad vent cap. There was some oxidation on various parts and even some rust, which I've never seen in any other vehicles I've owned over the past 20 yrs. The matching rotor was a PITA to remove, which I will explain in the rotor review. I won't buy this or the rotor again. This is the only product that I have ever used on the &#34;Soft-touch&#34; interiors on the 5 VWs and 1 Audi that I have owned. I have never had a problem with peeling and probably never will, as long as I use this to clean the itnerior. Has a pleasant smell and works really well! 
The plastic is very good quality, the brush does a great job...not much else to say...no complaints. I prefer using a brass scraper as it won't scratch the glass as easily as plastic (this scraper WILL scratch paint/glass if you aren't careful). This treatment works well to &#34;kill&#34; rust and should be used along with a good rust primer and top coat paint to prevent future reoccurrence of corrosion returning. This product essentially treats the rust as the surface of the metal becomes pitted and sanding or grinding does not remove all of it before painting. Good product to use in any area you do not want to continually do over. This product is an absolute must to have on the shelf for any auto or product used in high salt states such as in the Northeast area of the country. Small price to pay for an added layer of security to your rust prevention project. This scratch remover seems to be more of a polish  and lube that will remove the surface scratches for the paint. It does not appear to have any &#34;grinding&#34; type ingredients in the paste.It will have little of no impact on deep scratches or deep nicks in the paint. It is easy to out on and remove and will a decent job for those light scratches. It did not remove any discoloring on my paint such as a stain left by a bird dropping. It ddi make the blemish lighter though. 
It does what it is supposed to and suds up. Bright red and high pigment content for rapid coverage. Dries to touch in less than 10 minutes.  Looks great once finished.  Watch out for paint drips as the can applies paint at a high rate.  Keep 8 to 10 inches away as a minimum and apply several light coats.Biggest issue is that the paint must cure to be brake fluid and brake cleaner resistant.  You must remove the caliper and bake it in an oven at 200 deg F for an hour, followed by brake line bleeding when reconnecting.  The caliper doesn't get hot enough to cure the paint during braking as the pads don't conduct sufficient heat into the caliper - maybe 100 deg F at most, even with really hard braking.  Consider an epoxy paint if you can't bake the parts, otherwise you can just use regular paint with the same result. Does exactly what it is supposed to and you can use it without having to run around the vehicle to turn the water on and off. 
These item does fit perfect on my 2004 BMW x3. does what its suppose to do. so far so good thanks Does what it is designed to do and Amazon has great prices on them. But, if you are replacing yours on a ford f-250 with 5.4 go with 15718 with the longer cord. And a 2003 f250 w/5.4L only has 2 not 4 like it shows. The tool appears to be of average quality.  However, I returned it to Amazon since it did not fit up to a Ford Taurus flex fuel engine.  This type of engine requires a special fitting that this tool does not have. 
I cannot believe how cheap these things have become.I bought one at least 10 years ago in France and it cost me at least 100 bucks.Unfortunately, with the time, the lock has become rusty and was grinding when operating.I was afraid I would find it some day unable to use when needed or worse, unable to reopen once set on the brake disc of my motorcycle.So I started looking for a new one and this Trimax is the choice.I like how sturdy it looks.I like the plastic cap on the keyhole that will prevent rust.I like the price!!!I like the reminder cable... I fell once or twice while starting my bike after forgetting it was still locked. I was fortunate not to break anything but having a reminder that your bike is still secure is a smart thing.So yes, I do recommend this product warmly! This will be the 773rd review for this product, so I'm guessing that this is not the first one you've read. It's safe to assume you already know enough about how it works. As such, I may not have a lot of information to add, except for the fact that I've had this nozzle for at least five years.  I'm not sure exactly when I bought it, but it was definitely no later than 2009.I've used it consistently over that time, for washing the car, hosing off the patio by the pool, washing the dog, cleaning the pool filter, etc etc. It's heavy-duty enough to drop on the concrete, it just lands with a dull thud from that thick rubber ring around the end, and years of abuse haven't affected it in the slightest.  The stream selection by rotating the outer ring is still as smooth as the day I bought it.Being able to turn it off at either end of the rotation is a nice feature too, less messing with it when you're done using it. I had intended to buy another one for the hose in the back of the house, but instead I've just been switching this one back and forth as necessary.If you're looking through these reviews because you're interested in buying one (why else would you be?), get one.  It's worth the money. I had to change out an old 20-inch tire for a new one on my Craftsman riding mower.  I've changed a lot of bike-type tires over the years but nothing like the mower tire.  I needed some kind of tire tools and didn't have any.  Since these looked like a step up from a couple of over-sized screw drivers, I thought they might do.I'm glad I bought them but, in order to complete the job, I found that I needed an automobile sized tire tool as well.  Still, I'm glad to have these in the tool box for future projects.  They are well made and I expect them to be around after I'm not. 
Works great, nice to have a second cable, but the OBD end of the cable is angled.  In my case, this cable won't work on my Subaru Outback.  I would prefer the option of a straight OBD connector.  Note that the angle connector works on my other four cars (Mazda, Honda, Dodge). This is a solid, versatile lock that will fit Class II, Class III and Class IV hitch receivers.  Mine came with two hardened-steel chrome plated pins (not a sleeve as was illustrated when I bought it).  The smaller pin works with Class II and Class III hitch receivers.  The larger pin works with Class IV.  I use this lock to secure my bike rack and it's tough enough that I wouldn't want to lose my keys.  The keyhole is protected by a weather-resistant rubber cover, yet rotates for easy accessibility.  This is a rugged, versatile hitch lock offered at a good price. There are two horns, not one. One is 400Hz and the other one is 500Hz.PIAA | Automotive Sports Horn (400/500Hz) #85110The are exact fits on the mounts as the OEM horns and use the same bolts. A 1/4 inch drive ratchet and a 12mm socket is needed to remove and install the bolt. They came with grounding leads with ring spade lugs that mounted readily under the existing M6 bolts on the radiator supports. All you need is a 10mm socket.The two wiring harness leads are too short to connect the horns. Two wire tie mounts hold the harness to the aluminum bumper reinforcement. You can cut off the ties and use the OEM harness to connect the horns, but I chose not to.  I prefer NOT to cut off the OEM connector blocks.I made two pigtail extensions out of 18 gauge black primary wire, 5 inches long. One end needs a 1/4 inch wide exposed male quick disconnect. The other end needs an insulated female 1/4 inch quick disconnect terminal. Since I used 18 gauge wire, I used the red coded ones.The exposed male connector slides into the OEM horn connector perfectly. The female one clips easily onto the positive terminal of each horn.The horns how have a weather shield on the apertures.Best thing to my surprise is that they appear to be very high quality and Made in Japan.Also nice is that they need no modification to the horn relay or circuit. 
ok, but very light weight Didn't realize that this had a 3500LB capacity and 350 FT LBS for the tongue weight.  I'm using this on my travel trailer so I can take all our bicycles which all three bikes and bike rack make up a tongue weight of 180lbs.  A great buy These seem well made and are as advertised.  Heavy yes but the construction seems worth the weight.  Look at the mfg weight rating.  While these seem strong enough for automotive work I would be leery for weight limits over recommendation.  I concur with all of the positive reviews. 
Nice looking product with the black coating.  Only fits the 2 inch receivers though.  It will be put to use on another vehicle! Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. I have been a fan of the Rain X blades, The latitude are new to me as I have always used the standard ones.  These work even better, they fit perfectly on my Audi that uses some new style clip, i was suprised that Rain X provided the additional clip to fit this application.

Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. Great Fit 
Used this on A  Brute force 750.  Extended the rear hitch out past the back bsket.  No need to crawl under and past the basket to get the hitch.  iIt is solid thru and thru.  It is not a hollow tube.  But a solid piece of piece of steel with the holes drilled in it, where the hitch mets the extender.  I have used this extender on my F250 and Dodge aslo to haul a 7000 lb. piece of equipment.  No problems whatsoever with it. Built tuff and made to take on a ram.  You won't be disappointed if you buy this and need the extra length of extension for your hitch on any vehicle. Installed this with a Curt hitch on a 2002 crv. It plugs into the ready made connection by the driver side quarter panel. I store the extra cord beneath the table in the storage area and just run the cord out through the rear door when towing. The weatherstripping protects the wiring from damage. Very easy and no splicing and wiring to mess with. Hope this review helps. This doesn't fit my 2007 Toyota Tacoma factory hitch.  It needs to be 2 7/8".  The package on this lock reads 2 5/8 but I measured it at 2 3/4.  I'm going to have to grind the bolt.Update, Jan 2014.  An noted I had to grind the inside ends to make this fit in my Tacoma OEM hitch.  Once, it was ground to the proper length, I spray-painted the bolt and have used it to haul a 19-foot trailer and attach my tow hook ever since with no further problems. 
Fits my low clearance Mazda 5 that comes with alloy wheels and 3/4 inches of clearance between the inside of the tire and the suspension.  Have not tried it in the snow yet. Super heavy chain. Adjust chain so the tripod is about 6 inches lower that leveled trailer. Raise tripod using wrench included. Do not supoport full weight of trailer. This is for stabilization of the 5th wheel. In our case in provided extra stabilization for the bedroom. This is everything you need in a tread depth gauge, and nothing you don't. Here's how you use it: You press the &#34;probe&#34; down into the tread gap to measure the depth. You then rotate the cylinder around to match the exact mark to the line. The measurements are on four sides of the cylinder, making them easier to read than being stacked on top of one another. Being able to rotate the cylinder makes it much easier to measure something as minute as 1/32 of an inch. 
Exactly what was offered, fit nicely, no major prep work, won't fade or crack, adjusts perfectly, easy removal and fits under seat in truck Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. Great Fit 
Great Item works on most trailers and best part it is rekeyable if you know how! Fits on 2" and 1 & 7/8 would only use this along with a tounge lock and some sort of wheel lock as well You can't have a better tool in your garage if you own several vehicles,so stop looking and make the best purchase ever! Best Gauge Ever. This is a very accurate tire gauge. I use this all the time and never have any issues with it. Easy air release button without having to remove gauge. Built very well and is very easy to use. A must for a garage tool box. Fair price for a great automotive tool. 
Lock is solid - no problem there.  I have a pull behind smoker grill that I needed to secure.  The only complaint is with a 2" hitch, the lock seemed "sloppy" when it came to fit.  I don't think I could remove the lock from the hitch, but I would like it to be a little more snug... Overall, good design... Very clever idea. Had to use on my 2013 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Sahara with a lift kit and adjustable drop hitch. Spinning ball hitches for different sizes won't work in my case because the adjustable hitch height is a solid piece specific to the entire hitch. In order to tow my 2 different trailers I'd need 2 drop hitches. Interchangeable balls is the perfect solution and I have to say these are perfect. They work well and are rated around 8k pounds of towing. Saved a lot of money here compared to my closest towing accessory store. I bought this product and you can't tell from the picture, but it has an extra 'ring' that keeps it attached to the hitch even when the plug is not in the hitch... when you're using it to tow or to hold a rack.  This is a great bargain for the money and seems to be a genuine Mopar part. 
I was suprised how well and how easy they worked even on an extended van.  It saves wear and tear on the shoulders. this car wash mitt is perfect for washing my vehicles. it is thick enough to hold the soapy water yet soft enough to not scratch the paint. Once a year seems pretty accurate. I'm sure it varies on where you live, how dirty your car gets, how often you wash it, how you wash it, what detergent you use, etc., etc. But it was highly rated by Consumer Reports so I figured I'd give it a shot. Goes on, wipes off easy - or about the same as other paste waxes I've used. Oh, and yes, this is a polish not a cleaner. If your paint is really dirty, faded, etc, then you need to use a cleaner first then a polish. Put it on thin, in the shade, keep it off plastic, use a microfiber cloth - in other words follow the directions and use it correctly and it works great. And, yes, if you have chips in your paint they will turn white - just like with any other polish. 
Works great for drying the car quickly and easily when its not hot enough out to do it quickly, and you don't wanna have to polish out all the water spots afterwords (Black car). This thing absorbs so much water you won't believe it till you use it, and it just takes a beating and keeps on going. When I first used it I was afraid I was gonna rip it by twisting the water out too hard, nope, just keep wringing it out until its dry and continue on.A little secret to using it, at least I've found it to work better this way. When drying the car, lay the Absorber out flat (unfold it across the surface) and then grasp it at one end at each corner and drag it slowly across the car allowing it to absorb all the water it comes into contact with. This works especially well on horizontal surfaces, but still good enough on the vertical ones as well. This practice also helps to prevent scratching of the surface when small particles get trapped between the chamois and the paint surface and then your hand comes and pushes it right into the paint.Little warning, when it comes, don't smell it. Mine reeeeekkkkkeeedddd! But I just rinsed it out and the smell went away. Yes it is true that you can put it right back into the tube wet (Well to get it back in the tube, you must, because you can't roll it once it dry), but I like to leave the top off of the tube to allow air in there to dry it out before I close it up and that musty gross smell comes back.Long story short: Get it, you won't be disappointed. There are a few things to know about the absorber to get the most out of them.  First, before using, soak in warm water, this makes it more absorbent.  Second, keep it clean.  The wort thing you could do is have a dirty chamois and drag it across your paint, this will introduce maring of your clear coat.  I wash it on gentle cycle with a little distilled vinegar then air dry.  When storing, get it as dry as possible.  Ive had them get moldy in the container from being too damp. This leaves the best 'patina' so far on our exterior vinyl stripping. Eliminates water spots and brings out the reflective highlights without a greasy residue. Does not bleed off when wet either.Normally haven't had consistent results with any Meguiar's stuff, but Barry's got a home run with this. 
This towel cuts drying time in half. This is all I use to dry my car now as opposed to old bath towels and chamois cloths No streaks, goes on easy and comes off clean.  Microfiber towels to wipe off the excess, leaving your car's glass spotless.  Highly recommended. I am amazed at how much water these towels will absorb and when I dry my car, it leaves it streak free.  The waffle weave design of this towel holds a remarkable amount of water when I'm drying my car. After washing my car, I squeegee off the excess water and then I used the water magnet towel. I can dry the entire car to perfection and never have to wring out the towel. I only occasionally wash this towel and only with plain laundry detergent that contains no fabric softeners or additives.  I consider this to be my prize drying towel. 
Doesn't take much per bucket, so this will last me quite a while, especially with my tiny smart car.Does a good job cleaning, as others have said, little residue so it rinses well and with a chamois dry, leaves the finish looking very good.And doesn't "funk up" your washing mitt and other washing accessories as some other products I've used in the past did. Yes it is a water magnet;however like another reviewer said, it's so magnetic where it won't let the water go no matter however many times you wring it. Sure drops will come off, but the potency of drying will not be at 100% as if the towel was completely dry. I would recommend a chamois or an absorber, they seems to wring out water alot better as well as soak water up. Just figure out a technique. And victory will be yours. So the case of the drying water magnet, I'll give it a four since it does what it's title says. And a bit easier to use than the chamois. But you get what you pay for. If you need to fill in light scratches or pinholes in filler then this will work great. Dries quickly (if not too thick) and sands easily once dry. If you try to sand it before it is dry, it is going to clog up your sandpaper but once dry it sands well. Easy to use and minimal shrinkage. 
I was suprised how well and how easy they worked even on an extended van.  It saves wear and tear on the shoulders. How can one really rate it, as it is used for protection and no idae how long it should last, yet is was as listed so I give it the benifit ogf the doubt... I required an ammonia-free window cleaner for my tinted windows. This does the job quite nicely. It isn't how well it does, rather how safely it does it. 
Clever item. You can push all your refrigerator items back and hold them there while traveling. To lengthen, you have to unscrew the upper and bottom rod. Then you have to twist them while holding in place in the fridge to tighten them. Bought this along with a No Spill 5 gallon can to use for track days. THe length is excellent and gets down into the filler of your car. It also fits in a 1 gallon freezer bag so you can seal it up and put it back in the trunk when done without smelling gas or getting it on your trunk carpet. Two improvements would make this a 5 star funnel. 1) It should be slightly upturned at the opening to catch gas as it backs up 2) The diameter of the nozzle should be larger and it easily could be given the tank inlet size - would allow faster filling. doesn't hang very secure to under sink door, even when I gently put bag in or out I have to hold it with my other hand worried it will come apart 
Nobody else has mentioned it.  This is the K&N size for anyone who uses the Ford FL1A.  It also works in place of the Derale 13092. I used this pad to applyMeguiar's M10532 Ultra Cut CompoundandMeguiar's M20532 Ultra Finishing PolishusingMeguiar's G110v2 Professional Dual Action Polisher.The pad stayed on the polisher (hooks and loops system) and followed contours of my car's body well.  I only had one pad and had to wash it after using Ultra Cut Compound and before using Ultra Finishing Polish.  I attached the wet pad to the DA polisher and turned it on to spin the water out of the pad.  The pad did not fly off.I am very satisfied with this pad. Great product and works well. However the Manufacture as a limitation on the packaging of not for DA (dual action) sander/buffer. I called and they said it only applies to this cutting pad and not the Finishing pad.... With that said I have used the pad with a DA buffer.... They said it will not hold up. I have no problem with it on a Porter-Cable DA. 
This towel cuts drying time in half. This is all I use to dry my car now as opposed to old bath towels and chamois cloths It's amazing how well these things work. Seriously. One towel is always enough for me to completely dry my car after a washing, and I think I only end up ringing out the towel once during the entire drying process. Just absolutely amazing. So if you're one of those people drying off their car with old towels...STOP! And get a couple of these instead. I was prepared to write a &#34;sham-why&#34; review because initially this thing acted like a sheet of nonabsorbent rubber, but once it started soaking water it seemed to 'open up' and began working pretty well.  It wrings out easily and leaves no lint, which is pretty rad,  because the old bath towels I was using before made my car fuzzy. 
Have used a California Duster for over 15 years on brand new and old car finishes, from black to white. This duster keeps a relatively clean, maintained car looking show room shiny and takes only minutes to use. How many things out there can give you a spiffy shine in a couple of minutes?The key to using the Duster is to follow the clear instructions provided. You MUST let it dry out a day or two before initial use. It has a waxy coating on the fibers (all the more reason it DOES NOT scratch the finish) and it has to dry out before initial use. Have read a couple of reviews that claim the Duster scratches, but suspect it is because they didn't let it dry out. The one time I forgot to do that, it looked liked it scratched (scared the daylights out of me!), but it was just swirls on the surface from the moist wax - easily removed. And, if there is moisture on the car's surface, it too will look like a swirl or scratch until it dries.Second, it is is a DUSTER, NOT a scrub brush. Only to be used on finishes that are otherwise clean but have dust/pollen on them. If you scrub with it to remove mud, splotches, bird droppings, etc., it WILL scratch, just as dry rubbing a car's finish with ANYTHING will scratch it. You let the Duster do the work, lifting the dust right off the car. Doesn't just push it around, but actually lifts it off.Maker claims it only gets better with time and dirt, but of course can't figure out how that could be true. BUT, have never noticed any problem with use and dirt accumulation. Tried washing once, which maker says you can do, but seems to remove the waxy coating and defeats the effectiveness. Ya, it may last forever, but I buy a new one once a year - hey it's pretty inexpensive.Be the envy of neighbors, get one of these and be as amazed as they will. Works just as described.  It does well by giving me a surface to loosen the dirt off my car cleaning brush, and it also allows the dirt to filter through and go to the bottom of the bucket.  Very tough also, a few times I have thrown the water out of the bucket after I'm done only to see the guard launched across the driveway - no harm to it, and just rinsed it off for the next use. Here in Texas our cars don't get that dirty, however this soap does a great job getting what dirt we do get off. 
This does not only protect, but cleans stains, road film etc. off the paint and bring its to nice clean shine. My cars have ranged from light colours (white and silver) to darker colours (red and blue) and this works perfectly to clean and protect. Sometimes, depending on how dirty the paint was,  2 applications would be done to restore the finish. Safe on clear coats and glass this is perfect. Also, one heavy shower does not remove the wax. Give it a try. This product was used on a silver car with paint in good to very good condition (some swirl marks, no chips or sun damage).It did cause the paint to shine more than without it and was enough that it will be in my regular routine.For this I used a clay bar first, then this polish, then three applications of the NXT wax and the car looks great. removes fine scratches, not anything deep into the paint.  But gets out minor scrapes and scratches.  Put a coat of wax on the area after using this product and it will shine beautifully. 
PROS:Tied to my Travel Trailer Battery to connect to my Solar Panel Charger.Quick Connect/Disconnect means you only mess with the terminals once, when you put this on the battery.Keyed so you don't create a short (Though be CAREFUL to orient it correctly on the battery posts).CONS: None. A car we store for the winter in an un-heated garagehas the battery go dead with-in a month .And a couple of times the parasitic drain ruined a cell/battery.So we bought a Battery Tender for that issue.One doesn't need to be versed about an automobileor a BT to use one and solve a variety of problems.It's a worry free ~ wonderful product that completely monitors itself.You can leave it hooked up for weeks or months etc.All though you ought to check on it every once in a while.The cab light in our truck was left on overnight & wouldn't startthe BT restored it enough with-in two hours to turn the motor over.A battery must have at least 3 volts left or the BT won't initiate chargingThen your down to jumping it, if the battery isn't yet ruined.The cords of the Battery Tender Plus are ~Electric cord (box to outlet) 6 ft 2"longCable that clips to a battery (with clips attached - box to battery) 7 ftGiving a possible continual length of over 13 ft.If that's not long enough, the 25 ft BT extension is economicaland our experience is that the BT is just as effective weather the ex is used or not.Footnote: A warning in the instructions say ~ quote1. "If the positive battery post is connected to the vehicle chassis,then the vehicle has a positive ground system.2. If the negative battery post is connected to the vehicle chassisthen the vehicle has a negative ground system.(Most systems are negative)3. For negative ground systems connect the positive alligator clip to the positive battery post.4. Then connect the negative alligator clip to the vehicle chassis."Then it goes on to state several areas NOT to connect to.This language has always worried me what exactly was the right thing to do here.So I phoned Deltran Corp and asked.They said they have to state that to protect themselves butthat it's fine to hook both clips to the two appropriate terminals of the battery.I must say here that the folks at Deltran are very accessible ~ knowledgeable ~and offered comparison information between the BT Jr verses the BT plus ~ cheerfully.I was impressed with their customer service. The Battery Tender Alligator clips allow me to charge a battery without having to install the ring type terminals on the positive and negative posts.  I can also charge a battery without having to remove it from a vehicle or removing the cables from the battery.  A very handy item to use with my Deltran 4-bank charger. 
I highly recommend these mirrors. I did a lot of looking and comparing before I bought these. I have a 2006 Toyota Tacoma and these things fit well and do a real nice job. They vibrate a little but not excessive. The little bit of vibration I see doesn't interfere with my view. I also do not extend them very far. The further out you go with them the more they will vibrate. Just extend to the minimum needed in order to be able to see.Before attaching to the vehicle I think it's a good idea to loosen the three screws holding the swivel in place on the bottom of the mirrors and work in a drop of oil. Then do not over tighten these screws. They don't have to be very tight to hold the mirror still and not over tightening allows easy adjustment later. If you find they move when you close the door you can tighten a little more but to start off, finger tight with the screwdriver is all you need. I also placed a couple drops of oil on the aluminum sliding bar and worked it in before attaching. Also, when you bolt the mirror onto the aluminum slide bar, grip the base (the part with the internal threads) with a vise-grip or something (not too tight to crush it), then make sure the lock nut is between the bolt and the bar on the bottom, and then screw the bolt into the base (and through the aluminum slide bar) nice and tight without letting the base turn. You'll notice there are &#34;teeth&#34; on the bottom of the base. These are supposed to sink into the bar as you tighten the bolt. They keep the base from turning when you adjust the mirror. This is another good reason to not overtighten the three screws around the swivel. You want to be able to adjust the mirror from side to side and have it turn only at the swivel and without causing the base to turn against the aluminum slide bar.The bracket will bend the weather stripping on the outside of the window a little. It springs back when the mirror is removed but some of it will be permanent. It's not a big deal and you'll just have to deal with this if you want to use these mirrors. It is not a detriment to the operation of the window.I installed them as far forward as possible so that the top of the bracket was parallel to the ground and the new mirror sits right beside my existing one towards the outside. Tightening the ratchet by hand produced plenty of tension to hold it securely. Releasing the ratchet is another matter. It's too tight to just push it down with your finger. To release the tension I use a short piece of rope and loop it under the sliding buckle. Then I stand right next to the truck with the rope looped around one hand and my other hand on the ratchet release tab. I use my body leverage (knees and back) to pull upward on the rope a little which takes just enough pressure off the belt to allow me to press the ratchet release tab. You don't need to back the ratchet off very far - just enough to get the hook out from under the door. Then just close up the bracket and wrap up the belt around it and you're all pre-set for the next time.For better stability I advise when you're adjusting the belt, place the sliding buckle as necessary so that the crossbar forming the angle is not extended very far, if at all. And, yes, make sure there isn't any dirt behind the buckle or you'll get a scuff mark.You should have the windows all the way down when attaching to the vehicle. The bracket comes close to the window so you need to be careful not to let it scratch the window. After you get the mirror on I advise to raise the window very slowly to make sure that the metal bracket is not contacting (scratching) the window as you raise it. Once you're under way - be sure not to lower the window if there is any sand or debris laying on the bracket right next to the window or a scratch may occur from this action also. I've taken these off and on several times now and we've travelled with them and I've been relatively careful and have never had one scratch my window.On my truck, the doors fit really well and I can tell the difference when the hook for the mirror strap is hooked under the door. The door fits just a tad more tightly than usual. It has to be closed just a slight bit harder to make the latch engage and when I open the door it pops out ever so slightly because of the extra tension produced by the hook being in there on the bottom. I don't see this as a problem. The mirrors are not on there all the time and, even if they were, I think the latch mechanism on the Toyota is stout enough to handle it without any long term problems developing. Just be aware that the hook will slightly change thge way the door latches.The instructions are good, too. Not the usual loosely translated Mandarin. I've tried to supplement here with my own experience. Didn't realize it didn't come with the wiring harness and instead must cut and splice to the original wiring. But there is no way a normal human being can undo the harness anyway. It's behind the manifold where you can barely reach with one hand from the top. There is no way possible to reach it from underneath unless you start unbolting some suspension parts. So I guess this cut and splice model was the way to go. The bad part is you have to do all the splicing while under the car.I haven't installed it yet because the instructions are sort of unclear as to the correct color of the wires. After I got my CV from the auction, I ordered some fancy new headlight bulbs for it. They did NOT come with aiming instructions, which seems silly, if you ask me (but, who asked me, right!).If you've ever searched the web for headlight aiming instructions, good luck! No two are alike! I contacted the manufacturer of the bulbs, and even they had vague instructions. This is the best explanation I found: [...]Step one ... put some gas in the tank. The adjustment will fluctuate a little depending on how much gas you have in the tank (yes, I did it on empty the first time and had to re-adjust the height.), and other load/spring/shock conditions.On a flat surface, you drive the car as close as you can up to a wall and mark the center of the headlight beams. This varies from bulb to bulb, and can range from a well defined rectangle, to a somewhat defined "top," and a vague "bottom." Some bulbs have a kind of a "z" that you align where is zigs and zags.Now, back your vehicle up 25'. This is an "industry rule of thumb," not a mystery, as some manufacturers may have you believe. My lights were shining on the ground at this point, waaaay off!On the back of your lights are little screws with 4 mm hex heads. The top ones towards the outside of the car are for up and down, the lower ones, towards the inside of the car, are for left and right. I tried pliers ... no good, I tried that little crescent wrench ... no good, I went to Sears and bought that pretty miniature set of metric wrenches that goes down to 4 mm for $20 (what was I thinking) ... and I was actually able to do some adjusting by turning and turning the wrench, back and forth, back and forth, dropping it into the frame ... (you know what I'm talkin' 'bout!) ... I did discover (if you're short of cash and have a little wrench already) that by taking the yellow bulb assembly out of the headlight, that the little wrench will spin around without taking it off the post.Since my daughter and I both have these cars, I decided to look for a "real" adjustment tool and found this Lisle product. WOW! Now, I can do BOTH headlights, up and down, AND, right and left, in the time it took me to do one screw before! This thing fits perfectly, it ratchets smoothly, and you can pop it on and off easily! It's like a miracle tool! NOTE TO SELF!!! DO "NOT" BACK THE ADJUSTER SCREW ALL THE WAY TO THE METAL PANEL BEHIND IT WITH THE TOOL ON THE SCREW! THE TOOL WON'T COME OFF AND YOU CAN'T REVERSE THE TOOL OTHER THAN TO REMOVE IT FROM THE SCREW AND TURN IT AROUND! And, no, I didn't actually do this, but I came darn close!K, I digress, sorry about that! Now, you have your car backed up 25' from the wall, hood open, radiator access panel removed (there's a little thumb screw you turn if you're lucky). Lights on "low beam," then cover one of the lights with a dark towel or something, and it will be easier to see the light you're working on.Vertical adjustment (up and down) ... At this point there are several variations of "the rule." I have found on my car that aligning the "top" on the headlight pattern at, or just below, the horizontal centerline for the lights that I marked on the wall is good. This is pretty easy to see for any of the bulbs that I have been using.Horizontal adjustment (side to side) ... This varies a lot! The recommendations in the link in this post has you align the "driver's side" of the beam rectangles (this varies from aligning the centerline of the beam rectangles to two inches to the right of the centerline in some recommendations, and various other recommendations), just up to the vertical centerlines that we marked on the wall. IF you can actually see a definite outline of the beans, this might work. On one car, the beams are defined, on the other I can NOT see a defined left or right edge on the wall, so I had to "play it by ear" and eyeball the adjusters so as to not get them too far in or out, erring on what I thought to be aiming the beams more to the passenger side of the centerlines. Keep in mind that the goal is to illuminate the shoulder, passenger side of the road, the lane you are traveling in, and, I believe, to illuminate somewhat, the oncoming lane without blinding the other driver.Commonsense, and a test drive will tell you if you have it right. If the street signs are glowing like the sun from a mile down the road, you're aimed too high! A quick check of the high beams while in front of the wall may verify your aim. You do NOT adjust high beams, they are supposed to be "self-aiming" when the low beams are aimed, however, they should be somewhat centered over those centerlines we marked earlier.The glory of this tool was then, when I did the test run with the radiator access cowling off already, and I could see the beam was too far towards the driver's side (middle) of the road, I just pulled off the road, opened the hood and popped the adjusting tool on the screw, easily flipped it a few turns (you will know which way after you adjust it a few times) and it came out perfect!Please verify all information, this can be dangerous for everyone if it's not done correctly. Safe driving! 
You have to have this. Mounts most typically on the outside of the RV.. Just tilt the outside door/vent open and Olsen the peacock valve. No tools required!  Very cool! Can place inside the fill tube and walk away - didn't come shooting back out against the water pressure.  Only complaint is that it is a little long where the threaded portion connects with the hose.  Had to install another rubber gasket to get it to stop leaking. This works very well for blowing out water supply lines in an RV's plumbing system.  Be aware that there can be water still in the lines even after blowing out air through every faucet, so when winterizing, it can't hurt to use a RV safe antifreeze just to keep the water at the low spots (elbows, valves) from freezing. 
connected two of these cables to charge my battery on my truck / battery charger unit is in garage works perfect. Works as intended, easy to plug in and charge the motorcycle batteries.I double checked with volt meter at the end of charging and was at proper voltage I got a power plug to power plug style &#34;jumper&#34; device for my daughter, in case the 12V battery on her Prius dies.  Since the Prius doesn't use the 12V battery to start the motor, she doesn't need real jumper cables.  However, it's a keyless ignition, so she will not be able to jump power plug to power plug.  The battery on the Prius is has small terminals, so these are a nice size and should do the job of getting power from someone else's light to her battery. 
No more "nagging" to close the screen door! You could probably buy a spring at your local hardware store for about the same price, but the pre-determined install tension (distance to drill holes) and where to mount the spring(s) makes it well worth the $7. I followed the instructions for screw hole distance and only needed 1 spring. Both springs may pull the door past the latch at rest (without door swinging closed), but a normal entry/exit the single spring has enough to overcome the latch without slamming the door. The hitch pin locks are wonderful.  High quality, durable, and weather proof.  But if I had to do it over, I might just buy the pin locks (Master Lock Key Alike Set with Receiver and Coupler Latch Locks, 2-Piece Set #2848DAT) without the coupler lock.  First of all, the coupler lock doesn't really deter someone from stealing your RV trailer if they are determined.  You can simply connect the chains to a vehicle and drive off or just cut the coupler lock off.  I use the claw for real security (Tire Claw XL Lock #491KA - ATV, Auto, Trailer Locks).  Therefore, the only thing the coupler lock does is deter the casual thief if you don't use the claw.  The ball is grey plastic with a steel inner, which should work well.  I find that when it's in place, it hangs down and looks kind of floppy.  I may just end up using the hitch pin locks and claw only and forget the coupler lock. I highly recommend these mirrors. I did a lot of looking and comparing before I bought these. I have a 2006 Toyota Tacoma and these things fit well and do a real nice job. They vibrate a little but not excessive.

Installed on a motorcycle works great.  Cord included allows for permanent install and can be used for accessories when not charging.  Great price. I need to keep my Vette breathing so I purchased this!  Recommended by many Vette owners.  This will work on any platform that requires a charge.  Thanks again! this is a very helpful tool that comes in handy when you think a spark plug has failed and isnt fireing and with this tool you wont have to wounder if the plug is bad or not and is worth buying and i recomend this tool to all do it yourselfers and mechanic shops as well thank you 
Sure the switch placement sucks,but I do like the pump overall.I can plug in to a 120 outlet or use the 12 volt car accessory outlet. I need this pump for every 100k miles when I change differential oil. There are two holes: bottom one is for oil drain and the top bolt is for oil fill. I use this pump to pump Gear oil using the top fill hole up to the point that oil will sip out. I don't think I can do it without this pump. USES: MMO can be used in a car to clean out the entire fuel system, including the fuel pump, and fuel injectors. On an older vehicle, this can also clean out your carburetor, which normally can become troublesome with age. Like I said earlier, MMO is also a trade secret to those who race cars, many will swear by this product.MMO can also be used in RV's, which use diesel engines or the big rigs as well. It can also be used in, boats, ATV's, and landscaping equipment such as, mowers, trimmers, blowers. I also like MMO, cause it can be used in the oil crankcase of every engine. Over time, your engine can develop carbon deposits, having MMO in the crankcase will clean out these deposits. Then you can get rid of them at your next oil change.MY EXPERIENCE: My experience with MMO has been well, marvelous! I have been using it in my landscaping equipment for years now. And I find that machines, which I am treating with MMO, last longer then those that are not treated. For example, I can run MMO in the gas and oil of a Briggs V-Twin engine. I can then have another duplicate engine next to it without the MMO treatment.I can run both engines for 48 hours, and I can guarantee you, if I pull them both apart, the engine which was treated with MMO, will be the cleanest one. Another difference is with valve lifter ping, I am sure you have heard that from your engine before. Treat your engine with MMO, and I can guarantee you that the ping will go away. Why? Because, MMO cleans and lubricates your valve lifters.THE MANTIS TILLER: As some of you may know, I used to own a 2-cycle Mantis tiller. Well, after it was 3-years old, I was having some major troubles with it. What it needed was a carburetor rebuild kit, but since I was on the job, I had no time for that! I grabbed my bottle of MMO, which I bring with me, I applied two cap-fulls of this stuff to the tank. After running the engine at full throttle for 10-minutes, all of the sudden I gained engine power. And I was able to sustain smoother throttle response as well. 
Great wheel lock that is easy to activate and unlock.  It comes with 3 keys, one of which has a LED light on it.  The product also comes with a reminder cord that attaches to the handle bar as a reminder.  It does just what I was looking for. Basically, this is a voltmeter, similar to a hand-held VOM, and designed to read static voltage and the voltage being pushed to the battery from the alternator as the engine revs ... automobile or motorcycle (having a 12v socket).  The cigarette lighter convenience is what attracted me ... I don't have to juggle a meter and wires with my head under the hood or standing alongside the bike trying to rev it and hold wires and meter, etc.  Tested it already and it seems dead-on with readings at or just a tad under what the hand-held shows.  It's coming on to winter and it's nice, when checking fluids and tire pressure, to do periodic checks on the charging system so you don't get that gut-dropping &#34;click-click-click&#34; when you turn the key in some dark, empty parking lot somewhere you don't want to be! Well made. I like the quick disconnect harness that comes with this unit. Brings battery to full charge and switches to maintenance level. 
The Tender Jr. does not come with a cigarette adapter so I cut this in half to make two. I purchased 2 lighter plugs for a buck each from China&#8230; with free shipping&#8230; and they are working fine. These aren&#8217;t an exact match with the Tender cables but they fit together OK and are easy to determine polarity with the wire colors. You can also just use this as an extension cord for your Tender. The description states a length of 12-inches&#8230; but it&#8217;s actually 14-inches tip-to-tip on the connectors. Nice item for the price and it&#8217;s made in Mexico. Sizes listed in reviews and the two in the description (15.8 x 10.5 x 5, and 12.5 x 9.5 x 7) don't match to what I received...The bag I received is in between what has been listed in the descriptions:  13.5" x 9" x 6" (empty).While seemingly a good quality bag, with a fair amount of straps and attached rain-cover (hidden in the heel of the bag), it seems the manufacturer (or seller) has no idea how to use a measuring tape!The bag itself is quite nice... good padding, rubberized bottom to prevent sliding, small pockets on either side, and zippers seem of reasonable quality.For the price and bag quality, I'm not complaining.  It works great on my CB750, and it does fit on the pillion of my VT1100c2 (without having to remove my rider backrest)  So if you have standard seating (or a touring/adventure style), this bag will do well for you as a pillion bag, and with a little strap adjustments, it also fits vertical on the front or back of a sissy-bar, or horizontal on a larger luggage rack... Fits on my Hi-Lift jack just fine. Does exactly what it is supposed to do.If you are using it on wheels that are deep make sure the straps are long enough to reach the spoke pattern. 
its not a bad product. gets rid of dirt, just make sure you scrub the wheels to remove excess dirt as it doesnt get rid of ALL of the dirt from spraying Mr Gasket chrome hex valve stem cap worked fine on my car and look good. I left the valve a little loose and put the cap on to see if the cap would seal off the leak, and it did. Great. This is one of my favorite wheel cleaners. It cuts the brake dust and dirt with ease without damaging your wheels. Works well on any finish like including alloy, chrome and even black wheels.  All wheel cleaners are not created equal. This cleaner will clean very gentle so no damage occurs. 
I probably should compare it to another to see how accurate it is, but I really like how easy it is to use and turns off and on by itself. Before installing the level, make sure you are level with the camper first.  Also don't think that a top of one of the storage compartments is level because it isn't.  Once you put on the level, it is very hard to take off.  But I do like how it reads in inches.  It does make it easier to level the camper. Works well but hard to empty. No matter how hard I try, I always end up with some spillage. Otherwise it's good for quick and easy oil changes. Both my cars have top mount filter cartridges. So why go under the car? If I had a car that required me to go under, I'd probably just pull the drain plug instead. 
Mr Gasket chrome hex valve stem cap worked fine on my car and look good. I left the valve a little loose and put the cap on to see if the cap would seal off the leak, and it did. Great. This is absolutely one of the best oil filters for the price all metal end caps and silicone valves. It help them run longer. Also has a grip to hand tighten the filter. Used on a 2003 p71 crown victoria and works great with synthetic oil. This tool is perfect for solo bleeding brakes. All you do is attach it to a bottle/jar/container via some adapters and tubing and then bleed away without the fear of getting air back into the brake lines.The only tiny problem is that the tubing attached to the bleeder screw is a air tight one way check valve so when you take it off a large amount of brake fluid is trapped on the intake side of the tube and if your not careful may make quite a mess on the calipher. I wish they included some button on the tool to open the check valve fully to allow the excess fluid trapped in the tubing to flow downward into the container to minimize the chances to make a mess. 
would recommend getting a  size  smaller than  what the  &#34;sizing chart&#34; recommends  as  I  measure aroun my leg  as  recommended  and  the chaps  were  one size too large.. otherwise they are  awesome  quality and build The meter has all the functions you could ask for a multimeter in a compact size.  The digits are large for the size of the meter, so it's easily readable by middle aged eyes. This is one-size-fits-most. It works on the filter for my 2002 Volkswagen Passat, but it's too large to grip the filter on my 1993 Chevrolet S10. 
I'm a rock and roll fan from way back, but not when it comes to RVing.  These helped more than anything else in slowing down that rock and roll. In the past year or so, I have put these wipers on twocars,  a 2005 Toyota Sienna, a 2003 Mazda Prot&eacute;g&eacute;.  I have the Bosch version on a third car, and find these comparable. I find that the curvature of the glass makes a difference in the relative performance of the wipers,  on the Sienna, which has a pretty flat glass surface, they work a little better than the standard type wiper, but not much.  On the smaller cars, which seem to have more curvature near the top and bottom of the windshield, the contact is better across the whole swipe than with my regular blades.These are much easier to replace than the old style, the hardest part for me was getting the old ones off, I actually had to google the directions.  Honestly, the fact that these take less fighting with to get on is a big plus.They are more silent that the rubber versions, but I have found that on hard snow (the grainy stuff) they do not scrape as effectively, I think because they are more flexible.  On soft snow they work fine as well as on sleet and rain. I use it on Mustang and Elantra rims, custom ordered and factory stock. its a great all around wheel and tire cleaner, especially whe n coupled with mother wheel brush. they say its no scrub, but i think if you scrub it with a good wheel brush, its even better!!!!!!!!!!! 
I've not used this yet. I hope I never need to, actually. If I do, I will certainly update this review. :) I didn't know this was what was already on my car when I bought another to replace it. When removing the existing one I found moisture had made its way into the components inside, under the cap. I would take an educated guess that it was due to an inferior o-ring or bad vent cap. There was some oxidation on various parts and even some rust, which I've never seen in any other vehicles I've owned over the past 20 yrs. The matching rotor was a PITA to remove, which I will explain in the rotor review. I won't buy this or the rotor again. Don't know why others have problems with the RP diff oil but I have had it in my M3's diff for the past 30,000 miles and I have no complaints whatsoever. The oil that was in before made the diff whine at certain speeds and it was pretty noticeable. It did go away after I put the RP in and I haven't had any problems since. I love RP and use throughout my car from engine oil to diff oil I recommend it. 
I have a pair of these stands bought about a year ago and have put them to very good use.  These stands are light weight and very sturdy.  Got a second pair to add to my collection for tire rotation.  I'm planning to use a pair on each side when I'm working under the front of the vehicle to access the O2 sensors. They do a dang good job but you have too order two I just assumed they were sold in pairs like socks ? Wrong I mean who buys just one wiper blade if they were made to fit a Ford super duty F350 I bought this because Amazon suggested that it should be bought along with the brake controller. There is no need for it at all as the brake controller mounted just fine with the included hardware. 
These caps fit on top of the Tri Lynx levelers (Tri Lynx 00015 (10)  Lynx Leveler) or by themselves, for under stabilizer jacks or the hitch jack (if you have a light trailer).  They can also be used on top of the levelers, for under the tire(s) to level your RV.  I don't know how much weight they can bare, but they do well with my 3,400lb trailer for all of the uses described above. I grew up in the 80's so I remember well playing with Legos.  Building everying from cars to forts.  Well the Tri Lynx Comapny has brought us back our nostalic youth with Tri Lynx Levelers.  These are large square plastic pads (roughly 9"x9"x1" thick) that are stackable to just about any confgiuration you can imagine.  You can stack them in a "column" fasion for leveling jacks.  Or you can stack them in an offset alternating "brick wall" fasion for an interlocking leveler that is safe to drive on without fear of displacement.  They can even be stacked side by side for larger duel wheel RVs.  For my use, I wanted to use them for my leveling jacks and for pads were there was a side leaning tilt.  The box says to never stack more than 4 levelers high for a single configuration.  I've gone to 10 under my jacks and they still feel rock solid once pressure is put on them.I'm on my 4th set of Lynx levelers.  I'm convinced you can't have too many.  With that I fianlly invested in these "Stop'n Chocks"  Wonderful!!!  As I said these can be used under your wheels as well.  So the Stop n' Chalk stacks as the last piece at the rear of the Lynx configuration to allow the driver  just back up against them.  Now these are the most versitle set of leveling / chalking pads you can buy becasue they allow for front to rear leveling and side to side leveling.  If one side of the coach is lower than the other, you can build up just that side and use standard chalks on the other.  Also if you have enough of the Tri Lynx levelers you could potentially place say 2" of lift under a front axel on an tandem configuration and 4 or even 5" under a rear.  The one draw back is that you would need enough to building this as one continous pad (say 8' long or so.)  But like legos, if you have enough, your imagination is the limit.A couple of notes:  You MUST use these in conjunction with TriLynx levelers.  They will not work on their own.  In addition there is a noctch carved out of the front to force the user to stack in the above mentioned "brick wall" alternating fasion so that there's no risk of sepertaion between the levels as the rig is driving on or off the pad.  Also, I stongly suggest a spotter!  Driving a rig on or off a 9" wide "rail" is dangerous and having someone to tell you that you a little too close to the edge is a must. I have one of these jacks supporting the rear of my trailer in the driveway, it is rock steady even with four people in the trailer. I like it that these are light weight (steel jack stands can be quite heavy) and I like that these come apart easily and stack up into a compact set for storage.As far as using these for camping: hmmm. They are really too short for my camper, so I'll need to haul 2x6 pieces around to raise them up. Also, the head (the piece that touches the frame of the trailer) doesn't swivel well under load and can pop off of the frame while you are raising the stand. And the steel parts (the nut and the screw) aren't galvanized so they rust. 
I underestimate the size of this level (although it was stated in the specs): I was expecting a small bulls-eye level, around 1" in diameter. This thing is 4 times the size! But regardless, it works as it is supposed to. I've contemplated mounting it to our travel trailer via the screw-holes or double sided tape but haven't just yet. I want to make sure the thing will hold up to some weathered-use before I drill holes into a metal component. Not bad for &lt;$4 (at the time of this review). They are a bit slick and need to be sand blasted or something. I would not buy these for any Tire size 15 inch or smaller. Get a 4x4 , cut it, use it. This gauge works perfectly, always giving a correct reading and fits on the back tire of my Yamaha XJ650 no problem which is hard there isn't much room between the valve stem and the break drum.  Its small size allows me to carry it in my riding jacket pocket so I can check the pressure of my tires anywhere!  You can't go wrong with this gauge. 
After a power outage, I connected my refrigerator to this power supply. Sadly, its inverter was unable to support my refrigerator. The Duracell DPP-600HD doesn't have enough momentary  output to handle the initial start-up current spike of a refrigerator's compressor motor. The specifications say it can momentarily provide up to 960 watts. This equates to 8 amps at 120v.  Yet, public benchmark figures for a home refrigerator's start-up current indicate 13 amps for up to 1/2 second. Other appliances that use electric motors such as sump pumps are likely to exhibit the same characteristics. My suggestion is that customers immediately test this product with any device they intend to power during an outage.Some important specifications are missing in the Amazon listing.  One of the key statics is the capacity of the internal battery, which is 28 amp-hours at 12 v.  This equates to 336 watt hours.  Yet, AC output is much lower than this presumably due to inverter losses.  These losses increase with power output.  The following table illustrates this.  The last column is my calculation.load.................watts....hours....watt-hoursCordless telephone.....5........35.0 ...175Portable stereo.........10........22.0 ...220Laptop computer.......20........7.0 ....140Fan.......................100.........1.7....17036" TV...................133........1.2 ....1603/8 drill.................300........0.4 ....115Warm-air fan heater.312........0.4 ....109Blender..................385........0.3 ....109HID Floodlights.......400........0.3.....107Observe that the total energy delivered (watt-hour) drops with power consumption.  Ultimately, the usable energy is significantly less than what is contained within the lead acid battery.For reference, a refrigerator will use about 200 watts of electricity when the compressor is running. Typical consumers will have their refrigerator running about 50% to 60% of the time, which equates to an average of 100-120 watts being consumed continuously.ConsDoesn't handle current spikes associated with certain electric motorsProsBoth AC and DC outputPortableSimple operation Works as intended, easy to plug in and charge the motorcycle batteries.I double checked with volt meter at the end of charging and was at proper voltage 2002 Chevy Silverado 5.3L w/ 145 amp alternator, 206K miles. Very quiet in all conditions, very happy. Replaced at the same time as the water pump, radiator, pulleys, tensioner, and some other odds and ends, and the truck is running great. 
If the charging system is completely dead and the engine is running on battery voltage only, this monitor will display green (as in everything is okay) as it it goes into battery check mode.

Ordered this to put on top of my floor jack which was 3" diameter but it did not fit, it was just sitting on top loosely.  So I'm giving it 3 stars, if it fits your application, I'd imagine it would be rated highly.  So it's back to either a puck or wood for me.Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you, it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews, and leave a comment if you have any questions, I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help. This is a nice, sturdy guage to check spark plug gap.  However, it has only an inch scale, with no metric equivalent on the reverse side.  So if you plan on gapping your plug to a metric value, forget this guage.  Even so, it felt good to use and not at all flimsy.  It's smoothly finished and the marking are clear and legible, making it easy to read.  Well worth what I paid for it.PS. Another reviewer said the one he received had the metric markings on the back side.  I found no such markings on mine -- perhaps the one I received was defective.  In any event, that doesn't alter my rating.  I still like it. When ordering this ball I didn't realize the dimensions. I know they come in two sizes, but didn't realize how big it really is until I opened the amazon box today...no biggie, it'll still work. If your planning on doing rims or small areas, you should get the little guy! Great buy though....... 
The meter has all the functions you could ask for a multimeter in a compact size.  The digits are large for the size of the meter, so it's easily readable by middle aged eyes. It does get a bit warm while providing the 5 amps of power to the Koolatron car cooler (which I took into hotel rooms at night), but it did exactly what it was supposed to do so can't complain. One issue: There are two different sizes for so-called "cigarette lighter" outlets. This has the "big" size, which means "small" size plugs can have issues. Solution if that is a problem for your particular plug is simply to use a toothpick to "shim" the small-size plug into the large-size socket. would recommend getting a  size  smaller than  what the  &#34;sizing chart&#34; recommends  as  I  measure aroun my leg  as  recommended  and  the chaps  were  one size too large.. otherwise they are  awesome  quality and build 
The battery was dead.  Dead dead.  Apparently being parked for months without use, the clock and the alarm slowly killed my battery.  But this thing brought it back from the other side in short time.  Very pleased. If you ride every day or once a month you need this product. It will save you from having to call a tow truck, cold cranking problems in the morning and buying a battery every time you ride after a long winter. The battery is brand new and barely used.  I bought a battery tender to keep the battery charged, because of the lack of use.  The Battery Tender Jr topped off the charge within 15 to 30 minutes the first 4 times I used the tender.  Then the fifth time, the tender charge light stayed red.  I phoned Deltran to discuss.  The first person interrupted my first sentence to tell me it takes up to 72 hours to charge.  I tried to tell her how I don't use the battery, and about the 4 previous charges taking only minutes, and suddenly #5 was different, but she kept innterrupting me to lecture me that I had to let her finish talking.  No clue how she could provide usable information, since she didn't let me explain what has happened.  After she went on lecturing excessively about letting her talk, I finally asked for another technician, who was excellent.  I did a couple tests with her on the phone, and, while the indicator light passed the functionality test, it stayed red when connected to the battery.  One thing I learned was that, after two hours, the charger should have been hot, and it was only warm to the touch.--Later:  My brother tested the charger, and it is not giving power.  Battery is fine.  Amz's return policy expired two months after the purchase, so I emailed Deltran to see about getting it replaced.  Haven't heard back yet. 
excellent price and how much easier it was to install, just get the right wrench and you're ready to go,  Easy to replace also. this chock is a great design ..... light and easy to operate; no rust or corosion; easy on the tires too I was suprised how well and how easy they worked even on an extended van.  It saves wear and tear on the shoulders. 
Sizes listed in reviews and the two in the description (15.8 x 10.5 x 5, and 12.5 x 9.5 x 7) don't match to what I received...The bag I received is in between what has been listed in the descriptions:  13.5" x 9" x 6" (empty).While seemingly a good quality bag, with a fair amount of straps and attached rain-cover (hidden in the heel of the bag), it seems the manufacturer (or seller) has no idea how to use a measuring tape!The bag itself is quite nice... good padding, rubberized bottom to prevent sliding, small pockets on either side, and zippers seem of reasonable quality.For the price and bag quality, I'm not complaining.  It works great on my CB750, and it does fit on the pillion of my VT1100c2 (without having to remove my rider backrest)  So if you have standard seating (or a touring/adventure style), this bag will do well for you as a pillion bag, and with a little strap adjustments, it also fits vertical on the front or back of a sissy-bar, or horizontal on a larger luggage rack... GM has two different coils for this vehicle so their fit index isn't correct. One wire set is an 1.4 inches shorter. See other reviews for info. With the right part, they went right on and work as intended. The size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous. The funnel is 10" long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6" long. It states that the funnel is 4" x 4" but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2-1/4" in diameter at the widest point.It would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless.

IT WORKS Thank you They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. 
IT WORKS Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.  The pickle fork is the last resort for me, as it will damage the balljoint boot.I prefer to use the Snap On balljoint remover.  If that one cannot fit, then I will try this tool.  If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork. Exact replacement from OEM. Exact fit worked perfect . Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs.

My son suggested I get the whole K&N system but I opted for the factory style replacement filter instead. O.K., I am cheap...lol.  I installed this in my 2010 f150 5.4 litre FX2. I keep the avg.mpg readout on in my dash. I average 17.4 and I don't drive it hard. After the filter, I average 18.1. I was shocked and I am very pleased with these results. I love this unit. Now I know in detail what's wrong with my car before I take it to the shop. This lessens the opportunity that the shop will try to upsell me on a service that I may not need. I also like the idea of being able to log the issues on my computer.

Item works as described, saves crooks from sealing your gas. Key works smoothly in cap and with a turn its uocked This works. Sort of... and with problems.  First of all, it will pump up your tires, but don't expect to set the gauge and top up all 4 tires accurately to the preset PSI.  I had to unplug the unit and then reset the shutoff limit between the first and second tire and again between tires three and four.  Checking with a gauge after, only tires two and three had the same PSI and were within one pound of the preset shutoff limit.  Tire one was too high and tire four was too low.  Be careful not to jam the nozzle onto the valve stem all the way or else you may snap off the locking tab trying to close it, or the rubber gasket may stay stuck to the stem threads.  The whole unit has a flimsy seal to it.  The light works and would be handy if you needed the unit at night.  The flashing red light is pretty much useless.  It is too dim to stand out in the glare of oncoming headlights; it can't be used if you are using the clear light to pump up your tire. Your hazards are much brighter, but if they didn't work, what are the odds that your car will have the power to light this red flashing light?None of these type of units will compare to the air hose at the service station or a real air compressor, but for emergencies and occasional use they generally work pretty good.  You should have a good quality pressure gauge in your vehicle at all times anyway to help keep all your tires at the same pressure, so the built in gauge on this may not be a deal breaker for you. This unit works reasonably well and the light comes in handy if inflating a tire in the dark, or even if you need a light to change a tire. The gauge and shutoff preset I wouldn't depend on.  For a similar unit with similar features and price (and an analog gauge and shut off that really works) I would recommend this one instead:Campbell Hausfeld RP3200 12-Volt Inflator and Worklightor if you don't need the light or gauge, this one:Campbell Hausfeld RP1200 12-Volt Compact Inflator There are better choices in air compressors than this unit. I don't like the fact that the digital gauge stops working after it reaches the preset pressure.  The unit must be unplugged and plugged in again to get the gauge working again.  Also, the gauge is not very accurate.  The compressor takes too long to inflate my car tires to the correct pressure (32psi). It may be good for light duty stuff like pool floats and the like but it is not powerful enough to inflate auto and truck tires. This may be a good compressor to leave in the car for emergencies but there are better choices. I purchased this Campbell Hausfield compressor for under $20 several years ago and it is still working great (but it doesn't have a pressure gauge):Campbell Hausfeld RP1200 12-Volt Compact Inflator 
At less then $10 this is a steal!  The unit is well made and really does a nice job.  It's far bettter then the round adapter that plugs straight in and that on the back side you plug in the 30 amp cord.  The 90 degree 15 amp plug emliminates the problem of the cord pulling out or partially disconnecting from the outlet. this piece fits on the battery on your car/truck/bike and connects to cable from battery tender, have this on all my equipt,toys for quick hook up. The 3rd generation powerprobe includes a number of changes for additional flexibility.  In short, it is a vehicle powered DVM with both a 20 foot cable and an additional 20 foot extension giving you a 40 foot working range around either the battery terminals or cigarette lighter outlet, both clips and a plug are included in the kit.With the series 3 units they use a hard gold plated banana jack to hold the removable probe or cables to extend your reach.  If you purchase the accessory kit, it includes piercing probes that self center on a conductor, pierce the insulation, and attach to the jack allowing you to tap a wire at any point to locate intermittant problems.While the DVM is backlit all the time, it also has 2 bright white LEDs facing forward to aid in finding and probing terminals in dark places.  The actual probe is hardgold plated with a sharp tip and removable at the banana jack.  Another identical probe is included with a screw-in female banana jack in the accessories kit to retrofit the powerprobe I and II units to accept external cables and probes.If you need to excite a circuit with a connection to battery ground or to battery positive, the switch allows a momentary connection to bridge the probe tip to either voltage which is useful in testing relay driven circuits, indicator lights, and other small current loads.  The prope voltage is always displayed during testing on the meter. The voltage/ground switch is circuit breaker protected in case you accidentally drive 12 volts into a chassis ground.  Additionally, since the switch takes abuse it is easily replaced if it fails with just a screwdriver.Combined with the testlead set, the powerprobe 3 greatly simplifies testing of vehicular wire and big rigs up to a single trailer.  The DVM has 5 selectable modes of operation designed for different problems.  Reading the manual is important to get the full value from this meter.Although the price is a little high, the design and construction quality are excellent.  Enough wire is provided to check running lights on trailers or to look for blown fuses.  All of the wiring is exceptionally flexible and heavily insulated with top quality connectors.  Both the tester and accessories come in hard plastic cases that can be stowed in a service box.Not mentioned in specifications is that although the probe runs from 12-24 VDC, the meter can be used to measure voltages up to 80VDC. 
I underestimate the size of this level (although it was stated in the specs): I was expecting a small bulls-eye level, around 1" in diameter. This thing is 4 times the size! But regardless, it works as it is supposed to. I've contemplated mounting it to our travel trailer via the screw-holes or double sided tape but haven't just yet. I want to make sure the thing will hold up to some weathered-use before I drill holes into a metal component. Not bad for &lt;$4 (at the time of this review). When I ordered this, I was guaranteed fitment on a Toyota 3S-FE engine. When it arrived, it was not the correct size. i left two stars because I did run out and buy the correct size from another store, however, I didnt want to have to do this when I had all the rest of my parts shipped in. Not a complaint one.  It fit right into the hole where the old broken one was.  Not sure I like the idea of the &#34;flippers&#34; on the back as I had to cut those out so my cord end would fit through.  Other than that, I will definitely purchase again as needed. 
A number of reviewers have commented that the accuracy of this gauge is 0.1 psi.  It isn't.  The accuracy spec is +- 0.5 psi +- 1% of the reading.  This means that the gauge could show anything between 34.1 to 35.9 for a tire actually filled to 35 psi.Long story short...don't believe that 1/10 digit number that's being displayed.  If there's a slight change in tire pressure, it'll show it, but the actual value can vary significantly from what's shown. After a power outage, I connected my refrigerator to this power supply.

My Optima yellow top AGM battery is rated for 15V charging so I thought this charger would be okay for it, but the charger I got puts out 15.5V!  I did find specs that say 15.6V "regulated voltage" is okay for "rapid charging" on my battery but they don't define what rapid charging means.  They do say with 15.6V to "charge until current drops below 1 amp" which I think means you can do 15.6V until the battery gets closer to being charged and stops accepting high amperage.  Unfortunately this charger does the exact opposite, starting at lower voltage and increasing to 15.5V around when it decides the battery is at 90% charge (which seems to equate to about 12.6 or 12.7V on my battery).  The charger keeps outputting 15.5V until the battery is fully charged, which may take hours, so it seems unlikely that's good for most batteries and I'm pretty sure it's against the charging specs on my battery.  Note that the charger shows 15.4V on its readout but my volt meter shows it's actually 15.5V.Nevertheless I let it keep doing 15.5V and checked periodically to make sure the battery wasn't hot (it never even felt warm and an IR temperature gun read 86F max) and wasn't hissing (hissing would mean it was overcharged and releasing gas, permanently reducing its life).  It took almost exactly 12 hours for the charger to decide it was 100% charged and go into maintenance mode, but when it did, it picked 12.4V!  AGM batteries are supposed to be charged at around 13.6V for maintenance (float) charging, so I have no idea why it picked 12.4V.  I left it on for another hour and it actually reduced the voltage to 12.3, at which point I took it off the charger.  Volt meter said the battery was at 12.31V.I can't decide if this charger is broken, has a weird charging algorithm, or is actually very smart.  I say that because my battery was discharged to about 3.5V a few weeks ago, well below the voltage it's designed to be discharged to (it's a "deep cycle" but even deep cycles don't tolerate discharging below 50%, and even below 10.5V may hurt them), so it's now damaged and won't hold the full 13.6V it's supposed to.  Instead, if I leave it on the charger at 15.5V for an hour, it hits 12.8V and then quickly loses charge to 12.5V in about 30 minutes.  So maybe the charger somehow figured that out and decided that 12.4V was "full charge" on my damaged battery so that's what it used as its float charge.  I don't see how it could determine that if the battery was 12.8V or higher after the long 15.5V charge, but who knows.I also don't know if 15.4V is really bad for my battery, or for the "average AGM".  I spent awhile researching but couldn't find any real authoritative information, just a bunch of people theorizing.  Since it's above the 15V standard charge on the battery spec sheet I don't think it's a good thing, but then again I also found research (nrel dot gov/vehiclesandfuels/energystorage/pdfs/evs17pres.pdf) showing that seriously overvolting a yellow top battery to 17V under certain conditions actually increases its life.  So I don't know what to think, but I'm leaning towards thinking it's a bad thing to go against the manufacturer's spec sheet unless you're in a lab using specialized chargers.What I do know is that the desulfination feature on this charger didn't do a thing for my damaged battery.  In fact I don't think it even kicked in.  I connected the charger to a small sealed lead acid battery that I left unused for too long and it went into desulfination mode (I think - the manual doesn't say how you're supposed to know) for over 8 hours pumping 16.8V into the battery until it said "bad bat" on its screen and stopped charging.  In all that time the battery never showed over 15% charged on the charger, though it did end up holding about 10.9V.  In my online research it was mentioned in a few places that there are no studies showing desulfination actually works so I'm pretty dubious about it.  It definitely didn't work on either of my batteries.It was also interesting to note that the sealed lead acid battery never got warm, which I find rather curious considering how long it was putting in such a high voltage.  I had the charger connected to a kill-a-watt meter and it showed the charger was pulling only 0.15amps and 9watts, and this is in 2amp charging mode, so maybe the charger is smart enough to use low amperage when it's using high voltage and that prevents the battery from getting damaged.  When it was pushing 15.4V to my AGM battery it was only drawing 0.35amps and it actually reduced the amps to 0.29 as it got closer to 100% charged.  So maybe that protects the battery from overvoltage damage, but I don't know enough to be sure.  Maybe a battery expert will chime in in the comments.Another important thing to consider is that desulfination mode could damage your car's electronics if you don't remove the battery from the car to charge it.  16.8V is more than most cars were designed to handle, and I found someone mentioning that BMW warns not to use chargers that do things like that, so it's definitely a concern.  I don't know if I feel comfortable using this charger again without removing the battery from the car.  Some chargers claim to somehow magically detect the presence of car electronics and limit their voltage, but this charger says nothing about that in its manual.Other than all that, the design of the charger is nice.  Wires fit into a pocket beneath the retractable handle.  It will show you the battery voltage on its readout until you tell it to start charging (although it reads 0.1 to 0.2V lower than my volt meter, which is annoying).  A button lets you toggle between display of voltage or battery percent.  It lets you choose standard, AGM, and gel cell, and choose from three rates of charge.  The slower 2A charge rate is supposed to be better for many batteries, so use 2A or 6A if you aren't in a hurry.  I tried both those modes and it still puts out 15.5V in 6A mode but it puts out 15.3V in 2A mode.Since this is a dedicated 12V charger you don't have to worry about it "autodetecting" (actually, auto-misdetecting) your discharged 12V battery as a 6V and never charging it past 6V, which is a problem with far too many chargers these days.Despite its nice controls and smart form factor, I give this charger a low rating because I think it tries to push some batteries beyond their limits in the name of charging them as quickly or as fully as possible.  One reviewer said it caused his AGM to outgas and another said it burnt out his battery after a few months of trickle charge mode.  If you have the right brand of battery that can handle this charger's output, and your battery isn't damaged, it's probably fine, but the fact that it can damage things and may even damage car electronics in desulfination mode strikes me as very bad design, especially given that desulfination seems like more of a marketing ploy than a valuable feature.  I also don't like that its volt meter reads 0.1 to 0.2V under actual voltage. 
It does the trick - easy to use and not only gives the OBD2 code but also the name for the code so you have some idea of the problem before you research it.When I followed the web link through the software for more information, it asked for VIN and License numbers and had some 15+ diagnostic questions.  I was expecting a more complete analysis after going through all that, but found it wanted $9.95 for a more comprehensive report that would include possible causes and troubleshooting info, which you can find on other web sites through search engines.I would have liked the product to include a concise Quick-start guide, and for the users manual to include a list of codes and brief descriptions.  I didn't find the documentation to be user-friendly.If all you want is a tool to read the code, this is the tool for you.  To make the results useful, you'll need to research the code on the internet. Amazon really needs to check some of their cross reference charts. This does not it a 2011 Kia LX Sorento. Any tech should have one of this when recommending replacement of a customers tire. Some states require you have this for state inspection. 
Nice high amp (current) rating on this. I epoxy it to a 12ah  12 volt gel battery and I can use it as a jumpstarter oremergency power supply for camping or power outages. After a power outage, I connected my refrigerator to this power supply. Sadly, its inverter was unable to support my refrigerator. The Duracell DPP-600HD doesn't have enough momentary  output to handle the initial start-up current spike of a refrigerator's compressor motor. The specifications say it can momentarily provide up to 960 watts. This equates to 8 amps at 120v.  Yet, public benchmark figures for a home refrigerator's start-up current indicate 13 amps for up to 1/2 second. Other appliances that use electric motors such as sump pumps are likely to exhibit the same characteristics. My suggestion is that customers immediately test this product with any device they intend to power during an outage.Some important specifications are missing in the Amazon listing.  One of the key statics is the capacity of the internal battery, which is 28 amp-hours at 12 v.  This equates to 336 watt hours.  Yet, AC output is much lower than this presumably due to inverter losses.  These losses increase with power output.  The following table illustrates this.  The last column is my calculation.load.................watts....hours....watt-hoursCordless telephone.....5........35.0 ...175Portable stereo.........10........22.0 ...220Laptop computer.......20........7.0 ....140Fan.......................100.........1.7....17036" TV...................133........1.2 ....1603/8 drill.................300........0.4 ....115Warm-air fan heater.312........0.4 ....109Blender..................385........0.3 ....109HID Floodlights.......400........0.3.....107Observe that the total energy delivered (watt-hour) drops with power consumption.  Ultimately, the usable energy is significantly less than what is contained within the lead acid battery.For reference, a refrigerator will use about 200 watts of electricity when the compressor is running. Typical consumers will have their refrigerator running about 50% to 60% of the time, which equates to an average of 100-120 watts being consumed continuously.ConsDoesn't handle current spikes associated with certain electric motorsProsBoth AC and DC outputPortableSimple operation This little converter is a good deal for the price and will pull the current rating listed on it! So that's why I rated it a 5 star. 
Does what it says it does......looks great ! What can I say? It does what it says and I like the weight of it...makes it feel solid. I also like the LED light they put in so you can take the pressure in the dark/dim light. Pros: battery driven; flashing or steady light; flameless flare; can be used as a map light; reusable. Could be used effectively as a light that does not seriously degrade night vision.Cons: Product claims to be visible at 1000 ft, but this is only possible within a few degrees of view. One half of the top lights up for a dim presentation, but the bright LED shines out through a narrow beam like a small red flashlight. Consequently, the flare would probably not be useful in a traffic situation since it would have to be precisely aligned with oncoming traffic and would only be visible by the few drivers within this narrow beam of light. It is certainly not a good substitute for a real flare which is much brighter and omnidirectional. This little light is not as good as the emergency flashers built into vehicles.If you want a safety flare to carry in your vehicle, buy the real thing. If you want a light you can use as a map light without distracting a driver, or to see where you're walking without seriously degrading your night vision, this red light will do that well. 
These item does fit perfect on my 2004 BMW x3. does what its suppose to do. so far so good thanks Push it on the stem and you have an accurate pressure.  Milton is a quality product.  This straight chuck works great on duals.  Beats those small gauges. This digital gauge is easy to use and to read, even in bright sun light. It has a wide range so you can use it on high pressure tires.Alot of gauges only go up to 60 psi which is too low for load range E tires. 
I was looking for a digital tire gauge, I found the reviews on this one good, It is made of plastic but it feels high quality, the screen has big numbers, and is back-lit, it has a rubber grip for your hand, it also has a led light for taking measures at night, I'm glad a got it, highly recommend it! Although it is usually easy to spot a "bald" tire (i.e. one with virtually no tread), you cannot "eyeball" tire tread depth any more than you can "eyeball" the air pressure in your tires. Instead you need the right tool. Although this is one of the more expensive tire tread depth gages on the market, the quality of construction and ease of use justify the price, and definitely merit the five star ratings this product has received. Here is why I like it:1. This tool has a nice heft, is made out of nicely finished metal rather than cheap plastic, and comes with a hard shell foam padded case, which can easily fit into a glove compartment (the dimensions of the closed case in inches are 6 3/8 by 2 7/8 by 1 1/4). The quality construction is evident. This is a very well made tool, and looks better in person than in the picture.2. This is simple to use. Just loosen the lock screw, push the slide so the narrow point on the left is flush with the metal face, turn the unit on, press the zero button (or alternatively just adjust the slide until it reads zero on the digital display), choose whether you want mm, inches in decimals (tenths of an inch) or inches in fractions (64ths of an inch), put the metal face flush on the tire, push the slide from the "ruler" side until the narrow point reaches the bottom of the tread, and see the digital readout. The whole process takes just seconds.I like that you can simultaneously see the reading mechanically on the "ruler" part of the slide, which is marked in mm and 32nds of an inch. The new tires that I buy for my cars typically start at 10/32 of an inch (though this can vary depending on the kind of tire, so you need to check what the tread starts out as on whatever tires you are using). Therefore a reading of 5/32 for me means 50% of my tread is gone, at which point I usually replace the tire.3. Opening the battery compartment and installing the battery are simple. This product comes with the necessary battery (and in fact mine also came with a spare).4. The digital display is easy to read, and the digital reading remains on the screen until you either turn the unit off or "zero it out" to take another reading. Although I wear glasses, I can easily see the display even without them on. The digital display eliminates any guesswork as to the reading, though as noted above, you can also simultaneously look at a mechanical reading just to confirm the digital readout.5. I have my oil changed at a place that indicates the tread depth on each tire, but I bought this unit so that I could check myself between oil changes, and also verify the readings I am given. This tool easily and accurately lets me do that.Bottom line: If you like using quality tools that are easy to use and work effectively, then I recommend this product for checking your tire tread depth. This tool is handy for me to periodically check the wear on my tires, and is also useful for those who like to buy used tires, or are considering buying a used car and want to check the tire tread depth. I have a Wrangle-X but it's got the Rubicon wheel package so the tires are 255/75-17 (I don't know what all the numbers mean so I just post them all).  I bought the 2X size and it fits good, coming over the back side by about 2", feeling snug and secure.  I don't really see the "denim" look but at least it doesn't have the shiny look.  Material feels durable, should last pretty good. 
The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around! Does a super job on brass, copper, silver, aluminum, bronze and stainless steel. Polishes most metals to a mirror-like finish. Very similar to Flitz polishing cream. This product is pricy, but not as much as others that don't fit the bill as well.  Cruiser Accessories 76100 Tuf-Shield Clear Flat License Plate Cover is just that and a good product to use to simply and effectively cover your vehicle's plate with a protective clear plastic cover, while so many other immediately darken from exposure to the sun's rays, this one seems to stay clear. 
1. The viewing surface of the 8 inch mirror is exactly 7.5 inches wide and 2.25 inches high.2. I tried adjustment of the mirror without mounting it. The ball joints on the mirror arm are so tight that adjusting is extremely difficult to nearly impossible.  WD40 did not work, neither did working the joints around to loosen them up.3. So if you try to adjust the mirror after it's mounted, you risk stressing the mounting button glue and the button may fall off.4. When adjusting the mirror, the day/night button kept flipping on/off.  Very annoying.5. The mirror surface itself is very good, no ripples. The pair of levels are a great value.  I recently purchased these for a second time, as the originals were sold with my previous trailer and I wanted to make my new trailer easier to get on a level stance.There really isn't much to go wrong as far as product failure is concerned.  Accuracy is up to you with the initial installation.Recommended method of installation is to get your trailer level/RV, front to back, and side to side.  Once you have your trailer true, install the graduated levels in locations which will show you front to back level (placed on the side of the trailer) and side to side (place on the front or back of the trailer).  Make sure the bubble indicates "level" by being in the center point of the tube.Installation should be done once all your components are "stressed" as they will be for trailer/RV use (I.E. front tongue on a travel trailer, all the normal weight sitting on the winch foot, or in the case of 5th wheels/motorcoaches, landing gear down), try to place the levels on the RV in clear view of the winch/landing gear controls to enable leveling without having to relocate to a different location to view the levels.I accomplished this on a travel trailer by placing one level on the very front center, and the other on the side of the frame tongue close to the winch.  Though small, with sharp eye-sight, you can take advantage of the one on the front of the trailer as you position the trailer to see if you can establish a level side to side stance as you near your desired location.On my 5th wheel, my landing gear controls are on the front corner of the main body.  I placed one on the side of the rig for front to back level, and another right around the corner on the front side (for side to side level) still within sight of the controls, as well as from the truck cab for backing up.  Even though the level is off center, if it is installed properly with the trailer level at the time of installation, it will work fine.As far as the graduated scales are concerned, you will have to find your "scale" for adjustments, as it depends on where the levels are placed in reference to the center of the pivot points.The levels come with a self adhesive foam strip on the back for placement as well as two holes for screws if you wish to drill holes in the side of your rig.  I go with the adhesive strip route, as I don't like unnecessary holes.  The only negative with the adhesive strips is they will flex if stressed and it can put the levels off level, though this only happened to me with the first pair after the foam tape aged a few years.One last comment . . .the green bubble tube will fade from extended UV exposure.  It will not interfere with the accuracy, just makes it a little harder to read.If you are looking for larger levels which can be read from a distance, I know they are out there, but I have no experience with them to make a comparison.  I do not wish to clutter the appearance of the rig with large levels. Easy to mount and adjust. Since each one is made identical (there is no right or left, you just mount the mirror differently), one has the tensioner lever right next to the mirror (drivers side in my case). That is not a problem if you place it back from your mirror. Good sturdy mount and no vibration. Once adjusted they are easy on and off. 
Looks cheap.  The hooks sit out too far, so I don't feel comfortable leaving them hanging in the car...I don't want someone to accidentally snag themselves or hit their face on this in the back seat...especially with a child in the back. I purchased this for my 2005 Avalanche to use while I am towing my 28 foot camper.  Prior to having these all I could see behind me was my camper, now I can see any car that is behind me, it's a must have for anyone pulling a trailer that is difficult to see behind and is much better and more stock looking than the other mirror options out there. I work on my car A LOT.  Between changing wheels, to adjusting suspension, to detailing, cleaning, oil changing, the list goes on, I was in dire need of some sort of "chair" so that I wouldn't have to plop myself on the ground to get closer to eye level with what i am working on, or bend over when doing some detailing.  This creeper seat was JUST what I was looking for.  The seat is quite comfortable, and by having no back support it gives you a couple of different ways to sit on it so that you can find the most comfortable position when doing various things.  I have used it recently to do a quick winter detail of my car.  I was getting absolutely tired with doing my detailing with an orbital whilst bent over having to keep squatting and standing.  Now I dont have to worry about that since this seat literally puts me at the median line in respect to the height of my car.  The tray on the bottom also works PERFECTLY for holding on to polishes, pads, cloths, etc while the roller wheels help you move with ease.  I can't wait till the winter is over and I can switch out my winter wheels back to my summer ... this seat will be of a HUGE benefit since I will no longer have to sit on the ground and do all of the work.  Fantastic Price too! 
Received within 3 days. Saw Mythbusters do a test of these LifeHammers and they worked quite well cutting through the seatbealt and any of the windows EXCEPT the WINDSHIELD. Commit that to memory! In a emergency situation it will not easily crack or break the windshield, side and rear glass only. Mine is getting mounted in clear sight and access from the front seat, right in the middle of the rear seat benches so as to be easily grabbed by all! I have had experience with a stuck seat belt and they are a bitch to cut through with a semi-sharp pockt knife. This device attaches securely to the tow vehicle, but at a cost.They are cumbersome to attach and detach, with several moving parts and the potential to scratch the tow vehicle paint during either process if you don't have three hands available.To attain the secure vibration free fit, you must crank down on the ratcheted web strap hard enough to deform the door where it attaches to the window channel. It also deforms the rubber window seal.Foam pads protect the door somewhat where the bracket would otherwise rub on the body, but if the area isn't meticulously clean beforehand I can see where it would dull the paint over time.Because of the metal claw part that fits into the window channel, raising and lowering the window caused a screeching sound on my driver's side window.Finally, when they are detached from the door, they make for a very bulky awkward device that doesn't store conveniently or compactly in the vehicle.I'm sending them back. Very useful and precise. Even my mechanic asked me to order one for him. Beats opening the hood or even worse on my car, the battery is in the trunk under the floor. A pain to access if you have the optional rubber mat to protect the trunk floor. 
Very sturdy. Easy to drive up on when in the dirt, cement or gravel.  Slides backwards in the snow & we carry large nails to keep it in place in the snow.  They are quite large and barely fit into our storage compartment.  We had to cut off the handle in back to get it to fit. I use it place my EZ Pass in rental cars.  It fits and hasn't fallen off yet.  The transponder still works while in the device. This bug deflector sticks very good and fit great no need to poke holes in your jeep with the provided screws hold up even during some rough off road driving.  I would recommend this product 
Matched my car's color perfectly!  I  don't know what else to say but there is a word count requirement for the review... What can I say the title says it all, it works as described.  The construction is good, but nothing to write home about.  3.5 stars if I had to give it an overall rating.  In all honesty not quite a 4 stars on this one. Product is as described except under product features it says that alligator clips are included and it seems from other peoples comments that they aren't in any of the packages. Mine did not have them and I was counting on them being there since alot of comments say the ring terminals do not fit a battery ! 
Not much to say here, Dielectric grease. Works as advertised, large enough tube that should last quite a while. Thanks! Not much to say here except it is a plastic funnel about 5 inches in diameter with a long and flexible, see-through, plastic hose.  In my opinion this is a must have item for the vehicle trunk or truck tool box and this is one of acceptable quality and function. The handle could be a tad shorter, and the weight could have been reduced a little. It feels rather heavy and unwieldy to use, and it would have been better if the scraper were on the opposite side of the brush. The brush bristles are plentiful and stiff, making short work of most types of snow.Overall: 4/5 stars, decent price although could be less expensive and lighter in weight. The scraper is sturdy so far, and bristles work well in clearing snow. I wouldn't mind it if it were a few inches shorter. 
would recommend getting a  size  smaller than  what the  &#34;sizing chart&#34; recommends  as  I  measure aroun my leg  as  recommended  and  the chaps  were  one size too large.. otherwise they are  awesome  quality and build The meter has all the functions you could ask for a multimeter in a compact size.  The digits are large for the size of the meter, so it's easily readable by middle aged eyes. This is one-size-fits-most. It works on the filter for my 2002 Volkswagen Passat, but it's too large to grip the filter on my 1993 Chevrolet S10. 
This is the best stuff on earth when you need to do a repair and cannot do a proper weld. It will also stick to most anything including plastics. It is strong and can be sanded, drilled, tapped, and machined once it is set up. A must for any shop or do-it-yourselfer. This scratch remover seems to be more of a polish  and lube that will remove the surface scratches for the paint. It does not appear to have any &#34;grinding&#34; type ingredients in the paste.It will have little of no impact on deep scratches or deep nicks in the paint. It is easy to out on and remove and will a decent job for those light scratches. It did not remove any discoloring on my paint such as a stain left by a bird dropping. It ddi make the blemish lighter though. This treatment works well to &#34;kill&#34; rust and should be used along with a good rust primer and top coat paint to prevent future reoccurrence of corrosion returning. This product essentially treats the rust as the surface of the metal becomes pitted and sanding or grinding does not remove all of it before painting. Good product to use in any area you do not want to continually do over. This product is an absolute must to have on the shelf for any auto or product used in high salt states such as in the Northeast area of the country. Small price to pay for an added layer of security to your rust prevention project. 
I had some crap burned onto the bottom of my All Clad pans...I am a lousy cook.  It wasn't anything you could feel, just black marks from some meal gone horribly south.  Anyway, NOTHING I tried would get it off.  But then with Never Dull and a little elbow grease, they are like new.  So then I used it on the water-stained faucet that I thought was toasted...SHINY as new.  I am now LOOKING for things to polish because the results are so amazing.The wadding stuff has a strong smell, so use it in an open space...like gasoline or maybe paint remover type of smell.  Not a gross smell, but potentially unhealthy...like breathing fumes.LOVE LOVE LOVE. I remember seeing ads for this on TV since I was a kid.  I never believed them.  I've tried other products like Mother's Gold (which is great, but required a lot more work) and Turtle Wax spray on (which does not work as well).  So last weekend I had some free time and wanted to put a coat of wax on the car before winter came and did the usual damage.  Did one coat which took about 20-25 mins total to apply and buff off.  By the time I was done the sun was setting and it looked good.  The I woke up the next morning and wow.  I'm not going to say my car looked brand new but there was a definitive glossy shine on it that I had not seen in a long time.  Granted it is a bright yellow Mazda and it usually looks good, but after one coat there was a glossy clear coat finish look on it that was amazing.  I could see my reflection almost like looking into a mirror.  With something like Mother's Gold which costs a lot more and lord does it take a lot longer and a lot more elbow grease to use, you will get a similar result.  But with this, one coat, little over 20 mins and very easy on the elbow grease and I got the same result.  I'm going to throw everything else out as I will never use anything else.  Full disclosure I did also wash and compound the car first, but the Nu Finish really made the difference. The 3M Performance Finish wax is really something else. I absolutely love it. I've been using it for about a year or so now. It leaves a soft and smooth feeling on the paint and beads up like you wouldn't believe and also lasts quite a while. I just recently waxed a good portion of my car with Mother's Carnuaba Cleaner wax and it actually did not bead at all. With this kind of wax, allowing it to dry and haze is required for it to work properly. I did just that, but the next time I washed my car, the water came off so slowly and in "sheets" rather than beads. So then I used my 3M... exactly what I was expecting. And this stuff doesn't need to haze one bit. If you do let it haze, it actually leaves some streaks behind. Just work one small section at a time, applying the wax and then pretty much immediately wiping it back off. It's that simple. Also, clay bar your car and then follow that with the 3M... like butter. This stuff is worth every penny. I just waxed my whole car with it the other day and I'm going to do the same thing next time I wash it. It can't hurt to protect the paint. I'll be buying this stuff again and again and hopefully other 3M products. 
Tired of removing oil with gasoline I was convinced to try this. It works very well, smells nice, and has just enough abrasiveness to remove the grime whilst leaving your skin in tact! It breaks down the grease and oil without needing much scrubbing.I would buy again. I use the applicators for more then waxing cars. They are also good for staining wood. The fome applicators work ok, but don't lay wax evenly when waxing paint. I wet the applicator and ring out the extra water. Just making the applicator damp. Apply the wax to the applicator, fold the applicator in half so the wax spreds and apply to the paint. Same way as the movie.... wax on, wax off....lol I meant to take some pics of the built up chain oil and road debris before I performed the cleaning but I did not.  I have Yoshi R-22 chrome dual exhaust that was absolutely corroded.  This product not only took the burnt/caked/rust on stuff off, it also keeps it off.  I can now just rub my finger over the area and remove the crud.  With this oil cannot burn into the chrome.Buy it now. 
this is a great compliment to anawesome jack!  I highly recommend having this if you own the jack.  It can be of great use when using the jack is tough due to angles, etc. We purchased one and used this in our new trailer. It was easy to attach to the wall and looks great. Have used it for several applications besides my MAF, and will be using it on a regular basis as needed. 
In the past I've ruined leather because I was not aware that household cleaners or even other cleaners that are supposedly for leather do not have the proper pH to care for leather. They end up damaging the leather and/or soaking into the pores of the leather and clogging them, making the leather tacky and shortening the life of it.This is not the case with this Lexol cleaner. It is the correct pH so will not harm leather. Further, it seems to help feed and treat the leather as it gently cleans.I have noticed a difference! The leather seems healthier after using this product for sure. Unless I hear about something better in the future, I will swear by this stuff for all of my leather furniture and car upholstery.Note, on the bottle it states - "Not intended for stain removal." So, please don't expect this product to remove stains. It's more of a general routine leather cleaner. It does clean, because when using a white cloth, I notice some dirt on the cloth while using this.Also, a tip from a leather pro I know-wait 30 minutes after using this before applying a conditioner. This will allow the leather to fully dry. When researching what to do to make my car paint smooth as glass, I found this clay kit.  Works wonders, especially on weathered finishes.  Test your paint surface for roughness (everyone's has some) by putting your hand in a plastic baggie and wipe it over your car paint.  If it feels rough, which it should, then Meguiar's Clay Detailer is the cure!  Using the spray as a lubricant, the clay is rubbed along the paint surface removing bonded contaminants which cannot be removed by washing alone (tar, etc.).  I love it! The Lexol pH cleaner worked extremely well to clean automotive leather upholstery and surfaces. Just follow the instructions on the bottle and it does a fantastic job. Always use the pH cleaner before you apply the Lexol conditioner since you don't want to apply new oils over existing dirt. The pH cleaner comes out as a clear liquid that is more viscous than water. I recommend using a terry cloth sponge to create more lather than just using a cotton cloth or terry cloth. I have tried several over the counter leather cleaner/conditioners and Lexol beats them all.Pros: Cleans leather without drying it. Very easy to use.Cons: The product is a bit expensive and hard to find compared to the over-the-counter products, but it should be the only product to buy and Amazon carries it!Overall: If you own any leather accessories or cars with leather interiors, Lexol pH cleaner and Lexol conditioner should be on your list. 
I have always been a fan of permatex.  I would definently recommend these products to anyone.  I use a lot of their products I used this product to test the alternator on my car.  Worked great.  I am very happy with this product. I'm not a fan in adding anything to the fuel system.  But I put in some bad gas and my car developed a rough idle.  This cleaner helped.  I've tried other brands that didn't do anything, so in that respect this product works. 
Goes with mower yearly tuneup.The only problem I had was the bottle had a small hole in it. The box and other items I had ordered were soaked in oil. The bottle had leaked 2 oz. While the product applies to the purpose it serves, the packaging is very misleading. Don't judge it by the capacity of its bottle size because the content is only half the dimension of the bottle. It leaves the person scratching his/her head wondering if the volume within is half-empty or half-full. It goes by weight, but then why use such a large bottle (besides it is unsealed) giving the impression that you get a good deal based on the volume. I know the review should only be for the product, but the packaging Is very misleading. I love Royal Purple and have used it for 6 years now.  I fail to understand how packaging of 12 quarts of product offers a cheaper customer $/quart than a 5 gallon container. From someone who comes from a manufacturing of consumer goods job this pricing structure is bogus.  Had the pricing been better for the 5 gallon on a per quart basis I would have rated my purchase of the 5 gallon a 5 star. 
After reading reviews and opinions on other waxes, I just stuck with what I`ve used before and I`m not disappointed at all. I did however apply this wax with a buffer. After cutting the hull with Flitz, I followed through with Flagship premium wax and this 15 year hull looks incredible! I've done 3 oil changes on my BMW 330xi with this vacuum, and its still going strong. It removes oil quickly and without mess.I've been cleaning mine out with gasoline after i use it. Im not sure if this will make the vac last longer, but im hoping so. Definitely worth $80. I love this degreaser,  I use it for pretty much everything that is oily or greasy and dilute it according to my needs.  The strongest I use is 1 to 1 and that is for cleaning really greasy bike parts or for cleanup after an oil change. I use yto get it at Costco years ago, but they stopped carrying it.  I am glad amazon has it. 
Figuring the kitchen needs to be most level, we placed it on the kitchen counter. Works well. Handy size for use and storage in a drawer.  ~Pegleg~ It was too big to fit within any of our cabinet doors and wife wouldn't let me mount it where it could be seen !Anyone for fish cleaning knives in the storage area ? I use this in our travel trailer. It's a good fit on the counter, but the stand needs to be a bit taller to be able to slope the water toward the sink, so I end up propping the end up a bit. I don't use it for storing since it's an open grate on the bottom and don't want to chance spilling any detergent or soap during transit.

These things are rated 8,000lbs but that's for ( GVW ) so while it's correct technically in reality each item is rated by the label at 2,000lbs per each item and if you had 4 (they sell them in pairs), if you had 4 of them you could put 8,000lbs on them, technically and according to them.****I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO RELY ON USER REVIEWS TO GET THE INDIVIDUAL WEIGHT RATING!!!!***GVW is a very deceptive and dangerous way to market and label these products.  Consider this, on a truck, the majority of the weight is on the front two wheels while the rear wheels don't have as much weight - same is true on a front wheel vehicle.  This leads to situations where you could overextend the capacity of these products.I'd like a very clear rating: 2,000lbs, 4,000lbs, 6,000lbs for each stand or ramp on Amazon so that I know how much weight I can safely put on it similar to what is found on jacks....a jack is not labeled as 6,000lbs if it can lift a 6,000GVW vehicle, 6,000lbs means that the jack can lift 6,000lbs!After all, I'm planning to get under these things!!!!On items like this where someone's life very literally depends on the labeling ---  it would be really really really nice (and a legal requirement) that the specifications on Amazon very clearly stated both the operating weight, maximium weight, and crush (failure) weight per each ramp/stand versus this GVW rating which is deceptive and just plain dangerous.I have very literally found people working underneath 8,000lbs trucks without the wheels using jack stands sold as "2ton" when in reality each jack stand was only rated at 1ton or 2,000lbs.....their comment back, "this is a 2 ton stand and 8,000lbs GVW divided by 4 is 2,000lbs or 1ton, plenty of margin."  When in reality 6,000lbs are up front....3,000lb for each wheel  and each stand rated at only 2,000lbs....making their jack stand 150% overloaded! --- horrendously scary (all because marketing is so bad in this area).  Yes people should exercise care in using double protection and users should Always read their instructions and warning before putting their life on the line -- but for the love of God, there is a responsibility on the makers and marketers of these products to label them very clearly and in bold with the weight that EACH can hold and Amazon should post that weight for each item in BOLD Yellow or Orange wording with very clear warnings.Amazon and automotive sellers on Amazon need to get on the ball regarding the needs of auto ethusiasts and for the safety of the weekend mechanic who should not have to do complex math to figure out how much weight each item can hold!We REALLY need to get away from GVW, it's deceptive and dangerous!****I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO RELY ON USER REVIEWS TO GET THE INDIVIDUAL WEIGHT RATING!!!!*** No more using the penny or quarter to measure the tire tread. No more second guessing. With this gauge, you can see the actual measurement at an affordable cost. The only drawback I noticed,like some reviewers say, is it leaks oil. 
i use these for aftermarket batteries for 12v power wheels. can charge with a battery tender and fit together nicely I originally purchased the Deltran Battery Tender Jr. (021-0123) to keep the battery on my vehicle charged as it&#8217;s advertised of being capable of doing so on the packaging. This battery tender did not charge the battery on my car within the 72 hour window and turned off (Has a built-in timer). I called Deltran (877-456-7901) and was told by customer service that the Deltran Battery Tender Jr. was too small to use on a car/truck battery and that I should have purchased the Deltran Battery Tender Plus. I eventually purchased the Deltran Battery Tender Plus (021-0128) and the Deltran 12.5 ft. extension lead (DBT081-0148-12). The Deltran Battery Tender Jr. works fine on my walk behind lawn mower with electric start and should be fine for anything with a small battery. I would suggest that you purchase the Deltran Battery Tender Plus so you can have the option of using it on more equipment. Deltran should change the label on the Deltran Battery Tender Jr. if it&#8217;s not really intended for car/truck batteries. Check out batterytender.com for Deltrans&#8217; complete line. The Battery Tender Junior 12V Charger comes complete with everything needed to charge your 12V battery.  I purchased this model to specifically charge my motorcycle battery and I am pleased to say that the unit works great.  It is a very compact charger and is supplied with several attachments to ensure that your battery is kept in an optimum condition.I made the permanent hard wire attachment to my battery using the color coded leads connected directly to the appropriate positive & negative terminals on the battery. The opposite female end has an end cap which can cover the inlet when not in use. When I know that I will not be hitting the road for an extended period of time, I simply plug the unit in to maintain my existing battery's power supply.Battery Tender makes larger charging units, but this battery charger is great for charging everything from batteries for ATV's and motorcycles to scooters and lawn mowers. Because of it's very discreet size it does not take up any needed space. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to protect their battery investment and do not want to compromise space and versatility. 
Nice high amp (current) rating on this. I epoxy it to a 12ah  12 volt gel battery and I can use it as a jumpstarter oremergency power supply for camping or power outages. After a power outage, I connected my refrigerator to this power supply. Sadly, its inverter was unable to support my refrigerator. The Duracell DPP-600HD doesn't have enough momentary  output to handle the initial start-up current spike of a refrigerator's compressor motor. The specifications say it can momentarily provide up to 960 watts. This equates to 8 amps at 120v.  Yet, public benchmark figures for a home refrigerator's start-up current indicate 13 amps for up to 1/2 second. Other appliances that use electric motors such as sump pumps are likely to exhibit the same characteristics. My suggestion is that customers immediately test this product with any device they intend to power during an outage.Some important specifications are missing in the Amazon listing.  One of the key statics is the capacity of the internal battery, which is 28 amp-hours at 12 v.  This equates to 336 watt hours.  Yet, AC output is much lower than this presumably due to inverter losses.  These losses increase with power output.  The following table illustrates this.  The last column is my calculation.load.................watts....hours....watt-hoursCordless telephone.....5........35.0 ...175Portable stereo.........10........22.0 ...220Laptop computer.......20........7.0 ....140Fan.......................100.........1.7....17036" TV...................133........1.2 ....1603/8 drill.................300........0.4 ....115Warm-air fan heater.312........0.4 ....109Blender..................385........0.3 ....109HID Floodlights.......400........0.3.....107Observe that the total energy delivered (watt-hour) drops with power consumption.  Ultimately, the usable energy is significantly less than what is contained within the lead acid battery.For reference, a refrigerator will use about 200 watts of electricity when the compressor is running. Typical consumers will have their refrigerator running about 50% to 60% of the time, which equates to an average of 100-120 watts being consumed continuously.ConsDoesn't handle current spikes associated with certain electric motorsProsBoth AC and DC outputPortableSimple operation I was using this to power my Viair 00073 70P Heavy Duty Portable Compressor but with 6amp it doenst do the Job, returned it and went with Schumacher 1216 12V 15 Amp Power Converter, good to go! 
I have aWagan Power Dome EX 400-Watt Jump Starter with Built-In Air Compressorthat is a permanent tool in one of our family car. That unit's quality was highly questionable. Finally on the third replacement I had a good one. It had the features I wanted: compressor (for kids bikes, balls), inverter, USB power, and jumper. It was a worthy compromise of battery power and features.But I want a second unit, with focus on a battery that can power my electronics longer and jump a car. This model seems to allow longest running of electronics out of all battery-based units with inverter/jumper.When this unit arrive, I expected to charge for 48 hours per instruction. But seems like the unit was already fully charged before shipping out. Within minutes, the charging status showed solid green and battery status reported 100%. That's nice when they can charge it (Amazon warehouse?) before shipping it out.First test powering my more power-hungry laptops (80 watts), LCD monitors, portable fans, etc. I'm happy to report the expected duration is quite accurate. For example, one of my appliance that averages 75 watt runs for about 2 hours and 20 minutes. 100 watt electronics ran for 2 hours.*SIDE NOTE* One of my favorite thing is to power my PS3 console in this marvelous gaming case:GAEMS Halo UNSC Vanguard Personal Gaming Environment (Xbox NOT Included)As for starting a car with dead battery, I had the opportunity to tested just 2 days after receiving it. I had left my car's lights on in the morning, and by start of evening the battery was not strong enough to start the car. After connecting the jumpers, the first two cranks resulted in no go. After waited for 5 minutes, I started the car again and the car started without any hesitation.What this means to me that the rated crank amp of 350CA is not strong enough to jump start most cars with a "dead" battery. (I think AAA guy once told me average cars need 600 - 700 crank amps).  Even my Wagan 400 watt inverter (with 600 crank amps) couldn't get car started on first try many times.  If it cannot start immediately, don't panic! Wait a few minutes!  A car battery is technically dead at 12V, and fully charged at 12.6 - 12.8V. So by letting the powerpack to charge the car battery for 5 - minutes, it frequently is enough to raise the voltage close to 12.6 to start the car.Anyway, it's a good start for me on this battery. But time will tell if the battery can retain charge to be useful for at least two years. Will update here in a few months. Came with separate acid.  Was easy to fill with no mess, although it takes several minutes.  Wait 30 min after, then charge it for a few hours, then let sit for a few hours and test voltage... if correct, install in the bike.  Not much else to say, it works. I see a lot of negative reviews for this charger that I think are partially due to Amazon's incorrect description and the fact that most people don't know what size or type of charger they need. (including myself)I am a practicing Electronic engineer with more than 20yrs experience. I did not know much about battery chargers until recently researching what a good battery charger should do.1) this charger only delivers a max of 1.5A. This means if you try to charge a discharged auto battery (48AH) it will take a long long time. This charger does work great for topping off a car battery at 70% (12.4V).2) The instructions included clearly state the charger will automatically shut-off after 12 hours of charging. The charger will restart and continue charging if you unplug and then plug the charger in again. Best to get a higher capacity charger.3) This charger does have a float mode sort of. Actually it shuts off the charging current and monitors battery voltage. When the battery voltage drops low enough the charger cycles on to top it off and then shuts off again.MY SUMMARY 1st:I like this charger and think it does a good job for the PRICE. Gold box special was $15.20 + tax. (I would definitely buy it at the regular price for $3$)It's basically automatic. Don't have to set the voltage and it won't damage anything if you reverse the clips accidently. Compact size and reasonable quality clamps.This charger does what it is designed for. That is charge small batteries and top off larger automotive batteries. This is an excellent maintenance charger for all batteries to keep them fully charged when not in use. (My opinion)Personally I would not leave any charger connected to my battery for more than 24 hours. Now I use a cheap mechanical timer that is set to turn on for 1 hour every 24 hours. I would prefer a timer that I can set to turn on twice a week for a few hours.The charger is small feels solidly built with heavy plastic. It gets very warm aftercharging at 1.5A but not warm enough to be concerned. (no cooling fan)I gave this charger 5 stars because PRICE and performance is very good. Build quality is good as well.AMAZON DESCRIPTION (Poor): is incorrect in that this charger is not intended to be used to charge a LOW (discharged) car battery. The chart in the DESCRIPTION that shows the charging times is different than the manual.. The included MANUAL has a chart that states this charger should only be used as a "top off" or maintenance charger for auto batteries. In addition the charger in charging mode automatically shuts off after 12 hours of charging. (A good safety feature in my opinion.)Charging details:I discharged a car/truck jump start battery pack to 12.45V or approx 75% charge.(Typical full charge is 12.65V to 12.7V. To discharge the battery I used a battery/alternator tester. I have a voltmeter attached to charger and a current meter in series with battery and battery charger negative terminal.1) At the start of the charge, the charge current was 0.78A and then jumped to 1.52A in a few minutes.2) After 1 hour the charge current is 1.47A. Charge voltage is 13.0V.3) After 2 hours the charge current is 1.48A. Charge voltage is 13.25V.4) After 3 hours the charge current is 1.43A. Charge voltage is 13.46V.5) After 4 hours the charge current is 1.40A. Charge voltage is 13.82V.Note: that the charge current is decreasing as the battery is approaching full charge. This design feature will prevent overheating and extend the life of your battery.6) After 5 hours the charge current is 0.68A. Charge voltage is 14.71V.7) After 5.5 hours the charge current is 0.35A. Charge voltage is 14.67V.8) After 6 hours the charge current is 0.29A. Charge voltage is 14.73V.9) After 6.5 hours the charge current is 0.24A. Charge voltage is 14.72V.10) After 8.5 hours the charge current is 0.20A. Charge voltage is 14.73V.11) After 10.5 hours the charge current is 0.15A. Charge voltage is 14.71V.12) After 11.5 hours the charge is COMPLETE and the charge current has dropped to 0.0A. BATTERY voltage is 13.55V and declining. Charger is in the monitor mode. In monitor mode the charger AC power is 3W measured with a Belkin Watt meter.Almost 12 hours seems like a long time to charge a battery and this isn't even a full capacity car battery. But, it did a good job of gently charging the battery especially when it was near full charge. The important thing to me is the charging current declined as the battery neared full charge. This prevents overcharging and truly tops off the battery to maximum capacity.I tested the battery the next day with a battery tester and it passed well within the "good battery" full charge limits. The results were much better than the charger that came with the battery pack where it tested NEAR "weak".Very happy with the purchase. I would buy this exact model again. Should there be any problem(s) in the future I will update this review.Ships from and sold by Amazon. 
I should have gotten the Honda cap.  This fits OK, but the screws are not "captured" in the cap.  With the original cap,the screws cannot fall out.  Considering the position of the screws when mounting this, captured screws are an advantage. There are two horns, not one. One is 400Hz and the other one is 500Hz.PIAA | Automotive Sports Horn (400/500Hz) #85110The are exact fits on the mounts as the OEM horns and use the same bolts. A 1/4 inch drive ratchet and a 12mm socket is needed to remove and install the bolt. They came with grounding leads with ring spade lugs that mounted readily under the existing M6 bolts on the radiator supports. All you need is a 10mm socket.The two wiring harness leads are too short to connect the horns. Two wire tie mounts hold the harness to the aluminum bumper reinforcement. You can cut off the ties and use the OEM harness to connect the horns, but I chose not to.  I prefer NOT to cut off the OEM connector blocks.I made two pigtail extensions out of 18 gauge black primary wire, 5 inches long. One end needs a 1/4 inch wide exposed male quick disconnect. The other end needs an insulated female 1/4 inch quick disconnect terminal. Since I used 18 gauge wire, I used the red coded ones.The exposed male connector slides into the OEM horn connector perfectly. The female one clips easily onto the positive terminal of each horn.The horns how have a weather shield on the apertures.Best thing to my surprise is that they appear to be very high quality and Made in Japan.Also nice is that they need no modification to the horn relay or circuit. The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around! 
I use this with my Viair compressor and it makes things much easier. Also great for bypassing the cigarette lighter to charge the battery for many trickle chargers.Only thing I wish was that the clamps opened a little more to fit easier on the terminals/connectors. Its hard to say anything bad about these batteries.Much smaller than the other battery and it wont rot out the battery tray. I like this battery tester a lot so far.  I am not inclined to understand complex displays, I want something to tell me if my car battery is good, bad or so-so.  I connected the clamps to the battery terminals as directed in the instructions and 12.55 lit up on the LED screen and a green light came on saying my battery was good.  I don't really know what "type" of battery I have in my car.  I looked at it as best I could but I guess it didn't matter since the tester told me immediately the voltage it contained.  I was curious about it's voltage because I think my battery is around 3 years old and I wondered if it was still holding a full charge or not.This tester is very easy to operate, is extremely light weight, small and could easily fit into a car's glove compartment.  My car battery is the only battery I've tested so far.  I will take it over to my mom's house this weekend and test her car battery and any other batteries that fall within it's testing parameters. And it's great that this tester doesn't need any batteries of it's own to work.  It uses the charge off the battery it's testing to power itself.  Pretty cool! 
I bought this as an extension cord from my pop up camper battery to the inside of my camper. I hooked up a 200watt inverter on the other side. Good, low guage wire. I have some fog lights that I use on the back of my truck to light up the sides of my 5th wheel when I am pulling in to a camping spot at night. I got these so I can easly connect and disconnect these lights. They make it very easy to connect/disconnect anything you have that just needs power and ground. I have been an RVer for several years and have been wanting to get either a backup camera system or backup alarm. Choice the alarm. It was so easy to hook up. I tested it and heard it from the cabin of the RV. Pretty amazing to me. I mounted it just above the rear license plate so it was accessible to the tail light assembly. I like the total weather proofing of the device. I just coated the terminals with liquid tape to keep water from rusting the terminals. 
I've an Optima in my old Corvette that has now failed.  I've have read thru their warranty information.  It states that the battery must be returned to the selling dealer for warranty service.  It cannot be returned to Amazon for any reason.  Therefore my question is this:If the battery purchased thru amazon should require warranty service, how is this done and by whom? INNOVA 3030 Diagnostic Code Reader for OBDII Vehiclesi purchased this product last month and i don't know why. it reads your on-board computer alright. but if you want a detail report of a problem you might be having with your check engine light on, they charge you a fee for a complete detail report.AUTOZONE,ADVANCEAUTO AND CARQUEST will test your vehicle free of charge and will provide you with a detail report for free.the fleecing of america continues by online companies.AMAZON, SHAME OF YOU !!!!!!!! I ordered one of these for my 2008 Saturn Vue. Package marked for 2008 Vue but item did not work. Contacted storefront who fullfilled order for Amazon and was referred to Curt mfg. to obtain return number. Then had to contact seller again. Got a refund but I purchased a replacement from a local dealer. Seller later reported a wrong item number was somehow in the package. 
A necessary for today's vehicles.My Camry had two outlets  in the front but the demand was very high as my GPS,my phone,my daughters's Laptop and her phone,heated and massaging car seat etc. were all looking for their turn to connect. Hence I ordered this along with an inline fuse and got it installed by a professional by bypassing the ignition switch.Now my GPS and phone charger a  re connected to these outlets and now my GPS (which is my mp 3 music player also) and phone batteries remain charged . and the two factory installed outlets are available for any other requirement. It works and the support staff at Linear Logic are helpful if you have any issues.  My local shop suspected that I have a bad O2 sensor that wasn't being flagged by the on-board computer.  With the ScanGauge, I programmed in codes for fuel trim, O2 sensors, and air/fuel ratio and can see that it all looks ok.  Saved $100+ in diagnosis charges and I can monitor the readings as I drive. No issues, just as described.  Used to connect my motorcycle to Battery Tender charger.  Also connect to adapter to charge my cell phone. 
You can tell from the details it is a quality product. Comes in charged but don't rely on that, charge it of at least 8 hours and press the red button to check the charge. You can attach to an extension cord to charge or you can also charge by plugging into the cigarette lighter while you drive. Keep upright and charged in your car or at the house. Very useful in emergencies. Make sure Red and Black leads don't get &#34;together&#34; (Keep them isolated.One deficiency I noticed: It could have done with a compressor and a light to help in darkness. PROS:Indicator light while charging. Shows when charging is complete.AC power cable.Easy to get inexpensive terminal adapters so you can leave them on your vehicle and trickle charge as necessary. Very easy to use, extra long cord. Nice price and the unit functions just as stated. It does a very good job of charging and letting you know at what status of charge the battery is at. 
Bought this to install with an aftermarket Kenwood Navigation 7120 on my 08 Toyota Tacoma.  It took several hours to install, but it works great with the wheel controls in my Toyota. Simple install, 2-wire hookup. Works as advertised. It can be installed at 2 different angles, gives an option for mounting. Installed on a 2006 Acura MDX and it was painless... worst part of the install was getting out the interior panel holders as I did not have the proper tool. 
Just like fire needs oxygen, heat, and fuel, cars become roadblocks withoug gas, battery, and air.  You can carry more gas, and a second battery / electrical system, but air is hard to find, and with "service" stations removing it from their offerings of yesteryear, you need to have your own air system.What impressed me most about this compressor was the attachment point to the valvestem.  It is threaded and screws on, forming a seal during refil.  This seal is exceptional - good enough that the guage mounted on the compressor itself is accurate to set your tire pressure at the other end of the hose.  If you are filling a big tire, it will take some time, so this lets you sit back and relax while the motor works.  My tire chucks for shop air all require constant finger pressure to ensure a seal - not having to get tire chuck thumb was a nice side benefit!As for portable inflation systems, I've grown tired of anything with a cigarette lighter plug as the power source.  It's limited to 10 AMPs which gives you roughly 130-140 watts of power.  740 would be a full horsepower.  This compressor under load can draw 30 amps at 13V, for 390 watts - more than a half horsepower.  To do that they use clipon cable back to the battery.  Because I carry a second battery I clip on to it for the juice to run this.  It will also work with your main starting battery if you don't have a backup elecrical source.In the box you will find a carrying bag as well as an octogonal shaped piece of plastic - thats the air input filter - you need to screw it onto the air inlet to protect the compressor.  Its a quality unit so it needs protection.When all is said and done you have a 1/2 hp 12VDC compressor that gives you the freedom to set your tire pressure when and where you want to.  With the fast fill rate it takes very little time to top off your tires, if you want to drop your pressure for sand offroad and then refill it later when you hit asphalt this is a small but valuable tool to have in your emergency kit.The unit has a well balanced carrying handle to take it between tires and is light weight enough to take with you everywhere.  While you can use your car's starting battery, a second battery will prevent you from draining your starting battery.  When done, start up and drive away.If you seriously go offroad consider a highjack lift to get you out of a bind, or else a hydraulic system with a portable cylinder fed from your engine's hydraulic pump (if yours is equipped with one) or a secondary hydraulic system powered by your secondary electrical system - with all this you will not be stuck for long!Finally maintaining your tire pressure at proper levels for your load optimizes your fuel efficiency - at $3+ / gallon for fuel these days your efforts will pay for themselves shortly.While I have a 240VAC compressor in my shop, this is the first honest 12VDC compressor that does not take forever to fill a tire.  With a half horsepower air cooled motor it does the job quite well.  It's worth the money to keep onboard. I was in need of an Air Compressor but I did not want to get one that was huge.  This little guy is pretty small and does the job!  You set your PSI, plug it in and hook up to whatever needs air.  The Air Compressor will stop automatically once it reaches the preset PSI.  It is awesom if it ever breaks down I will be picking up another! This little compressor has far exceeded my expectations. I have had two plumbed to an air tank that ran air tools on my rig. They run forever and have never gave me a problem. The only thing I would suggest is to switch out the male hose adaptor. This will allow you to run a regular sized higher quality hose that can attach to regular air tools/hoses in a pinch. The one that comes with it is an odd ball size. Don't get me wrong...you can't run air tools directly from this compressor. But using two into a tank makes it possible. I would buy another one in a heart beat. A little noisy but what compressor isn't?! It pushed a decent amount of air for the money. You need one for your vehicle so just buy it. 
This thing is Awsome.  It has all a camper or over the road traveler needs for emergency power and presurized air.  Comes with Battery Cables, Air Pressure Hose and Coinnections, Instruction Booklet (a must read), and several types of power outlets.  You will need an electrical extension cord, which is not included, to charge it up via AC Outlet, or you can charge it up via the 12Volt Auto Lighter Adapter Cord, which is included, but which I would not recomend unless you have no other source of power, because this thing looks like it packs a punch.  I like it and think it's worth the money.  I just started using it so Icannot speak to its durability, bt otherwise it is Awsome.  Recomend. I got a power plug to power plug style &#34;jumper&#34; device for my daughter, in case the 12V battery on her Prius dies.  Since the Prius doesn't use the 12V battery to start the motor, she doesn't need real jumper cables.  However, it's a keyless ignition, so she will not be able to jump power plug to power plug.  The battery on the Prius is has small terminals, so these are a nice size and should do the job of getting power from someone else's light to her battery. Mine arrived perfect, simple to open packaging, and works as expected. Easy to use and comes with clamps and permanently installed wires if desired. This does not delufate, nor start a car, and at low amps would take weeks to recharge a drained battery, deep-cycle AGM or Gel type, as this is a very low amp trickler/float charger. Most AGM's require a special 3-4 staged 10-30 amp charger. Once the battery is charged this will do its job of tending/maintaining a full charge on any 12 volt DC lead-acid battery. I also have two Battery MINDers for our RV and towed that are garaged over the winter and a Tender plus for a truck. You need close access to an outlet or a properly sized extension cord and you can leave the battery attached, in the vehicle. I recommend this, would buy again, and hope this helps someone. 
Users might have trouble understanding exactly how to use the gauge without the instructions in hand because the design isn't intuitive.  But I do 'really like' this item.Simply taking a pressure reading is easy enough: Power on, hold it in your hand with your thumb on the raised bumps on that little slope above the big round button and press it against the valve until it beeps a couple of seconds later.  The reading is very accurate and the display easy to read in any weather condition.  And once you set your target pressures in the unit you can see how well your reading matches your preferred pressure.  On these points alone, I give it four stars, but not five for the following reasons.- The gauge powers off only a moment after you take a reading, so you have to start it again and select front or rear for each tire.  There should be a way to set how many seconds before it shuts off.- I don't even remember what the biggest button on the gauge does, but both its placement and the way it's marked causes you to naturally think it's the power and reset button.  It's not.  If I have to guess, it's probably "Enter" for when you're setting it up with your target tire pressures--I don't remember.- Bottom button, don't remember.  The bottom line on design here is, too many buttons which aren't intuitive or logically placed. Consider this...  The combine cost of your tow vehicle and trailer...  The combine weight of your tow vehicle and trailer...  The fact that your trailer may well weigh more than your tow vehicle...  And that moron that just jumped in your lane then slammed on his brakes...  This is NOT the time to think to yourself, "maybe I should've gotten a better brake controller."  Seriously, when the difference in cost is under $100, is it really not worth buying the best?I've used the Tekonsha P3 for two and half years now and I have nothing but praises to sing!  Features, user friendliness, and results!  This unit has it all.  First lets talk about the mechanism.  It uses a digital G-Sensor as apposed to a physical pendulem.  Why is this a benifit?  Because there are no downhill issues that you see with the physical and analog type sensors.  Prior to digial sensors, the downhill slope would throw off the pendulem and the brake controller either would send a weaker current to the brakes or none at all.  Some people have questioned the reliablity of digital sensors.  But with more than 10 years of full production digital units, complaints are actaully less than the older analog units.  Consider this as well, the sensor is not only quicker but more accurate as well, hard to soft braking is much safer now.  How does it work?  Just like any other accelerometor...it senses the volume deceleration and then computes an appropriate voltage and current to send to the trailer brakes based on a percentage of the user's max output setting.Let's talk interface.  A four button face with a roughly 1.5" LCD display plus a belly mounted manual switch.  With no brakes connected, this unit will dispay the default "Tekonsha Screen".  Once brakes are connected via the trailer plug, the unit will display the "Tow Screen".  It has a large two/three read out that displays 0.0 as a default.  While sitting still and once brake pressure is applied it will jump to approximately 10% of the max set output, after 3 seconds of being stationary it will move up to 25% power.  This is designed to "hold" the trailer if stopped on an incline or decline.  Setting the max brake power is a snap with the two "Up" and "Down" buttons on the left side of the face.  The value moves up and down by 0.1 increments and quite quickly if you hold the button down.  The last two buttons are "boost" and "page" which I will discuss when I talk features.  The last button is the manual brake override.  This bottom mounted spring loaded slider switch will manually add braking power to the trailer brakes (up to the user set max) even without depressing the vehicles brake peddle.  This is a standard feature on all brake contorllers, but I wanted anyone looking for their first brake controller to understand what this was.  Lastly, is the warning screen.  It's a deep red screen with a trailer and a "no" sign.  This indicates that the controller which had previously sensed brakes connected no longer can sense them.  Generally an indication of a poor trailer connection at the wiring harness or a problem with the brakes themsleves.Let's talk features.  I've mentioned the "Boost" button, but what is it?  There are 4 levels of boost for trailer brakes.  Off, LV. 1, LV. 2, & LV. 3.  Boost adds a brief (fraction of a second) burst to the trailer brakes which slows the trailer slightly more than the normal pressure would and keeps it from bumping or pushing the tow vehicle when brake pressure is initailly applied.  Very important if as many are these days, your trailer weighs more than your tow vehicle.  After the burst it returns the voltage and current to the G-sensors reccomended output.  There isn't a real scientific method for figuring what you need to use.  The picture on the home screen shows LV1 as small trailer, 2 as a med tailer, and 3 as a large trailer.  My trailer is a 6K lb. TT and I just leave it on the default LV. 1 boost.  Everytime the units is powered it returned to the default LV. 1.  The unit will power down after 15 mins with no trailer connected AND no input from the brake signal wire.  The "Page" button will take you to a second screen that you navigate with the "up", "down", and "Boost" (now "enter") buttons.  This sceen has some cool features as some useful features.  "Backlight" allows you to brighten or dim the brightness of the display.  "Color" lets you set the color of the display.  (Yeah I know, unessesary, but cool)  The default color is "White" which is more of a light blue.  There's also Magenta, Orange, Dk Blue, Violet, Lt. Green, and Dk. Green.  Red is not availible as it's reserved as a warning color for the "no trailer connection" warning screen.  Back to the page screen.  There's also a VERY USEFUL troubleshooting screen.  It lets you view diagnostics on the fly and over the road that can give you four digit readouts of battery voltage, stoplight (brake input signal) voltage, brake voltage, and brake current.  This screen alone is worth the cost of this brake controller!  When you first connect your tailer do some tests and record the max input you set, the output under normal braking conditions, as well as the brake voltage and amperage.  If down the line you get the feeling the brakes aren't working properly, you can re-run this test and see if it's an electrical problem or not.  Finally when your done, pressing the page button will return you to the "tow screen."Installation.  A snap for anyone that has a factory tow package.  Tekonsha offers plug and play wiring harnesses that plug into most make and model years of trucks.  If you have to have it installed or choose to install it yourself as I did, it can be challenging.  But it's a simple four wire hookup.  A 12V input from the battery (running thru a 30A auto reset breaker NOT a fuse), an output to the brake pin of your 6 or 7-way trailer connector, a stoplight input running to your vehicle's stoplight switch behind the brake peddle, and lastly a frame ground.  The mount can be a little challenging to install because of the akward access to the screws, but it can be mounted at nearly any angle other than strait up or down and provided the face is facing a close to directly rearward as possible.All in all, this is probably the most important review I've ever done.  This controller will save you grief and keep you and your vehicle safe.  Make sure for your safety, your families safety, and the safety of all those on the road you buy the brake controller that does it's job the best.  Buy the Tekonsha P3. Works as advertised, be patient and follow directions, it WILL program!  Make sure you turn the ignition key fast, listen for the doors to lock, and you are good to go..... 
THIS IS THE PERFECT TIRE PRESSURE GAUGE FOR CHECKING TIRE PRESSURE ACCURATELY, QUICKLY AND EASILY.  SIMPLY PUT THE END OVER THE VALVE STEM, HOLD IT FIRMLY FOR A SECOND OR TWO AND READ THE PRESSURE.  THE GAUGE ON THE NEW TIRE PUMP IS NOT CORRECT AND NEITHER IS THE PRESSURE GAUGE ON THE ELECTRIC TIRE PUMP THAT ATTACHES TO THE CIGARETTE LIGHTER. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE ACCUTIRE MS DIGITAL TIRE PRESSURE GAUGE. The gauge is very, very accurate (to a half pound).  It does however need to be released VERY QUICKLY from the stem or the air escaping will re-set the gauge to zero. You may have a tire pressure gauge, but this tool allows you to measure accurately when your tires need replacing.  It is durable and precise in its ability to measure the depth of your tire treads. 
I used this charger once only on an Optima battery (AGM) and it performed flawlessly. I set it on 10amp it charged it fully saying it was on 10amp but it had swiched to 2amp for final charge which is how a fully automatic charger is supposed to work. When the charged light came on my Kline multimeter says the Optima is fully charged. If it didn't I would send it back to Amazon, which is how you are instructed to handle an issue like that, and they will deal with Optima. I also love the size of this charger. It is very small, and light, and easy to use. Another good experience from Amazon. I purchased this to charge and Maintain batteries but the unit I got does not maintain at all and the cooling fan never operates no matter what amp charge setting. Connected to a car battery I start charging and it shows battery is at 70% which is nice and after full charge at 100% the charger goes into Charge/Maintain mode but that's where it stops working like others have reported...came back to the battery after two days and the battery isn't charged and so I unplug the charger and plug it back in and it shows battery at 52%. The battery is connected to 4 10 watt LED lights that come on after dark for 6 hours so I expected this charger to start charging when the battery is down but that is not the case like how my last battery charger/maintainer worked. It only seems to charge and not maintain so It's being returned to Amazon.Don't trust it to keep a battery maintain.Update. Amazon replace charger and was quick about it...but the new charger arrived DOA and now on the way back to Amazon for refund. Done with this brand. I originally purchased the Deltran Battery Tender Jr. (021-0123) to keep the battery on my vehicle charged as it&#8217;s advertised of being capable of doing so on the packaging. This battery tender did not charge the battery on my car within the 72 hour window and turned off (Has a built-in timer). I called Deltran (877-456-7901) and was told by customer service that the Deltran Battery Tender Jr. was too small to use on a car/truck battery and that I should have purchased the Deltran Battery Tender Plus. I eventually purchased the Deltran Battery Tender Plus (021-0128) and the Deltran 12.5 ft. extension lead (DBT081-0148-12). The Deltran Battery Tender Jr. works fine on my walk behind lawn mower with electric start and should be fine for anything with a small battery. I would suggest that you purchase the Deltran Battery Tender Plus so you can have the option of using it on more equipment. Deltran should change the label on the Deltran Battery Tender Jr. if it&#8217;s not really intended for car/truck batteries. Check out batterytender.com for Deltrans&#8217; complete line. 
Good quality R.V. water heater drain valve. Brass construction with a steel finger tip handle built in. A vital component when winterizing or just performing general maintenance. Teflon tape will seal threads upon install. Great replacement for older leaking or rusty valves. It is a shutoff, does what it is supposed to. Camco 40003 RV Water Tank Filler with Shutoff Valve.  would buy again Used this to diagnose my EVAP system in my 03 grand cherokee.  Had a few cracked hoses and a faulty leak detection pump.  This allowed me to rule out the duty cycle purge valve (~$100), the vent valve (~$15), the vapor canister (~$100), and also helped me diagnose the leak detection pump failing.  It has already paid for itself. 
When you use this fogging oil first spray into directly into intake (take off filter if necessary)with the engine running, this help keeps the intake and carburetor clean. then after 10 seconds shutdown engine then take spark plugs out then use attachment and spray (for 3 seconds) into each cylinder via sparkplug hole. you can then optionally pull the cord slowly or run the engine with disconnected spark plugs if you have electric start, this allows the engine to cycle the fogging oil on the piston and cyclinder. You can even run the engine briefly like for 2 seconds and the engine will throw out thick plumes of white smoke if you are looking to see the fog.using the fogging oil through the intake is not enough to PROPERLY fog your engine. A must for your RV water heater that requires and Anode Rod.  You should remove it at least once a year to be sure there is enough surface on the Anode Rod.  Will save replacing the the whole water heater if you fail to do this. A little difficult to remove and reinstall, but again worth the time and effort. There is an acceptable itsy bitsy leak left. You can watch &#34;Fixing Oil Seal Leaks Fast&#34; video on YouTube by scottykilmer. You need 8 ounces for car engine or transmission usage, and 3 ounces for power steering. I am going to order more for power steering and transmission usage. 
I have one of these on each of my motorcycles so that I can keep them on Battery Tender battery chargers when parked. This is also a handy power lead for a 12v air pump.The fuse that comes stock in this harness is a bit weak for running an air pump. I've had to put in slightly higher amperage fuses, but I haven't encountered any problems with the higher amp fuses. I bought this to work with the Master Flow 1040 air pump. I have one and it never blew my fuse. I have been reading that some vehicles may have lower rated fuses in the Accessory circuit. I tested this by connecting it to the battery and the pump ran just fine. I have a Power Bright PW1100-12 which works well and the Power Bright specifications state these are very efficient units (>90% max.) which is why I also tried this smaller unit for another need.This inverter is heavily built and on the outside seems like a quality unit.  When first powered up using the accessory outlet adapter, the unit ran my 75 watt current draw okay.  I then switched to a set of HD cables I use for the larger inverter (which probably had nothing to do with this issue) for another test with the same load and a few seconds later smoke and flames billowed out of the back for several seconds.  The green AC power LED in the front was still on and it may have been producing AC power, but I was busy shutting down the test and did not verify.For the money, this seemed like a great unit and it probably is.  Defects happen even to the best of items, but I replaced it with a 150 watt Tripplight which will travel better for its intended usage. 
Could a wheel chock chock is a wheel chock could chock wheels?In this case: 2.Good build quality, worked well on my AG tires on the rear of the tractor. very good Very good.... 
I realize that there are testimonials for this product actually doing what it says it will do.  I have not had an occasion to need it in an emergency.  AND - I hope that I never do.  It does not inspire confidence.  It feels like something that would be included in a child's toy tool set.  Extremely lightweight.  Directions state you must hit the window in a specific location - good luck with that in an emergency.  I was hoping for a tool with enough weight, which added to acceleration, would break the window.  Again, I have not used it, and I will not trust it in an emergency - so I will be looking for a better product.  I do not recommend this item...at any cost. I qualify 5 stars because it would be unfair to give a bad reputation, I purchased this product on September 27, I Bought 2 Armor extreme shine, I live in South America so I need an address where my purchases must arrived in the united States and then send to my country. My courier company said that they couldn&#8217;t transport Aerosol or contents under pressure because is a dangerous goods. I had to declare the product as abandoned, I lost my purchase. I will not be able to watch my shiny wheels, I'm sad about that, but I'm sure it's an excellent product because I have purchased other products of &#8220;Armor all&#8221; that are not dangerous goods and arrived without problems to my country where I check the good quality of their products. Another must have for the tool box.This is one of the best quality grease available. I only bought one tube because I don't need it often but when I do, its just a small amount. 
The directions are poorly written....the process did not work for me. I was very disappointed after reading so many positive reviews. This is a great product!  It brought back the original look and actually a nice satin-gloss look to my tires.I agree with other reviews, don't care for the Ultra Glossy finish some tire dressing produce and this is a restorer... it helps the rubber.  Just be aware that this is a strong and some what dangerous product, they warn that this can cause  cancer, and as a survivor of Melanoma from last year, I take this cautions seriously!  Just follow the directions, be safe, and enjoy the look this produces! Read some reviews on this before I purchased. Looks like on one of the reviews, someone bought the wrong one. I made sure I ordered the right one. There are 2 different styles. Now I can leave my gray valves opened to drain, while keeping the black valve closed. It was a great price too! 
As it turned out, only 1 front wiper blade was available for my car. So I took it as an opportunity to do a side-by-side between this wiper blade on one side of the windshield, and the dealer's stock wiper blade on the other.The Result?The side with the stock wiper blade streaked like crazy, while the side with this this Contour looked like it was squeegeed clean -- no streaks, no nuffin -- just a nice clear windshield.Why Contour?The name says it all -- the wiper blade's plastic spine is bendy, so the blade conforms perfectly to every car's unique curves and nuances. Perfect contact. Perfect wiping. No streaks. And nary a drop left behind. OH! So THIS is how wiper blades are supposed to work -- duh!Hands-down, my fave wiper blade. Now I just need to get a matching pair. These wiper blades feature a rubber booth which covers the joints holding the wiper blade. Meaning that no ice/snow/water can touch the joints so they are most unlikely to freeze.This allows the wiper blade itself to maintain its shape, the joints to still move and therefore allow the blade to stay closely to the windshield.I have been using them for years and always switch to them shortly before winter time. Very easy to install, they install in the same harness as regular blades. Taking them out of box, you could see that these blades are not the same as your normal wiper. Instead of the normal 3-4 support struts backing the blade, there is 1 long piece that runs parallel to the rubber part of the blade. This piece applies even pressure over all points of the blade, and the result is noticeable; There is almost NO smearing, and the blades are very quiet. 
Need one say more?  And, these can be locked in place using a small lock you put in the tightening head (lock not included).  Once in place between the wheels on a tandem axle trailer, there's no way the trailer will move.  Cool! This dogbone lock is very nice and well buildt. It is perfect for use on any car or truck if you are going to remove it after each use. But it is not for use on a motorhome reciver, were it is going to be left on for some time.The problem is ! The protective rubber cap that covers the key entry, fits loosely. The cap will not stay on to protect the key entry slot. Any little bump in the road, and off it comes !  Dirt and water gets into the lock mechanism, the key will not go in and you will not get it off with out a cutting torch. Tired of being charged WAY to much pretty much everywhere for a 5 min filter change? I got this for my 2008 prius and you can do the install yourself in under 5 min for almost nothing. Never pay $120 again at the dealer.Your CAF is located behind the glovebox. To get to it, you need to open your glovebox and let it sit open all the way. Empty out your glovebox. If you don't, you'll be cleaning up the contents of your glovebox from the floor when you're done replacing your CAF. Next step is to look on the right side and unhook the dampener. Next, squeeze the rear of the glovebox sides inwards to be able to let the glovebox swing all the way down.Looking inside, you'll see a tray with latches on both sides. Press those latches inwards and start sliding the tray out.When you put your new CAF into the tray, make sure you follow the arrow on the filter as the air is meant to flow through in one direction. The air flow is down. If you forget, the tray has an arrow on it also that says &#34;air flow&#34;.To finish the job, reverse the proceedures above. Slide the tray in, click into place, rotate the glovebox up and let it snap into place, replace the dampener bar, then close the glovebox. 
Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. I wish there was a guide somewhere that shows you what cars these sunshades fit. I bought this one (Super Jumbo) for my Toyota Camry, hoping it would fit. Well, it did not fit. I had to return it, and order the regular Jumbo sunshade. The regular Jumbo sunshade fits the windshield like a glove. Quality is good, and it folds up to about 14&#34;. So, if you have a 2007-2013 Toyota Camry, DO NOT BUY THIS ONE!!! Order the regular Jumbo size.Amazon, can you please look into getting some sort of reference guide that will show customers the correct vehicle application? This would make buying this product a whole lot easier.CPS This is a great little deterrent to thieves stealing your vanity license plates.  I'm happy.  It doesn't fit all cars.  Make sure it fits your car or else it might be too tight!! 
These refrigerator bars work well to keep your food from shifting around while driving down the road. They are adjustable and have strong springs which allow them to be moved and remain in place. The fridge in our camper did not come with any devices to keep food from moving around and we would often open the door after driving and have some of the contents spill out. These bars will prevent most of that from occurring. I've had Husky liners in several vehicles and swear by their fit and longevity. Only drawback is the tread depth is not particularly great. While the sides are adequate for keeping any slush you drag in confined to the liner, sometimes (but certainly not all the time) your shoes will be sitting in the mud/slush/water. No big deal to pull em out and dump em, but could be perfect with even just another 1/4 inch of tread depth.Other than that, the plastic is of perfect ridgity to mold to the contours of your Jeep and the colors are steadfast for a very long time. Have both the front and rear liners in my JKUS. This is a small but potentially seriously valuable tool in case you or someone else is involved in an auto accident.  As you can see in the photo there is a car key which lets you know this is not very large and is meant to be used on a keychain, which is likely the best place to keep it because if you are in an accident having access to the key still being in the ignition is more likely than any other place in my opinion.  It has two devices to help you out if you are in an automobile accident or if you are trying to help someone else that has been in an accident.  The first is a glass breaker.  Auto glass needs to be strong to undergo the rigors a car goes through, so it is not always easy to break.  This tool uses a self-loading spring action with a glass breaker spike inside the end of the round part on the bottom.  You push the bottom against the glass which takes 12 lbs. of pressure to accomplish which means you need to press it fairly hard, then when it reaches that level of pressure it releases a spring loaded spike which will cause auto glass to shatter thus allowing you to escape an accident should a door be jammed for example.  Or help someone else to escape a similar situation. This means you only have to be able to press this device against the glass hard enough to activate the spring, not hit it with a standard glass breaker with enough force to cause it to shatter.  I would suggest pressing the glass breaker up against a piece of cardboard or something similar so you will get an idea how hard you will need to press this against auto glass to get it to shatter if and when you actually need to use it, but not against a hard surface to prevent damage to the spike inside.  By having this on your keychain it is far more likely you will be able to reach it if sometime you really need it.This is made not made to break out a windshield.  Those have laminates sandwiched between two pieces of glass at will be held together by that plastic laminate.  The other windows in a car will shatter in to hundreds of tiny pieces when broke  It just takes enough force to get them to break.  The spring loaded spiked inside this is enough to cause the entire window to shatter which is what you want, especially if you are not in a condition to hit the window really hard with some other glass breaker which depends on you having enough strength after the accident to still have an arm free, reach the device and kit it hard enough to work.  I think you have a much better chance with the spring loaded devices as used in this tool.The second part is the seatbelt cutter.  There is a sharp blade that is inside the curved part of the unit.  It has a cap on it which needs to be removed to use, however when you have a key attached to it that gives you enough leverage to easily remove the protective cap and then you can cut yourself or someone else free from their seatbelt should you be unable to unbuckle them. You simply slide the seatbelt between the gap when the cap is removed and slide it to have the blade cut the belt, this is also made to prevent accidentally cutting yourself as the blade is inside the unit. I have not tested the blade on an actual seatbelt as I would not want to dull the blade in case I actually needed it.  It appears sharp enough to do the job though.  And while I usually have a sharp knife nearby if in an auto accident things get thrown around and the most likely item you will be able to reach is this tool attached to the key in the ignition.  It is purely a safety tool that hopefully you will never need.  But if you keep one on your keychain it will be there just in case you, or someone else you see in an accident needs it to escape a serious automobile accident.I don't see how you can afford NOT to buy one of these.  If you ever use it just once it will have been worth many times more than the price paid.  How much are the lives of yourself and your family worth to you?  How much would you be willing to pay to be able to cut your child free after a car crash to get them to safety.  Or to be able to break a window to escape a car you were trapped in?  I do not sell these and I hope nobody gets in a an auto accident.  But chances are that some of us will at some point and having one of these devices might make the difference between being able to escape or not.  Cheap insurance you hope you never need in my opinion. 
I bought this steering wheel cover to hide the peeling leather on my 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited steering wheel. I measured the inside dimensions of the wheel, 15". I did not have to heat or stretch the new wheel cover, it fit perfectly and looks great. It's also much easier to keep clean with interior protectant. 3 things.#1 Spring is cheep and installed incorrectly. Snapped on unpacking so i had to twist it to place it the right (better) way and twist the ends toward inside more, because spring is made of cheep metal that bends like aluminum.#2 Size is too big for regular car filters. Toyotas/Hondas/Motorcycles ETC. Maybe a 5Lite For 3500 utility van will have enough filter diameter for this to fit around, or a huge SUV or a pickup truck.#3 Removal only. does not work the other way around to tight the filter. The tires say 300 pound capacity and maybe that is what the rubber could support on a static load but these seem to be medium duty wheels. I purchased these wheels to replace the plastic wheels on a 5 HP chipper/shredder that weighs about 100 pounds and I tow behind a lawn tractor. For my application these wheels work well. The bearings are exposed and it seems that dust, dirt and water can get into the races. The metal wheel parts seem to be thin and I do notice that both have a slight wobble in them. For medium duty applications like my chipper it is ok. I would also use these wheels on my garden wagon and 5K watt generator. I would not use these wheels on a ride on mower that had to support my weight. I would use these wheels on the front free floating deck of my ride on mower.  A grease zerk fitting would have been nice on these wheels. 
This sunshade is easy to use and folds up to a nice compact size that fits under my seat well. It's a quite large size so is made for an SUV or car that has a large windshield like my Toyota Prius. While it doesn't fit the Prius perfectly, it's the closest size to being perfect.At this price, I have no complaints with this and can recommend it. Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. I purchased this to be able to attach a high-end hydraulic assisted bike rake on the back of my Jeeps (JKs) with the rear tire still on.  It fit perfectly and teamed with the Bolt Lock BLT7018448 5/8'' Receiver Lock (Keyed specifically for your line of vehicle) it can be kept in the Jeep and my daughter doesn't need anything but her car key.The extender is exactly as advertised, well made, fit perfectly and does eactly what it is inteded for. 
I have it hooked up to the SUV.  This actually works and will kick on every other day or so just to top off the battery.  It does get VERY warm when recharging a low battery so be careful where yo set it down...8-2013 UPDATE. The button to change the type vehicle its attached to starting NOT to work, no matter how hard you pushed on the button. It was returned directly to CTEK and replaced without incident (of course I had to pick up shipping to them).. Some times you need these battery clips instead of the rings. Both work equally well and get the job done. No place to store CD's - unless you unzip the portion you see with a map sticking out of it and put the cases in there.  I was replacing one with individual felt slots to store DVD's without the cases.  Can't do that here.The zippers open very easily though, and the mesh works great for a garage door opener.  I use the sunglasses spot for my gas card and gift cards.I like the adjustable straps since I have slightly larger than normal visors on my 2012 Nissan Juke and the one I was replacing was elastic straps that barely fit over it.  I kept waiting for them to snap and fall off.So as long as you only have a few things to get out of the way, this works alright. 
**Edit - If you take something away from my post, it is that automakers design cars to run on specific spark plugs. Buy whatever works great for you car, and avoid spark plugs that don't run well. These didn't work in my car, but everyone is different. Check forums to see what works best as well.**I drive a 1998 Honda Civic EX with a VTEC engine. I am currently running NGK V-Power spark plugs and the original factory spark plug wires. I bought these spark plugs to see fuel economy gains and maybe a power increase while merging onto the freeway.They work, but I couldn't tell they were new. MPG's for my car went down to 36, usually 38-40, and so the price didn't match the product well. What I can tell you is that using the right spark plug for your car is key, and trying to eeek out extra MPG's from spark plugs doesn't work so well. I tried Autolites, NGK, etc. iridium plugs and the traditional copper cores work the best. I get 45-50 mpg highway on standard spark plugs.So save your money (I think I spent $16-24 for the set, it's been a while since I returned them) and buy 3-4 sets of copper core NGK V-Power plugs or whatever fits your car.The other thing to note is that replacing severley worn spark plugs with these will net fuel economy gains, but putting any new plugs in will do that. Don't be fooled by these fancy plugs. Shop for your car and check what your car is recommended to use, because that is usually the best option. Your car's computer is programed for the original plugs, not different ones.It's your money, but read the reviews to see if it helps your specific car. It didn't do anything for mine.One plus is that Amazon is amazing with returns. I love this unit. Now I know in detail what's wrong with my car before I take it to the shop. This lessens the opportunity that the shop will try to upsell me on a service that I may not need. I also like the idea of being able to log the issues on my computer. I have used it on a 1993 Ford F150; 2001 Nissan Sentra; 3007 Lexus RX350 and a 2001 Cadi Deville Looks and fits the same for a 2000 Toyota Sienna van. I ordered extra so I will not be without any at a later date. 
This does what it says it does. It is really heavy and is a bit much to lug around, but overall good. This change pan weighs in a little heavy but that is a good thing, seems to be like all Lisle products and speaks of quality. Has performed fine and I see it being around for a long, long time as such. Large, easy to grasp thick well built handles gives you great control and not the sloshing effect of the auto parts stores thinner copies of this pan, there is no comparison. Spout is at a great angle too. I would definitely recommend this to anyone doing at home fluid changes. These seem well made and are as advertised.  Heavy yes but the construction seems worth the weight.  Look at the mfg weight rating.  While these seem strong enough for automotive work I would be leery for weight limits over recommendation.  I concur with all of the positive reviews. 
Pros: battery driven; flashing or steady light; flameless flare; can be used as a map light; reusable. Could be used effectively as a light that does not seriously degrade night vision.Cons: Product claims to be visible at 1000 ft, but this is only possible within a few degrees of view. One half of the top lights up for a dim presentation, but the bright LED shines out through a narrow beam like a small red flashlight. Consequently, the flare would probably not be useful in a traffic situation since it would have to be precisely aligned with oncoming traffic and would only be visible by the few drivers within this narrow beam of light. It is certainly not a good substitute for a real flare which is much brighter and omnidirectional. This little light is not as good as the emergency flashers built into vehicles.If you want a safety flare to carry in your vehicle, buy the real thing. If you want a light you can use as a map light without distracting a driver, or to see where you're walking without seriously degrading your night vision, this red light will do that well. If you have a vehicle - like I do - that turns off the cigarette lighter circuit when you remove the key, then this meter is limited in its usefulness. Sure you can see what's cooking just by inserting the meter and turning on the ignition (without starting the car). But, suppose you want to continuously monitor the battery while it's being trickle charged over a few days and you have removed the keys. Can't do. Still, the unit is well-made, accurate (I checked it against a high quality VOM) and easy to read. Makes easy work of filling your batteries. You don't have to see into the holes just push down and wait for the gurgling to stop.always the correct level.

Still, the unit is well-made, accurate (I checked it against a high quality VOM) and easy to read. Seems well made and works as it should. Like the fact it has the LED's which is a quick and easy way to see if your vehicles wiring is working as it should and can point you in the right direction if you may be having an issue with your trailers lights Oh, and the display can't be read in bright sunlight. That's the first thing I noticed when trying to use it, actually. I didn't know it was even on and working until I cupped my hands around the display to see that, indeed, my battery's voltage was in fact displayed. Very dimly. A better screen type would have been a great idea (in a garage, this likely wouldn't be an issue).This unit does two types of tests: one, with the car off, which tests the battery's voltage and (somehow) its cranking capacity. My van's 685CCA battery came in at 677, and got the green LED. All good there. It seems well built, and the clamps (permanently attached) are decent. Make sure you get a good connection to the battery posts, or the CCA reading will be inaccurately low (I had to adjust a few times to get it right).For part two, the charging system test, you kind of need a second person to do properly. One standing at the battery to watch the readout and control the test, and a 2nd person in the driver's seat to start the car, then keep it revved to 1200-1500 RPMs, and then turn on the vehicle's loads (hi-beam headlights + full-power fan + rear defroster recommended) for the load test. At each step, you press a button or two on the device to move it forward, and it doesn't store the voltage, so running back and forth from device to vehicle controls isn't ideal.The tester works well once you figure out how to navigate the device's menu and learn what the odd 4-letter contractions mean for various parts tests this thing can run (there's a cheat sheet on the back of the device). There had to be a more straightforward way to run through the steps though.Anyway, it's a handy device, and tells me more about the battery than just my multimeter did... but not that much more (just the current CCA cranking capability of the battery). If that extra bit of info is worth the cost of the device to you, then by all means get this tester. If you're okay just knowing voltage, and already have a multimeter, it tells you almost as much info as this device does, is far more "all purpose", and you can get one that will work fine for under ten bucks (harbor freight, etc). 
It meters a multitude of electrical values, while changing range automatically, and then displays them using digits.That said, the lag time necessary for auto-ranging is kind of annoying, and I now wish I had gone for a manually ranged model. Consider this...  The combine cost of your tow vehicle and trailer...  The combine weight of your tow vehicle and trailer...  The fact that your trailer may well weigh more than your tow vehicle...  And that moron that just jumped in your lane then slammed on his brakes...  This is NOT the time to think to yourself, "maybe I should've gotten a better brake controller."  Seriously, when the difference in cost is under $100, is it really not worth buying the best?I've used the Tekonsha P3 for two and half years now and I have nothing but praises to sing!  Features, user friendliness, and results!  This unit has it all.  First lets talk about the mechanism.  It uses a digital G-Sensor as apposed to a physical pendulem.  Why is this a benifit?  Because there are no downhill issues that you see with the physical and analog type sensors.  Prior to digial sensors, the downhill slope would throw off the pendulem and the brake controller either would send a weaker current to the brakes or none at all.  Some people have questioned the reliablity of digital sensors.  But with more than 10 years of full production digital units, complaints are actaully less than the older analog units.  Consider this as well, the sensor is not only quicker but more accurate as well, hard to soft braking is much safer now.  How does it work?  Just like any other accelerometor...it senses the volume deceleration and then computes an appropriate voltage and current to send to the trailer brakes based on a percentage of the user's max output setting.Let's talk interface.  A four button face with a roughly 1.5" LCD display plus a belly mounted manual switch.  With no brakes connected, this unit will dispay the default "Tekonsha Screen".  Once brakes are connected via the trailer plug, the unit will display the "Tow Screen".  It has a large two/three read out that displays 0.0 as a default.  While sitting still and once brake pressure is applied it will jump to approximately 10% of the max set output, after 3 seconds of being stationary it will move up to 25% power.  This is designed to "hold" the trailer if stopped on an incline or decline.  Setting the max brake power is a snap with the two "Up" and "Down" buttons on the left side of the face.  The value moves up and down by 0.1 increments and quite quickly if you hold the button down.  The last two buttons are "boost" and "page" which I will discuss when I talk features.  The last button is the manual brake override.  This bottom mounted spring loaded slider switch will manually add braking power to the trailer brakes (up to the user set max) even without depressing the vehicles brake peddle.  This is a standard feature on all brake contorllers, but I wanted anyone looking for their first brake controller to understand what this was.  Lastly, is the warning screen.  It's a deep red screen with a trailer and a "no" sign.  This indicates that the controller which had previously sensed brakes connected no longer can sense them.  Generally an indication of a poor trailer connection at the wiring harness or a problem with the brakes themsleves.Let's talk features.  I've mentioned the "Boost" button, but what is it?  There are 4 levels of boost for trailer brakes.  Off, LV. 1, LV. 2, & LV. 3.  Boost adds a brief (fraction of a second) burst to the trailer brakes which slows the trailer slightly more than the normal pressure would and keeps it from bumping or pushing the tow vehicle when brake pressure is initailly applied.  Very important if as many are these days, your trailer weighs more than your tow vehicle.  After the burst it returns the voltage and current to the G-sensors reccomended output.  There isn't a real scientific method for figuring what you need to use.  The picture on the home screen shows LV1 as small trailer, 2 as a med tailer, and 3 as a large trailer.  My trailer is a 6K lb. TT and I just leave it on the default LV. 1 boost.  Everytime the units is powered it returned to the default LV. 1.  The unit will power down after 15 mins with no trailer connected AND no input from the brake signal wire.  The "Page" button will take you to a second screen that you navigate with the "up", "down", and "Boost" (now "enter") buttons.  This sceen has some cool features as some useful features.  "Backlight" allows you to brighten or dim the brightness of the display.  "Color" lets you set the color of the display.  (Yeah I know, unessesary, but cool)  The default color is "White" which is more of a light blue.  There's also Magenta, Orange, Dk Blue, Violet, Lt. Green, and Dk. Green.  Red is not availible as it's reserved as a warning color for the "no trailer connection" warning screen.  Back to the page screen.  There's also a VERY USEFUL troubleshooting screen.  It lets you view diagnostics on the fly and over the road that can give you four digit readouts of battery voltage, stoplight (brake input signal) voltage, brake voltage, and brake current.  This screen alone is worth the cost of this brake controller!  When you first connect your tailer do some tests and record the max input you set, the output under normal braking conditions, as well as the brake voltage and amperage.  If down the line you get the feeling the brakes aren't working properly, you can re-run this test and see if it's an electrical problem or not.  Finally when your done, pressing the page button will return you to the "tow screen."Installation.  A snap for anyone that has a factory tow package.  Tekonsha offers plug and play wiring harnesses that plug into most make and model years of trucks.  If you have to have it installed or choose to install it yourself as I did, it can be challenging.  But it's a simple four wire hookup.  A 12V input from the battery (running thru a 30A auto reset breaker NOT a fuse), an output to the brake pin of your 6 or 7-way trailer connector, a stoplight input running to your vehicle's stoplight switch behind the brake peddle, and lastly a frame ground.  The mount can be a little challenging to install because of the akward access to the screws, but it can be mounted at nearly any angle other than strait up or down and provided the face is facing a close to directly rearward as possible.All in all, this is probably the most important review I've ever done.  This controller will save you grief and keep you and your vehicle safe.  Make sure for your safety, your families safety, and the safety of all those on the road you buy the brake controller that does it's job the best.  Buy the Tekonsha P3. I purchased this charger because I termed it 'smart' because of all of the different charging modes it employs.  The deciding factor for this particular model is that it has the constant voltage that you can use when you disconnect the battery to clean the terminals or change the battery.  More important to me than the radio presets are the engine control module settings.  It's nice not having to wait for the computer to relearn the particular variations of settings from the default ones. 
It works well for a few days and after that I have to dump my tank and deposit more Bio-Paks. I just don't know, I may be doing something wrong. But, I don't think so because I am following the directions on the package. If any one has some tips please post them.................... UPDATE AS OF 8/26/2013 AT THE BOTTOM:I haven't had this long enough to gauge durability, but will make sure to come back in time, and update this review with reliablity.  The review can loose stars in the future if I have issues, but it works fine for me at this time.I use this exclusively for indicating the state of charge on my sealed lead acid battery in my Little Guy, Silver Shadow camping trailer while it is disconnected from the tow vehicle.I have no need for the feature that tells you if an alternature is charging properly in a car.Although it has 3 LED lights indicating the state of charge for those that aren't familiar with voltage levels versus charge on a lead acid battery, I plan on just using the digital readout to tell the level of charge on my battery after a night of running the "Fantastic fan"Just FYI, when I first plugged the unit in the volage read 12.44 and both the green and yellow LEDs were lit.Voltage levels versus state of charge are as follows, but I think this info is also on the package.  I have this device stored in the trailer at the storage area, so I can't remember.12.7=100%12.5=90%12.42=80%12.32=70%12.20=60%12.06=50%11.9=40%11.75=30%11.58=20%11.31=10%As I said, I think that info might be on the package, but I didn't have that handy, so I got that data from battery university.FYI, never run your gelled cell below 20 percent, and not below 50% would be preferable.I'll update if I have any issues.  Right now it is stored in a hot trailer, so that should give it a good heat test, and I would think bouncing around in the trailer while it is being towed should tell us how durable it is.I'll come back and update this review after some camping trips.Update:  I have had the device for over month now, with it baking in the hot trailer when it isn't in use, and it bouncing around inside the trailer when it is towed, and I can say so far, it works as advertised.  I am satisfied with this purchase so far.Mark Well this thing is as easy as tying your shoes laces. Plug in two wires, let it sit there for a few seconds and BOOM, it works. I still have to wait to fill up so I can calibrate that portion but everything else is good to go. This thing tells you everything you want to know about your vehicle components and more. The X-gauge is an awesome addition to an already great product. You can go the their website and review how to program the X-guages that are compatible with your specific vehicle. Don't wait like I did. Order this NOW!!! As usual Amazon came through with the shipping. If you don't want take my word for it, just look at the 300+ people that purchased it before me. Now I know exactly what my actual and average gas mileage is for my truck. 
This little gadget keeps my lift handle paired up nicely when mounted to my vehicle. It can get in the way when jacking, but it is easily solved by just pulling it up onto the d hook on the top. This makes strapping down a bike easy! Don't have to try to find a good place to strap the tie-downs to! Keeps the tie down straps away from the bike so it won't scratch up your motorcycle! Love it! This product is well made and comes in handy when you want to climb out of your Jeep. It is easy to put on and does its job very well. The size of the grip itself is perfect as your hand can wrap around it, for a good surface to hold onto, instead of grabbing onto the roof. 
The battery was dead.  Dead dead.  Apparently being parked for months without use, the clock and the alarm slowly killed my battery.  But this thing brought it back from the other side in short time.  Very pleased. I have aWagan Power Dome EX 400-Watt Jump Starter with Built-In Air Compressorthat is a permanent tool in one of our family car. That unit's quality was highly questionable. Finally on the third replacement I had a good one. It had the features I wanted: compressor (for kids bikes, balls), inverter, USB power, and jumper. It was a worthy compromise of battery power and features.But I want a second unit, with focus on a battery that can power my electronics longer and jump a car. This model seems to allow longest running of electronics out of all battery-based units with inverter/jumper.When this unit arrive, I expected to charge for 48 hours per instruction. But seems like the unit was already fully charged before shipping out. Within minutes, the charging status showed solid green and battery status reported 100%. That's nice when they can charge it (Amazon warehouse?) before shipping it out.First test powering my more power-hungry laptops (80 watts), LCD monitors, portable fans, etc. I'm happy to report the expected duration is quite accurate. For example, one of my appliance that averages 75 watt runs for about 2 hours and 20 minutes. 100 watt electronics ran for 2 hours.*SIDE NOTE* One of my favorite thing is to power my PS3 console in this marvelous gaming case:GAEMS Halo UNSC Vanguard Personal Gaming Environment (Xbox NOT Included)As for starting a car with dead battery, I had the opportunity to tested just 2 days after receiving it. I had left my car's lights on in the morning, and by start of evening the battery was not strong enough to start the car. After connecting the jumpers, the first two cranks resulted in no go. After waited for 5 minutes, I started the car again and the car started without any hesitation.What this means to me that the rated crank amp of 350CA is not strong enough to jump start most cars with a "dead" battery. (I think AAA guy once told me average cars need 600 - 700 crank amps).  Even my Wagan 400 watt inverter (with 600 crank amps) couldn't get car started on first try many times.  If it cannot start immediately, don't panic! Wait a few minutes!  A car battery is technically dead at 12V, and fully charged at 12.6 - 12.8V. So by letting the powerpack to charge the car battery for 5 - minutes, it frequently is enough to raise the voltage close to 12.6 to start the car.Anyway, it's a good start for me on this battery. But time will tell if the battery can retain charge to be useful for at least two years. Will update here in a few months. The flooded battery for my riding mower wouldn't hold a charge for more than day, regardless of whether it was trickle-charged with a battery tender or charged in recovery mode with my Diehard Platinum charger.  Skeptical, I ordered this after reading that it was both reliable and had the potential to revive an otherwise useless battery.9 hours of charging later ... and my riding mower battery now holds a charge.  I also put a ring terminal comfort indicator onto the mower battery and deliberately let the mower sit ... and the battery moved from green to yellow (fully charged to less than 80% charged) across a week ... instead of full discharge in a single day.I probably need a new battery for the riding mower, but this charger bought me time AND proved its worth -- doing what my $90 Diehard Platinum charger could not. 
I used this controller to replace the horrible factory dodge controller in my 2010 ram 2500. This controller is worlds ahead of the factory controller in terms of features and available settings. If you are hauling a large trailer it is a must have. The boost function is a great feature that applies the trailer brakes ahead of the truck brakes. You can set boost to 3 levels to meet your desired brake feel. My fiver weighs around 2500lbs more than my truck and between this controller and the exhaust brake stopping is effortless. I have installed a transmission cooler in my FJ Cruiser and use this scan tool/gauge to monitor the transmission temperatures in the pan and at the converter control valve sensor. Having the rig set up for towing, this product is a very valuable asset, plus you can watch various other parameters and sensor reading, MPG`s, etc etc and use it also as a scan tool...Excellent product! Consider this...  The combine cost of your tow vehicle and trailer...  The combine weight of your tow vehicle and trailer...  The fact that your trailer may well weigh more than your tow vehicle...  And that moron that just jumped in your lane then slammed on his brakes...  This is NOT the time to think to yourself, "maybe I should've gotten a better brake controller."

Perfect for washing the RV...strong pole you can scrub as high as you need to go or can leverage. Holds its position when set.  Very pleased. Pros - As described, heavy duty, well madeCons - Have not used it yetLooks heavy duty and easy to use.  Have not had to use it yet so can not say how durable it will be.It is one of those safe guards for my Harley Sportster, now if I have a flat I can fix it. I use Stoner's Invisible Glass strictly when detailing cars (others or my own). It doesn't streak and applies well. It's alcohol based, so its safe for window tint (unlike ammonia-based products such as Windex). Unlike other Stoner's products, it can be purchased in a traditional spray bottle rather than a pressurized can. Great product! 
This baby right here is an excellent  wheel scrubbers for trucks, some convertibles, and sedans.  Using at the same time with some tire cleaners, it made cleaning out the wheels and rims a breeze. However two this I didn't like about the giant furry mace. One, it has a metal clip on the top of the brush, so if you're not careful, you can do serious damage. Two, it's huge! I mean you can sword fight with someone with this thing when the time comes. It can be handy for large tires, but damn, it's like the brush when manufactured took steroids. But overall it is a nice LARGE brush of the century. With my new wheels I needed a tire iron to be able to reach how deep my bolts are in the wheel now.  This tool came with everything I needed.  It covers both size deep well sockets and an extension.  The telescopic handle is great for space saving to store in the truck.  It is also nice that it will fit standard sockets and is not just once size socket for the whole tool.I gave it 4 stars because I certainly trust the tool for an emergency but don't think it would make a great tool to use day in and day out.  Hopefully that make sense.  Also the bag that comes with it is thin flimsy plastic.  I didn't even bother with the bag. It feels like it's made of great quality stuff.  It's very sturdy and not flimsy like some other funnels out there.  I recommended this funnel In conjunction with this item &#34;RhinoGear 05068 3 piece Funnel Set&#34;I use this to top off transmission fluid in vehicles.  Comes in very handy!!! 
This brush is very stiff and does a great job of cleaning tough parts. I use it to clean electric motors and transmissions and the brush doesn't fall apart using different type of solvents It is great. I just add it to the reservoir along with the regular washer fluid.  It does work very close to the original spray, so i won't say no to it.  The repellent effects stay on and does the job well. Buy it. i've tried really cheap wheel cleaner and this brand as well as meguiars, they all work the same. mother wheels cleaner doesnt clean the tires well, does clean the rims if you use the appropriate brush. its ok..... 
This is a useful device to have in your car but you must understand it's limitations. In many cars, it will not be as accurate as taking a reading directly off your battery, which you can do with this device, if you buy this inexpensive additional adapter:Roadpro 12V Battery Clip-On and Cigarette Lighter AdapterThe reason for this is that in vehicles where you have to turn on the ignition to ACC in order to power the cigarette lighter port, once you do that, the vehicle's electronics are also powered and will draw power. So, you will see a lower reading on this device than if you take a reading directly from the battery with the key out of the ignition. In vehicles where the lighter port is always powered, this device can be more accurately used directly plugged in to that port.However, for taking a reading of your charging circuit with the engine running, this can be used in the lighter port in any vehicle.Note that you can do all of this with any household multimeter however the chances of you having that in the vehicle are slim. Most all multimeters also require a battery in them so even if you store one of those in your vehicle, the chances are high that when you need to use it, the internal battery will be dead.This Equus unit however requires no internal battery (at least I don't think it has one), so you can just throw it in your glovebox indefinitely.Car batteries typically last around 5 years so after about 3.5 years is when you may want to periodically use this device to check the health of your battery. Basically, anything under 12v after the vehicle has been sitting for at least 4 hours is a sign the battery should likely be replaced. Above 12v and the battery is probably fine as long as the vehicle starts up.When a friend or relative asks me to check their battery, the first question I ask them is "Does your cigarette lighter port work all the time, or just when you put the key in the ignition and turn on the car?". If they say it's always on, I know I can pretty adequately test their battery just through the lighter port. If however they say it only turns on when they put their car to ACC, I know I will have to have them open their hood so I can read the battery directly with the Equus.The other good thing about this is that you could leave it plugged in all the time for a constant monitoring of your electrical system voltage while driving and parked.For the price, this device is nice to have if you understand how to use it.If you want a more robust battery tester that can not only give you the voltage, but also the CCA rating (cold cranking amps), I recommend this:SOLAR BA7 100-1200 CCA Electronic Battery and System Tester Handy little compressor that everyone should own. I haven't used the auto shutoff yet since I like to check my own pressures with a gauge anyways. Having it run off 110V is handy too so you don't need to have your car so close for the 12V plug in. This thing is Awsome.  It has all a camper or over the road traveler needs for emergency power and presurized air.  Comes with Battery Cables, Air Pressure Hose and Coinnections, Instruction Booklet (a must read), and several types of power outlets.  You will need an electrical extension cord, which is not included, to charge it up via AC Outlet, or you can charge it up via the 12Volt Auto Lighter Adapter Cord, which is included, but which I would not recomend unless you have no other source of power, because this thing looks like it packs a punch.  I like it and think it's worth the money.  I just started using it so Icannot speak to its durability, bt otherwise it is Awsome.  Recomend. 
I was a touch skeptical. But I can afford to throw it out if I don't like it.  Well I can say, I will NOT be throwing this out!  I was so impressed with how my cars looked when I was done that I had to ask my self. Why didn't I buy this sooner. And it is true. A little goes a long way. I don't find these plugs to be spectacular or anything.  I don't notice any better fuel economy or anything else for that matter.  I imagine they're better for my bike since the ones I took out were extremely dirty and burnt looking.  I replaced them for peace of mind mainly, not because I was having any issues.  I bought the bike used and figured it needed a tune-up anyway. I truly don't know why I waited so long to get one of these. Take the guess work outta knowing weather your tires need replacing or will pass inspection. Can't go wrong with this one. 
I did not install yet.  It looks like it will work fine.  I'll let you know when I am done.Update is that it works as intended! Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.  The pickle fork is the last resort for me, as it will damage the balljoint boot.I prefer to use the Snap On balljoint remover.  If that one cannot fit, then I will try this tool.  If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork. I haven't really used it yet for the reason intended, changing the oil in my jet ski.  So, I can't comment on how well it works.  The main reason for this review is to put it out there that it does not work with a 2000 Chevy Silverado.  The siphon tube does not fit thru the bottom of the dip stick tube.  It would be really nice if Mityvac had a published list of what vehicles it works with and what ones it does not.  I have my fingers crossed that it'll work with my jet ski, otherwise there will be a new/(un)used Mityvac on *****'slist.  Long story short, do your research to see if you can confirm or deny if it will work with your vehicle before you buy it. 
I used this product on my spark plug boots when I replaced the plugs on my 1999 Toyota Corolla about 6 months ago. About 4000 miles later and everything is still working fine. haven't used mine yet. Just got it everything seems to be working fine looks and good.I purchased this charger cause I have a Ford F 250 Super Duty with a diesel. A friend of mine has this same charger and it works flawlessly and will start this diesel when the batteries are dead.the only time u have a dead battery and need a jump nobody's ever around. So no more calling someone for a jump. Bought one for my car about four years ago. Still using it so got one for my riding mower. Mounted it on the mower so I just plug in, which is great in the cooler months.  I'm in south Louisiana and still have to mow in late November but infrequently, so this keeps it fully charged.  I've had the one o. The mower for a couple seasons now and it's still ticking away. 
Sure the switch placement sucks,but I do like the pump overall.I can plug in to a 120 outlet or use the 12 volt car accessory outlet. It does what it is supposed to do, that is to increase placement distance from the car to the electrical outlet I got a power plug to power plug style &#34;jumper&#34; device for my daughter, in case the 12V battery on her Prius dies.  Since the Prius doesn't use the 12V battery to start the motor, she doesn't need real jumper cables.  However, it's a keyless ignition, so she will not be able to jump power plug to power plug.  The battery on the Prius is has small terminals, so these are a nice size and should do the job of getting power from someone else's light to her battery. 
Just a spark plug, fits my Chinese scooter engine (I have a TaoTao ATM50 A1), but there are many brands using this same Honda clone engine.Has a small center pin, and the right gapping from the factory.Supposedly lasts a long time, can't say as I use it as a backup plug. Wired in easily, mounted easy also.  Brake control is so very different from the older systems I am used to for work, this is very intuitive and finite adjustments make towing our large camper a breeze.  I have reccomended this to my brother and a couple friends, who installed it and love it as much as I do. I bought this in conjunction with spark plugs and anti seize and it worked great to dial in the plugs. 
A snap to install, and easily transferred from one vehicle to another. I couldn't believe all the information that you can get off of the car's computer system. I originally purchased this to use in conjunction with myEquus 3721 Battery and Charging System Monitorbecause I wanted to get an accurate reading of my car battery's voltage. Using that device plugged directly in the the lighter port was not accurate because my car's electrical system is all powered up along with the lighter port.I also use this adapter now when using my car vac (with engine running) as well. It can also be used with powerful air compressors that would normally blow the lighter fuse in your car as this enables you to plug those directly to the battery, bypassing the car's fuses. Now we  do not have to move it  from car to car. These units work well and are accurate. Recommend one for all your vehicles. 
I have it hooked up to the SUV.  This actually works and will kick on every other day or so just to top off the battery.  It does get VERY warm when recharging a low battery so be careful where yo set it down...8-2013 UPDATE. The button to change the type vehicle its attached to starting NOT to work, no matter how hard you pushed on the button. It was returned directly to CTEK and replaced without incident (of course I had to pick up shipping to them).. Pays for itself the first time you clear out a pointless CEL.  Super easy to use, powers itself off the car, so no batteries.  Just plug it in, read the codes and look them up in the book, then reset them. I Love it  . Takes a while to break in until then you may get some wax streaks and not pick up all the dust but within a month it is perfect and like they say only improves the dirtier it becomes just shake off outside before putting back in the case and stuffing it in the trunk or map pocket . 
Used it to dry a machine washed car. Soaked up water easily and quickly. Soft and easy to grab while using. The wash mitt is soft and holds a lot of wash water, which keeps the car well soaked. I've used the mitt twice now and have gotten scratch-free results both times. I've also washed the mitt twice and air dried it and it has come out soft and like new. After some 30 years of washing cars, I finally figured out the secret: a giant stack of microfiber cloths. I use these on the windows with window cleaner, on the interior with 303 Aerospace Protectant, and the body after washing and waxing. The trick is having enough cloths that you can always grab a clean one whenever you might want. And you can toss them in the wash and restock the pile!48 cloths has been enough for full detailing of two cars and several quick washes. I still have about a third of the pile left. 
I have aWagan Power Dome EX 400-Watt Jump Starter with Built-In Air Compressorthat is a permanent tool in one of our family car. That unit's quality was highly questionable. Finally on the third replacement I had a good one. It had the features I wanted: compressor (for kids bikes, balls), inverter, USB power, and jumper. It was a worthy compromise of battery power and features.But I want a second unit, with focus on a battery that can power my electronics longer and jump a car. This model seems to allow longest running of electronics out of all battery-based units with inverter/jumper.When this unit arrive, I expected to charge for 48 hours per instruction. But seems like the unit was already fully charged before shipping out. Within minutes, the charging status showed solid green and battery status reported 100%. That's nice when they can charge it (Amazon warehouse?) before shipping it out.First test powering my more power-hungry laptops (80 watts), LCD monitors, portable fans, etc. I'm happy to report the expected duration is quite accurate. For example, one of my appliance that averages 75 watt runs for about 2 hours and 20 minutes. 100 watt electronics ran for 2 hours.*SIDE NOTE* One of my favorite thing is to power my PS3 console in this marvelous gaming case:GAEMS Halo UNSC Vanguard Personal Gaming Environment (Xbox NOT Included)As for starting a car with dead battery, I had the opportunity to tested just 2 days after receiving it. I had left my car's lights on in the morning, and by start of evening the battery was not strong enough to start the car. After connecting the jumpers, the first two cranks resulted in no go. After waited for 5 minutes, I started the car again and the car started without any hesitation.What this means to me that the rated crank amp of 350CA is not strong enough to jump start most cars with a "dead" battery. (I think AAA guy once told me average cars need 600 - 700 crank amps).  Even my Wagan 400 watt inverter (with 600 crank amps) couldn't get car started on first try many times.  If it cannot start immediately, don't panic! Wait a few minutes!  A car battery is technically dead at 12V, and fully charged at 12.6 - 12.8V. So by letting the powerpack to charge the car battery for 5 - minutes, it frequently is enough to raise the voltage close to 12.6 to start the car.Anyway, it's a good start for me on this battery. But time will tell if the battery can retain charge to be useful for at least two years. Will update here in a few months. This battery tender Jr. is great for anything you want to store or have ready for cold winter.The technology is state of the art.I have one Battery tender "senior'which has twice the power to charge my stuff fast,and three Jr's to keep a motorcycle,Gel battery Miata,and emergency generator in check.The jr's have half the "juice",but unless you want a faster charge(8hrs vs. 16 hrs on a dead battery,you can do just fine with the Jr's.A couple things to note.The Jr's come with aligator clips and ring clips,the Senior only comes with ring clips,so make sure you add the alligator clips with your order.Keep in mind every battery is in a different state of service,depending on age etc., so make sure you check the battery after about 6hrs the first time you use the tenders.If the battery is warm,you probably want to keep close watch on your charging,its probably the battery.Packaging and delivery are as good as can be(Amazon direct).Get one soon ,or two or three! Tested on a discharged battery and it charged it over night. Great for your boat/bike or anything that you need to charge over night for use the next day. If your looking for a charger that charges in 10 mins. this is not the one. Great product, and shipping. Thanks Amazon 
After using the very best and most expensive products from the world over this product is on top of them all.Make several applications like every week for the fisrt month latter once a month for 3 months after that every 6 months: better than new!! Purchased a set of these wipers for my wife's Rav 4 March of 2012.  As rainy season was about over, decided to keep them in the garage until a couple of days ago.  Installed them easily.Fired them up to try them,,,,windshield was wet from morning dew.  Streaked badly.However drove off with them on as was in a hurry and felt that I would deal them later.Later yesterday, got a bit of rain.  Turned them on, they streaked so badly that almost unable to see at all,,,,the left side far worse than right side.Windshield is clean and smooth,,,,no roughness or defects.Today I called Rain-X support  1-800-416-1600 and spoke to a lady named Adrian.Told her of my issues.  She asked when purchased.  I said March 2012 and installed a couple of days ago.  She then said that there blades were only good for 6 to 12 months.  I told her that had been stored.  She asked if in "temperature controlled environment"?. I said in the garage where temp never exceeds 85 degrees and were kept in original packaging in a dark closet.  She said that was the problem.I told here that the original wipers on the Toyota Rav 4 were 3 years old and still functioned better than Rain-x that were 6 months old, stored properly,,,not exposed to elements and never used, and yet were far worse in smearing of windshield than the old originals.She then told me that they have 90 day warranty and with receipt I could return.  I said that I purchased 6 months ago and had kept for when I would need them.  She said that was too bad and there was nothing that could be done,,,,,that my improper storage was why they failed.I asked her if 3 year old originals that had been used and baked in the sun and elements were superior to Rain-X blades that had been stored properly for 6 months and unused.  She said that she was not suggesting that at all.As an aside,,,,made in Korea, assembled in China.Cannot understand why Rain-X even provides a Customer Support number,,,,as there certainly is no support here. If Adrian was my employee, I could can her as she truly is inept.Likely the worst product that I've ever purchased. Admittedly, I'm not a huge fan of car accessories; in fact, I've been known to go years rather than months in between wiper replacements. But, last year I tried out some new blades and was really amazed at the difference so since that time, I've tried to make a point of keeping wipers in good working order.The ones on the current vehicle were a bit more than a year old but in Florida the harsh sun and daily thunderstorms combined with love-bugs, leaves, pollen and consuming sunshine means wipers get put through the paces. Mine were streaking up a storm and even more irrating...squeeking. I HATE squeeking!So, this came up for review; arrives promptly, takes about 1 minute to install (literally). No squeeking, no streaking. I'm a happy camper! 
Solidly built adapter. Allows me to plug my trailer into the garage when using the lights, charging the batteries or cooling the fridge. A must have for the RVer. It is a battery in a box that will help you jump start vehicles.  Love the plug and leave it charging.  This unit, at least the one I got, has the built in self charger that will not allow over charging of the battery.  I also like the fact it does not have all the gadgets the other unit out there have.  They filled the space in this unit with a bigger battery!! I got a power plug to power plug style &#34;jumper&#34; device for my daughter, in case the 12V battery on her Prius dies.  Since the Prius doesn't use the 12V battery to start the motor, she doesn't need real jumper cables.  However, it's a keyless ignition, so she will not be able to jump power plug to power plug.  The battery on the Prius is has small terminals, so these are a nice size and should do the job of getting power from someone else's light to her battery. 
How can one really rate it, as it is used for protection and no idae how long it should last, yet is was as listed so I give it the benifit ogf the doubt... This is not a booster pack for people who don't know how to use one. There's no safety features. No off switch. No silly blinking lights and pumps and sirens. It's meant to start a dead vehicle and that's exactly what it does. The long cables make it easier to use than some others as well. The voltage gauge is a great feature too, as it lets you know how much is left in it rather than just a couple lights. I required an ammonia-free window cleaner for my tinted windows. This does the job quite nicely. It isn't how well it does, rather how safely it does it. 
This sunshade is easy to use and folds up to a nice compact size that fits under my seat well. It's a quite large size so is made for an SUV or car that has a large windshield like my Toyota Prius. While it doesn't fit the Prius perfectly, it's the closest size to being perfect.At this price, I have no complaints with this and can recommend it. I bought a competing company's expensive MF drying towel and it was way too big and didn't seem to hold as much water as this. This towel is the perfect size, big enough to hold lots of water but small enough to not drag on the ground and for you to wring it out easily. Highly recommended. These are the perfect size - thin and not too much surface area to make them bulky to store.  can't wait to use them!

have this permanently hooked up to my car battery.  when car sits long time, I just plug it in and works perfect.  have 1 for each car, never fails. We have cars with full of electronic gadgets so they consume significant electricity, even when car is being driven. Almost every week we get no start due to weak battery. I have an external car battery charger (old). It is bulky to setup to charge cars overnight. Also it does not have any detection, so the battery can be continuously overcharged, which will eventually damage the battery (as multiple battery experts tell me). Never learned our lesson as we had 3 quality batteries purchased and replaced - each within 2 years.After reading all the great reviews, I bought one of these on-board charger and installed in one of the car that frequently dies (even with new battery). Now I can just plug in to the wall when car is parked each night, and unplug in the morning before the commute. No need to check if charging is complete if not driven for days! Also it will reduce the risk of not able to start the car to almost none.I will be buying another one for our other electronic gadgets-heavy car...  The next convenient thing is to find a good retractable power cords that can either be installed in the car with the on-board charger, or to the outlets for which the charger will be tapping power from. Bought this to keep the battery fully charged when I store my mustang for the winter.  Does a great job at keeping it charged and if I ever try to turn the car on it starts up right away.  With new cars constantly draining the batteries, I think this is a must if your car sits for more than a week. 
I liked the towel.  I have several microfiber towels with a softer nap and much prefer them to this towel. I would recommend these towels.We use them, and microfiber is one towelthat won't put scratches and swirl marks in a paints finish.All microfiber works well but low price towels may notresult in the best quality product.If you buy cheap you get cheap, and my car deserves the best.Show Car Guys 3 - Pack Of Ultra Blue Plush Microfiber Towels 16" x 16 "- At 360 GSM, This Is One Of Our Best Microfiber Cleaning Cloths-It Has Ultra Plush Micro Fiber Material On One Side, And The Other Side Consists Of Medium Terry Microfiber Material. These are not so much even coat applicators as they are buffing cloths to polish the wax coat you put on your car.  They are double sided so you can use one side on half you car and then flip and do the rest.  Machine washable too.  They are microfiber cloth wrapped sponges pretty much. 
The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around! Very quick and easy mounting and really adds to the look of the rear of the Jeep.  These are metal and not a cheap plastic and mount with included screws into the existing lens cover screw holes. Needed to replace a broken mirror.  This one fit right onto the existing metal holder that was still cemented to the windshield.  It has a lock-screw to hold it in place.  If you need to replace the metal holder, it is included but no glue is supplied.  Overall, it is a perfectly fine basic mirror. 
This is an OEM product for many Japanese vehicles.  Great price.  As a dealer, I can buy at a good price from the auto supply, this is a better price. I bought this for my 97 f150 and was very surprised at the cheap price for a quality price. very impressed! This is a great price for the cover and the filter.I paid less than $9 for both and they are OEM replacement parts.Great deal 
I ordered this set of mirrors to help me see behind my camper.  They are very easy to use and are very firmly mounted.  IMPORTANT: Go to the manufacturer's website to find the exact model for your truck.  The Amazon site might tell you the wrong model for your truck.  I recommend this product. Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars I wish there was a guide somewhere that shows you what cars these sunshades fit. I bought this one (Super Jumbo) for my Toyota Camry, hoping it would fit. Well, it did not fit. I had to return it, and order the regular Jumbo sunshade. The regular Jumbo sunshade fits the windshield like a glove. Quality is good, and it folds up to about 14&#34;. So, if you have a 2007-2013 Toyota Camry, DO NOT BUY THIS ONE!!! Order the regular Jumbo size.Amazon, can you please look into getting some sort of reference guide that will show customers the correct vehicle application? This would make buying this product a whole lot easier.CPS 
Because the original rain gutters were so small and out dated the extension you could buy on the market just didn't fit at all. Instead of opting for extensions we bought these and installed them. I am glad I did! Installation was a breeze and the instructions were more than sufficient. As long as your RV is level you should have no problems with drainage. Fits great, and I love that i don't have to have the key in it to make it lock. I have to do that with the Master coupler and hitch lock that i use when transporting. While I haven't had my 2013 Rubi in enough trouble to test these things out (I supposed I could use a hammer??), they feel very sturdy once installed. And they don't sit directly on top of the light as there are spacers installed. A common complaint, however, is that they do use the same screw holes. But, to be perfectly honest (this is the Internet...where everyone is honest, right??) I bought these more for their cool appearance than the protection they might offer. There. I said it ;-) 
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Even though Amazon says it does not fit my truck; it does fit my 2002 Chevrolet 2500HD crew cab with 6.0L gas engine. I replaced both sensors and harness. Both sensors were rough looking and the rear sensor had standing water on it. It was a little bit of a chore to get to them because you have to remove the intake but it was not too bad. Perfect fit for rear window on my 2004 Ford Excursion Limited. Easy to install. No spotting seen or squeaking at all 
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. I put these in my '03 TJ Jeep Wrangler.  They fit perfect and work exactly as you'd expect they should.  I installed a set of 55w HIDs in them and the light output is tremendous. Though Amazon stated this cap would not fit my 2013 Ford E-450 chassis (for a Jayco, Class C, Greyhawk, RV), I ordered it anyway as it fits many other years of Ford trucks and looks the same. It is rare for the same vehcle to change a design like that. It, in fact, fits perfectly. Our RV gas filler has no cover (not that that is a deterrant) and 60 gallons is a target for remote theft of gas, or a target for vandalism. This cap fits well. I have not been able to fit the stock cap-retainer onto it yet. I understand these modern vehicles have anti siphon plugs but one can still end up with foreign substances in the exposed fill-tube. This is a good 'ounce of prevention'.Highly recommended.

This is the review I did when these filters were sold in "packs of 2" There are some mistakes which i will highlight in brackets.These filters (PL20195) were bought as a replacement for the Toyota filters that are found on the 2.5L D-4D diesel engine in the Toyota Hilux pickup truck. They are of a very high quality as judged by the sealing gasket, the anti-drain back valve and its weight.Filter is being used with Mobil 1 Delvac 15W-40 (edit: it was actually 5W-40) Fully Synthetic engine oil and the engine noise has certainly reduced from its previous dino based lubricant.In my country, the Toyota dealership(TTTL) charges about US$28 for one filter; purchasing online and having the filters shipped cost me about US$13 for one.I highly recommend this filter as a high quality replacement that doesn't break the bank or if you plan to extend oil drain intervals.Now the technical stuff for people that want to know:PL20195 = PL20064 minus the pressure relief bypass valve (exactly the same dimensions)PL20195 is a longer version of the PL10241PL20064 is a longer version of the PL10028 (edit: the PL10028 doesn't have an antidrainback valve)The larger the filter usually means:1)that it takes longer for the oil pump to fill it.2)that there is more filter medium to trap more contaminants out of your oil3)that the oil will pass through the filter medium slower4)theoretically that a higher RPM will be required to activate the filter bypass valve (which means that you can rev your engine slightly higher without the oil bypassing the filter medium) - this really depends on the PSI that the pressure relief valve was designed with, but if a small filter and a larger filter have the same PSI value for the "relief" then this theory should hold true.Today the filter is currently being used with Shell Rimula R4 15W-40 for 8000Km oil change intervals This filter is as good as Toyota OEM filter. in comparison with OEM filter, the dimension is exact the same and actually Fram filter had 2 extra fold in the element which it means it can trap more particle than OEM filter. It come complete with all necessary o-rings and drain adaptor.The price in AMAZON is even few cents cheaper than Wal-Mart. I just installed this filter (Fram CH9972) in a 2009 Toyota Highlander 4-cyl.  The filter and the o-rings fit fine.  This filter element looked very similar to the used element I pulled out of the filter housing.  I purchased the filter element from Walmart for ~$6-$7, all local auto parts stores had this filter for $11-$14.  I also purchased from Amazon theK-D Tools 3253 End Cap Oil Filter Wrenchto remove the filter housing.I followed the instructions from a YouTube video "2008 Highlander Oil Change".  The video is for 6-cyl engine, but the process for 4-cyl is very similar, except that you do not have to remove anything to access the filter housing.  The filter housing is just behind the bumper cover.The process is a bit more complicated and messier than replacing a spin-on oil filter, but nothing too difficult to prevent me from doing it again.I gave this filter 4-star rating because there are higher efficiency filters for this application, e.g. Purolator PureOne PL25608, which also seems to have better construction.  Unfortunately, I could not find one for sale locally and it would cost $20+ from AdvancedAutoParts with S&H;, so buying Fram CH9972 made the most sense for me.UPDATE AUG-2010:  Check your local Toyota dealership for this filter cartridge.  My local dealership's price was the lowest anywhere at $5. 
Use this for my K&N Air Filter for my Nissan Titan.  Got a few more horse out because of the K&N.  Oil filters good too. I can not beleive how GREAT this tool is. It makes oil changes a JOY, clean and easy. I have been changing oil in my cars for 35 years. I have lots of memories of laying on my back with oil running down my arm, or spilling oil out a pan or dropping the drain plug into a pan full of oil..... NO LONGER..... I am sure I am getting 99% of the oil out by going down dip stick hole.Once all the oil is out it is in spill proof contaner and easy to bring to the local tire/oil change/auto part place to recycle. I really love this tool.On my 2010 VW JSW (Jetta Sportwagen) TDI (Turbo Direct Injection Diesel) the Dealer wants $85 after all the tax and Haz Mat disposal. Although the recommend oil change interval are every 10K; I do it at about 6,500-7,500. Oil and filter are about $50. Money I save I can change oil more often.VW has a belly pan that requires 19 screws be removed.... to access the drain. It takes me 30 min from start to finish to change oil and filter with the Hydro-Turf Oil Extractor. It would be double that going from the bottom and a lot more messy.VW recommends you change the drain plug and crush washer everytime.... another $4 every oil change. The oil filter is on top of the engine in a canister so there is no need to get under the car. Also the oil filter is vertical and sits on top; the base of the oil filter housing has some deep pockets in the base. I used the hydro-turf oil extractor is great at getting every drop of oil out of the oil filter housing, a significant amount, at least 3 to 5 ounces of oil......  Again what little old oil remains is insignificant and with the ability to drain the oil filter housing, not possible with out an extractor, it is as good as drain from the bottom at the pan method in my opinion. Highly recommend. This is a fine replacement for the stock throw away Polaris filters. It comes pre-oiled and ready to use in a sealed bag but you will still need to use you fabric pre-filter sleeve so wash it first and it will fit fine on the K&N.; I use the ZEP comercial industral PURPLE concentrate cleaner found at The Homedepot ($10 for a gallon!) dilute it as recommended on the bottle and place it in a spray bottle for cleaning, this way I can use as much as I want and wash and rinse it until I get it ultra clean without busting the bank. I use the K&N; spray filter oil (below) and spray two ribs at a time from 4 or so inches away, anymore and you've over oiled your filter and its going to be a drippy mess. I let it sit overnight to let the oil set up before a put the prefilter on and put them in the bike.Here is the K&N; oil:K&N; 99-0516 Air Filter Oil - 12.25oz - Aerosol 
I tried Chevron Techron as people recommended here: meaning filled up it twice and also filled out my engine with Tufoil Engine Treatment and my mpg didn't improve at all.I drive 09 Accord EX-L V6 and constantly getting around 20mpg on 91/93 octane fuel driving from Brooklyn to Long Island on Belt  & Cross Island Parkways. Mileage is horrible because there is never a steady speed and often traffics, but even when there is no traffic - still horrible 20mpg. I do write this review after 3 full tanks that were filled after 2 Chevron Techrons. I bought it on Amazon, verified buyer. It is true that sometimes it takes times for oil to lubricate your engine: it could be weak oil pump or restricted flow. It fits my Lexus LS400. After I change oil with this new filter, I hear the ticking sound on the engine head; it could be the filter restrict oil flow and cause the oil not to flow easily. I poped this in after I had already seafoamed my fuel tank to empty and my oil. This had increased my MPG by 1-2 not bad! 
very good Very good.... work great for my John Deere X500 
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars 
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. Great Fit Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. 
For my ATV I purchased the K & N air filter. My old foam type needed to be replaced. After using the K & N filter (which works better - both performance and cleaner) I needed to wash and re oil the filter. Since it's a K & N I wanted to use the K & N "recharge kit" which is designed for this filter. It was fast to clean and re oil unlike my foam type which took 2 days to dry out completely. I do live in the desert, but it only took about 3 hours to completely dry then I could re oil the K & N air filter. Note that if you do use the K & N air filters, be careful not to over oil them. I know some of my friends have had problems with the fuel injected systems that the mass air flow sensor fails if oil get on them. I don't have this problem because my ATV's engine is carbureted. I have carefully checked to make sure this air filter does keep the air clean, and found that it does. It's easy to see when you need to clean them. Just look to see if the red oil is changing to brown. I clean mine every 2 trips which I put almost 50 miles per trip in the dirt (which does get very dusty). Should you get a K & N Air Filter, buy this kit too. This is a fine replacement for the stock throw away Polaris filters. It comes pre-oiled and ready to use in a sealed bag but you will still need to use you fabric pre-filter sleeve so wash it first and it will fit fine on the K&N.; I use the ZEP comercial industral PURPLE concentrate cleaner found at The Homedepot ($10 for a gallon!) dilute it as recommended on the bottle and place it in a spray bottle for cleaning, this way I can use as much as I want and wash and rinse it until I get it ultra clean without busting the bank.

I let it sit overnight to let the oil set up before a put the prefilter on and put them in the bike.Here is the K&N; oil:K&N; 99-0516 Air Filter Oil - 12.25oz - Aerosol I love K&N filters.  I use them in all my cars. As soon as I buy a car I replace the filter with a K&N. Just buy a cleaner kit and clean as needed. Never will need replacing. Do not over oil the filter once you clean it and let it dry before reinstalling filter. If you over oil the filter, the oil can get into intake manifold and build up dirt. 
I do high mileage intervals using 100% synthetic oil in my car.  I always use this on the last tankful of gas before an oil change.  It's amazing how much gunk winds up in the oil after running this stuff through the system.  It definitely loosens carbon deposits as the oil turns pitch black after a tankful of this gas and a 20 oz bottle of Techron.  The oil after a full change remains pretty clear for quite a while so I'm pretty confident pairing this with an oil change is beneficial. The mechanic at the dealer commented on how clean my engine was when they did a TSB job on it compared to another car from the same year with similar mileage. Used this before & it cleans good. You don't need to over do it with the oil. Make sure the filter is completely dried before applying. I love K&N filters.  I use them in all my cars. As soon as I buy a car I replace the filter with a K&N. Just buy a cleaner kit and clean as needed. Never will need replacing. Do not over oil the filter once you clean it and let it dry before reinstalling filter. If you over oil the filter, the oil can get into intake manifold and build up dirt. 
Don't waste your money on Fram filters. Mann filters will not fail you if you plan on a long oil interval in excess of 5k miles.Fit my E39 528i perfectly. It also came with the correct o-ring to seal the oil filter housing. Just buy it already! Toyota offers two OEM air filter: standard and high-quality.  I'd place the Fram filter somewhere in between those.  If you're not up to removing your glove compartment; you might want to have the dealer install an OEM filter.  On Toyota's, it's fairly simple to replace the cabin filter and it only takes a few minutes.  This filter reduces the airflow so the fan has to work harder than it did with the standard OEM filter.  This is the first cabin filter replacement in 7 years and my old filter wasn't that dirty.  I don't drive on dirt roads so I don't need to change cabin air filters that often. paid $3.17 here ....... cheaper than "wally world". I bought three as these work on my motorcycles. filters the dirt, protect my engine.the "classic" purolator filter is way better than a fram (more pleats of filter media) IMO.I'm using these on a Kawasaki EX 500 Ninja but the L14610 will fit any Kawasaki or Honda motorcycle that uses a cartridge oil filter and has enough room , these are approx. 3.25 inches in length .....Or you can use the L14612 which is shorter (2.5 inches in length).why give your hard earned money for the oem filters which are made as cheaply as the motorcycle manufacturer can buy them and branded with their logo.....crappy filters is what you get from the dealer..... I want my stuff to last, LOL. 
I welded a piece of flat stock on the insert for the motorhome. This adapter is for my Dodge Grand Caravan. My old vent cap on my camper had broken to pieces in a large hail storm and this replacement fit perfectly and was a snap to install. I purchased this to be able to attach a high-end hydraulic assisted bike rake on the back of my Jeeps (JKs) with the rear tire still on.  It fit perfectly and teamed with the Bolt Lock BLT7018448 5/8'' Receiver Lock (Keyed specifically for your line of vehicle) it can be kept in the Jeep and my daughter doesn't need anything but her car key.The extender is exactly as advertised, well made, fit perfectly and does eactly what it is inteded for. 
After owning this set  for 3 years i really appreciate the quality for the price. This set can be used to pull pins, bushings, bearings, hubs dents, and more. Minus the special threaded adapters, the set comes complete with hub attachments, 2 or 3 jaw pullers, threaded screw adapter, and more. This is a comprehensive set that the novice or the professional can be proud of owning,i know i am!!!!!! bought to change  coil springs on  a camaro they  arived very well  packaged  i would  say  any one  looking for  a set  to  buy  this set you  wont  be  sorry First set was deficit and was able to return for replacement no question ask. Replacement set is came is a few days. Now the test of my skill to get them on the RV. 
The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around! Very quick and easy mounting and really adds to the look of the rear of the Jeep.  These are metal and not a cheap plastic and mount with included screws into the existing lens cover screw holes. Needed to replace a broken mirror.  This one fit right onto the existing metal holder that was still cemented to the windshield.  It has a lock-screw to hold it in place.  If you need to replace the metal holder, it is included but no glue is supplied.  Overall, it is a perfectly fine basic mirror. 
I mounted this as an auxiliary transmission cooler in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 with the 4.0.  No issues.  Obviously, this was a custom installation.  But with a little research on the jeep forums, no problem. Bought this to install with an aftermarket Kenwood Navigation 7120 on my 08 Toyota Tacoma.  It took several hours to install, but it works great with the wheel controls in my Toyota. Exact fit for Lexus RX300. As easy to install as I could've expected with all parts: the sensor, the cable and  the plug matching the original layout. 
Perfect fit for rear window on my 2004 Ford Excursion Limited. Easy to install. No spotting seen or squeaking at all Even though Amazon says it does not fit my truck; it does fit my 2002 Chevrolet 2500HD crew cab with 6.0L gas engine. I replaced both sensors and harness. Both sensors were rough looking and the rear sensor had standing water on it. It was a little bit of a chore to get to them because you have to remove the intake but it was not too bad. They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. 
I am installing these on a 02 chevy avalanche 1500 5.3L v8. they are a exact replacement of oem. AC Delco all the way... good stuff. I bought 6 of these for my 2005 BMW 325i sedan.Although they don't have BMW parts numbers/logos, I believe these are almost the same as OEM marked spark plug.Installed and works fine. My vehicle: 2004 Honda (Acura) TL 6-SPD J32A VTEC.The originals were made in the USA but these are made in Japan by NGK, or Nippon Touki (Japan Porcelain).  Iridium-tipped plugs are generally used on reciprocating powerplant-equipped airplanes.  Incidentally, Iridium/Platinum plugs are generally pre-gapped at factory and do not need re-gapping (some exceptions apply).  If re-gapped incorrectly, the tip would be damaged. 
Installed on a 2006 Acura MDX and it was painless... worst part of the install was getting out the interior panel holders as I did not have the proper tool. I installed this as an addition to a Python 991 system.  The sensor was simple to install and the color-coded wires and instructions were clear.  For the price, this is a lot of additional protection for the money. I installed this brake controller in a 1955 GMC pickup truck that I use for towing. Just follow the diagram for wiring and it just works like a breeze. I like the way you can adjust easily the voltage with the dial on the left and the mounts provided allows you to install it a convenient location under the dash (it works in any position).If you want to install this in a more modern truck without tapping directly into the wires, you will need additional adapters at extra cost. 
The wire used to make these test leads was not test lead wire; It is much stiffer. When attaching the leads to small circuit boards, you may need to support the leads so they do not tip the board on an angle. Very small cars only. SUV or truck or large car tires do not fit well between the ridges and deform the product. I fastened the mat down with 4 tapcon concrete screws, each 2 inches long, into my garage slab. The leading edge of the mat tore off the screws and folded up. The adhesive strip behind the mat was also useless. I would have had better result with a 2 x 4 piece of fir or pine and concrete screwing it to the garage slab. You also have to aim the car perfectly when you park it because the mat is only as wide as the tire. I can't return it because it's damaged from use due to faulty design. Wasted my money. Sizes listed in reviews and the two in the description (15.8 x 10.5 x 5, and 12.5 x 9.5 x 7) don't match to what I received...The bag I received is in between what has been listed in the descriptions:  13.5" x 9" x 6" (empty).While seemingly a good quality bag, with a fair amount of straps and attached rain-cover (hidden in the heel of the bag), it seems the manufacturer (or seller) has no idea how to use a measuring tape!The bag itself is quite nice... good padding, rubberized bottom to prevent sliding, small pockets on either side, and zippers seem of reasonable quality.For the price and bag quality, I'm not complaining.  It works great on my CB750, and it does fit on the pillion of my VT1100c2 (without having to remove my rider backrest)  So if you have standard seating (or a touring/adventure style), this bag will do well for you as a pillion bag, and with a little strap adjustments, it also fits vertical on the front or back of a sissy-bar, or horizontal on a larger luggage rack...

I have two battery tenders plus a solar battery tender panel. All are quality items, and do their jobs well. I needed this item for an air compressor that draws 15A, and my 12V socket can only handle 10A.  This item is perfect, and small enough to fit in my air compressor's case.  It would be nice if we know how many amps it could handle, but the wire gauge provided is more than enough for my 15A need. The battery croaked after 5 years. I just bought the same thing again.It will probably last longer if you follow the instructions. It's apparently a lead-acid battery and should always be recharged before it gets too low, which I did not do.According to the manual, the battery has enough juice to completely inflate 8 car tires or run an 8 watt TV for 14 hours. Max output is 15 amps @ 12 volts.Shop around. An orange logo home improvement place sells these for a good price.PROs:The CC2300 is perfect for tires.The built-in pressure gauge and clip-on inflation hose make tire inflation a breeze.You're going to waste money on gas unless maintaining your tire pressure is real fast and easy. This unit makes it real fast and easy.It's compact. It has little compartments for all the accessories (charger, hose, 12 volt cord, extra fuse, etc.)The switches and indicator lights are clear, sensible and ergonomic. The handle, and everything about it is to like.The cigarette lighter socket lets you use it as a 12 volt power supply, and also lets you recharge the unit from your car's cigarette lighter. (I never used these features.)CONs:It has very low air volume for air mattresses or large beach toys. I wish they had doubled the air volume and maxed the pressure at 115 PSI instead of 230 PSI.The pressure gauge reads about 4 lbs too high. Need to compensate.It's "household quality" not industrial quality. One of the little compartment covers broke the first day I had it.Strangely, you are not supposed to use it while plugged in to 110 volt AC. 
Nope did not keep out the bad guys as they tore it apart.  The steel coil, sold elsewhere, that is inserted into the filler tube does work and is cheap to boot. This is a well built wheel chock. It's made out of thick plastic. I accidentally ran it over with my car. And it held up perfectly! This is an awesome tool, helped figure out if my alternator was going out. Really cheap and good. Almost, pulled my alternator out, but this machine helped to nail down the issue. 
Hi All.There is not a whole lot you can say about a "Plastic Bag Holder"  It does do as it says it does, and that is a place to stroe your Plastic Bags in your RV.  Its neat and orderly to use.  Only real issues, is look at the size of your RV's Cabinet Doors and measure before you do buy this Plastic Bag Holder.  It is made very well for what it is.  Its a very Heavy Duty Plastic made holder.  I was a little surprized at the size of it.  I too, should have measured.  But it did work out for us, as we have faily large Cabint Doors in our Motorhome.  You could also mount it inside of a Cabinet or on a Closet Wall, out of the way also.  And it does hold a fair amount of Plastic bags, for later use.  Happy Travels. Although it looks to be made with a thick sturdy plastic shell, mine came misaligned. I had to unscrew it and reset the 2 halves together. Functionally, everything seems to work but time will only tell how it will hold up. Also the company logo peels off pretty easily. Pros - As described, heavy duty, well madeCons - Have not used it yetLooks heavy duty and easy to use.  Have not had to use it yet so can not say how durable it will be.It is one of those safe guards for my Harley Sportster, now if I have a flat I can fix it. 
These work well for a budget level. They have double sided tape on the back and a couple of drill holes for security. The problem is that if you only use the tape they can move simply by grabbing them and wiggling them around. The onyl way to truly secure them is to drill holes. I did not want to drill holes in my RV in the event that I didn't like these or wanted to go with something else in the future.If you do get them I would buy a couple packs of them so that if they break or go bad you can put a new one in without chancing them being unavilable and potentially having to get something else that doesn't have the same screw hole pattern. I love Lynx products, these caps fit properly and do what they are supposed to do. I would buy again. I'm sure this product will do what it needs to do.  It's difficult for this product to really screw up what it's intended purpose is.  I use it to put on spark plugs and wheel lug nuts so they don't seize up and become impossible to remove. 
These things are awesome.  I bought two along with some relays and relay sockets so I could get them enough power directly from the battery to do serious audible damage.  Make sure to buy this one with its mate, the 72112 low tone.  After wiring in the relays, these went in my 2000 Civic perfectly.  They replaced the crappy horn in there, and I used the wiring to tie into the relay signal hot wire.  Then, I grounded the relay to the body by tying it into the ground wire from one of the horns.  The horns come with these little wire slide connectors that you can clamp onto your wires.  I used wire nuts to tie all the wires together - I suggest you do the same.  I was able to mount them facing away from eachother with grounding connectors in between the mounts using a single bolt that held the old Honda horn.  This was ideal, and very clean - no drilling required!I suggest finding yourself a 12V DC 4-pin or 5-pin 40 Amp SPST ISO Micro Relay for this project.  Also, it really helps to have a 5-Pin Wire Harness Relay Socket.  This will give you all the wires you need directly from the relay.  These are really cheap items, and you shouldn't have trouble finding them.  The 4-pin relays work fine with the 5-pin sockets.  Then, educate yourself on how relays work, and wire that bad boy up!  I got my relay and relay socket on ebay.Overall, I'm very pleased with this product.  Buy it now if you want to be heard on the highway. These things are awesome.

First I must say I hate purchasing tools that only do one thing...(uni-tasker).  I purchased this socket tool, becouse I had to.  Not becase I wanted to, but quickly found out I need another socket to turn it... and here's the kicker.  The socket is bigger then standard set 19mm or 3/4!  So you have go out and purchase a 15/16 or 24mm socket, which is a huge socket.  I will never use this socket unless I own a diesel truck.  Add that to the cost of the wrench. So about 8 dollars for the socket and the price of tool, just to get started.  The oil filter wasn't on too tight, so the cheaper plastic tool worked out just fine for me.  The 24mm socket stays on the aluminum tool and should ship like that.  Waste of time and money for a tool that only does one task.... 
I used these NGK to replace Champion spark plugs and overall a much better spark plug. The Champion plugs looked very poorly made with an electrode that looked like it was cut with a cheap cutter while the NGK looked very good. The NGK spark plugs look very high quality and are reasonably priced considering they are Iridium. I have used NGK spark plugs in everything from race engines to marine engines to lawnmowers and have never had a problem. While you may pay more than a cheaply made spark plug, you will get better starting, better performance and much longer spark plug life. This item has very strong tools and not likely to snap off in your tire. The plugs are the brown sticky ones which I always found to be superior to the black rubber ones and cement. These are what is factory on many imports. My 2002 crv had a spec for these. They are great and long lasting plugs. They do need to be gap checked but mine were all perfect at .040. The plugs are great but be sure to put anti seize on the threads, The factory plugs called for replacement at 110K, and they were hard to get out because they were a bit corroded in the head. They came out and got replaced mpg went up slightly. hope this review helps.

To my complete surprise, this was not only cheaper than the &#34;automotive store&#34; ones, and less than 1/4 what Toyota charges, it actually appears to be identical to the ultra-expensive OEM filter with lots of pleats. Pretty impressive for the price. Purolator PureOne filters are one of the highest regarded filters. This particular filter is no exception! It's been very versatile (used it on late model Honda Civic, Fit, CR-V, and Pilot as well as on my Goldwing) and filters just as good, if not better, than OEM filters. Highly recommended! 
connected two of these cables to charge my battery on my truck / battery charger unit is in garage works perfect. Purchased this plug to replace the oild stock one. Found that my ATV loves this spark plug. Easier starting and little more power too. Also found that this is a great price on Amazon. What can be said. RV store in town 3 times the price, Amazon online for the same product is a blast at 1/3 the price. Switches work well, wire solder joints are good and the bulbs were all included. Did the job well, mounted perfectly in a 12 volt powered outdoor shop building and a RV ( I bought a bunch), Soon to buy more. 
I am installing these on a 02 chevy avalanche 1500 5.3L v8. they are a exact replacement of oem. AC Delco all the way... good stuff. Just a spark plug, fits my Chinese scooter engine (I have a TaoTao ATM50 A1), but there are many brands using this same Honda clone engine.Has a small center pin, and the right gapping from the factory.Supposedly lasts a long time, can't say as I use it as a backup plug. This fits not only the Ecotec, but newer VW TDI's with the canister filter.  Works great, relatively low profile and goes nicely on a 3/8&#34; drive.  I accidentally ordered three (fat fingered the cart), and sold one to a fellow VW driver and one to a guy with a GM. 
Exact same filter they sell at walmart or an auto parts store.  Save the money and buy online isntead of paying more dollars for local purchase. you can buy this for the same price at the store, but with amazon i had it shipped to the comfort of my own office. That aside this fixed my maf sensor and the trouble codes it was producing. I recommend this over paying in store prices at your local auto shop.  Used this one with previous oil changes.  Stock up and save. 
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. 
Perfect fit on my 2012 Jeep Wrangler, have been a K&N fan for years and have them on all of my vehicles. Great product!!! It works but the actuator in my 14 year old truck is worn. Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!! 
Perfect fit for rear window on my 2004 Ford Excursion Limited. Easy to install. No spotting seen or squeaking at all They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Even though Amazon says it does not fit my truck; it does fit my 2002 Chevrolet 2500HD crew cab with 6.0L gas engine. I replaced both sensors and harness. Both sensors were rough looking and the rear sensor had standing water on it. It was a little bit of a chore to get to them because you have to remove the intake but it was not too bad.

They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. This makes it SO easy to charge in conjunction with my battery tender.  So far it has fit all my vehicles batteries ( Acura integra, Toyota Tundra, Toyota Pickup ) Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. 
Looks and fits the same for a 2000 Toyota Sienna van. I ordered extra so I will not be without any at a later date. Though Amazon stated this cap would not fit my 2013 Ford E-450 chassis (for a Jayco, Class C, Greyhawk, RV), I ordered it anyway as it fits many other years of Ford trucks and looks the same. It is rare for the same vehcle to change a design like that. It, in fact, fits perfectly. Our RV gas filler has no cover (not that that is a deterrant) and 60 gallons is a target for remote theft of gas, or a target for vandalism. This cap fits well. I have not been able to fit the stock cap-retainer onto it yet. I understand these modern vehicles have anti siphon plugs but one can still end up with foreign substances in the exposed fill-tube. This is a good 'ounce of prevention'.Highly recommended. Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!!

Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. Great Fit Exact replacement from OEM. Exact fit worked perfect . Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs. 
It fits fine on my 2012 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab.  I bought this and the stabilizer bar to keep my cooler(s) from trashing my truck bed.So EZ even a cavemen can use it!Ok, he might have a few cuts while trying!! I haven't put this cover through difficult duty, and probably won't...it will stay in the carport most of the time. However, construction is good, the small vents on either side are pretty nice.Regarding fitment, the XL fits a BMW F800ST (with stock rear luggage rack) perfectly. This bike is about 90&#34; long, maybe a few inches longer with the rack. ...fits my 1973 Chevy/GMC 4x4 steering wheel perfect. Stretch it over the wheel and wrap the vinyl string around it nice and tight. The vinyl will break so just stretch it a little. 
Fit my '98 Nissan Frontier's oil pan perfectly. Looks to be of nice quality.  Torque to 25ft/lbs (on the Frontier anyway) It fits fine on my 2012 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab.  I bought this and the stabilizer bar to keep my cooler(s) from trashing my truck bed.So EZ even a cavemen can use it!Ok, he might have a few cuts while trying!! Fits perfectly for my 2003 Toyota Camry, but the number of folds in the filter were fewer than the OEM one. It's short 10 folds compared to the Toyota OEM cabin air filter.

The 2 x 2 Inch mirrors are a good fit for 2006 Honda Pilot. I had to order via Amazon since I couldn't find these anywhere - it appears local auto stores only carry the 3 x 3 inch size. These little blind spot mirrors are a must buy item - they cover the blind spots on either side of the vehicle very well. Sizes listed in reviews and the two in the description (15.8 x 10.5 x 5, and 12.5 x 9.5 x 7) don't match to what I received...The bag I received is in between what has been listed in the descriptions:  13.5" x 9" x 6" (empty).While seemingly a good quality bag, with a fair amount of straps and attached rain-cover (hidden in the heel of the bag), it seems the manufacturer (or seller) has no idea how to use a measuring tape!The bag itself is quite nice... good padding, rubberized bottom to prevent sliding, small pockets on either side, and zippers seem of reasonable quality.For the price and bag quality, I'm not complaining.  It works great on my CB750, and it does fit on the pillion of my VT1100c2 (without having to remove my rider backrest)  So if you have standard seating (or a touring/adventure style), this bag will do well for you as a pillion bag, and with a little strap adjustments, it also fits vertical on the front or back of a sissy-bar, or horizontal on a larger luggage rack... The Tender Jr. does not come with a cigarette adapter so I cut this in half to make two. I purchased 2 lighter plugs for a buck each from China&#8230; with free shipping&#8230; and they are working fine. These aren&#8217;t an exact match with the Tender cables but they fit together OK and are easy to determine polarity with the wire colors. You can also just use this as an extension cord for your Tender. The description states a length of 12-inches&#8230; but it&#8217;s actually 14-inches tip-to-tip on the connectors. Nice item for the price and it&#8217;s made in Mexico. 
This rotor seems OK, but the original is held in place by a screw that is under a plastic dust cover.  So, how do I remove the rotor? I've owned Jeep Wranglers for seven years now. I switched from a traditional cleaner-wax product because Jeep Wranglers have black plastic hard-tops (well, during the winter at least!), black plastic fender flares, black plastic mirror housings, and on the newer Wranglers, black plastic bumpers and door handles and assorted other trim. A traditional wax applied to any of those turns them white, but if you don't treat them with something, they fade to an ugly mottled gray over time. Thus the Turtle Wax Ice, which can be applied to everything -- hard top, fender flares, bumpers, and the Jeep itself. This allows me to make my whole Jeep shine without worrying about getting some white residue on things that aren't supposed to have white residue.Note that this cannot be used on glass, it just streaks. So to make your glass  and mirrors nice and shiny and keep them from fogging up easily in the winter, you'll still need a traditional wax, not a polymer-based product (note - do not apply to exterior front or back glass, just to interior glass and to the side windows!). The same is true for plastic windows on Jeep soft tops, a traditional wax will keep them from turning yellow and help keep them scratch-free, a polymer product like this will just make them streaky. And if you're looking at a deteriorated finish or one with baked in bugs and tar, use some other product first to recondition your finish, don't use this on a badly oxidized or bug-and-tar-spattered paint job. So this product (and other similar polymer products) is not a solution for all protective purposes, but it sure does work well where it does work. This product is pricy, but not as much as others that don't fit the bill as well.  Cruiser Accessories 76100 Tuf-Shield Clear Flat License Plate Cover is just that and a good product to use to simply and effectively cover your vehicle's plate with a protective clear plastic cover, while so many other immediately darken from exposure to the sun's rays, this one seems to stay clear. 
This reminds me of cheap Harbor Freight stocked items.It would work in a pinch to top off the air pressure of a small, compact car...It is not able to air up a full size tire from empty.  It will air up a spare.It is user-unfriendly to uncoil the cigarette lighter plug.The light is useful in a pinch, but awfully cumbersome to access (it has to be plugged in).  Since there are no batteries, so it has to remain plugged into the car cigarette lighter to work.  It was mediocre in brightness.The hazard / red light has to be plugged in, too, so it isn't really feasible to use as a light to warn other traffic.This would be much better as far as the light aspect if it had a battery.It is noisy and dances on the ground as it is working.  (Kind of like a dancing jumping bean.)You can get better, I'm sure...keep shopping... No, I wouldn't use this to power a generator from 12' from my vehicle so my kids could play XBox...but it works perfectly well in my application. I run a 12V air compressor mounted in my truck with this from a standard 12V socket in my Mustang. It has never let me down, blown a fuse, or caused any weird power spikes/drops. It serves its purpose well! The Duracell DPP-600HD Powerpack does serve several uses - some of which it performs above all expectations. However, it is important to remember that it is essentially a giant battery and NOT a generator.One of my complaints is that the unit has a built in monitoring device that provides feedback on the amount of remaining power in the battery. Unfortunately, that feature did not work on mine. I am not sure if my unit is defective... but the display console is essentially useless.PROS-- Will power a cordless phone, modem and router for about 8 hours. We have our phone service through the internet - so when our power is out we lose everything.- It can charge your car battery... in a pinch. I haven't tried it yet, but I am sure that if your car battery wasn't all the way dead the Duracell Powerpack could get you going!- Nice built in flash light and radio. Not of huge use - but in the dark they are nice to have.- Surge protector on the unit - things that pull too much juice will not even come on (like my wife's hair dryer)Cons-- VERY HEAVY - I haven't weighed it but the Duracell Powerpack probably tips the scale at about 25-30lbs. Any many cases it would be too heavy for a women or the elderly.- It is severely limited in the number of amps that you can pull. Again, my wife's hair dryer pulled to many amos - and therefore - would not come on. This severely restricts its use during a power outage. As a rule of thumb only low powered appliances can be plugged in.At the end of the day - for the cost - you could throw in a little more money and buy a generator. While the Duracell Powerpack is silent and does not produces any dangerous fumes it is limited in what you can operate. My recommendation - nice to have in an emergency - but it is not a cure-all if you happen to be out of power. 4 stars. 
I got a power plug to power plug style &#34;jumper&#34; device for my daughter, in case the 12V battery on her Prius dies.  Since the Prius doesn't use the 12V battery to start the motor, she doesn't need real jumper cables.  However, it's a keyless ignition, so she will not be able to jump power plug to power plug.  The battery on the Prius is has small terminals, so these are a nice size and should do the job of getting power from someone else's light to her battery. Another reviewer mentioned this charger puts out 15.0V in AGM mode and that's too many volts for some AGM batteries and it caused his to outgas (reducing the battery's life).  My Optima yellow top AGM battery is rated for 15V charging so I thought this charger would be okay for it, but the charger I got puts out 15.5V!  I did find specs that say 15.6V "regulated voltage" is okay for "rapid charging" on my battery but they don't define what rapid charging means.  They do say with 15.6V to "charge until current drops below 1 amp" which I think means you can do 15.6V until the battery gets closer to being charged and stops accepting high amperage.  Unfortunately this charger does the exact opposite, starting at lower voltage and increasing to 15.5V around when it decides the battery is at 90% charge (which seems to equate to about 12.6 or 12.7V on my battery).  The charger keeps outputting 15.5V until the battery is fully charged, which may take hours, so it seems unlikely that's good for most batteries and I'm pretty sure it's against the charging specs on my battery.  Note that the charger shows 15.4V on its readout but my volt meter shows it's actually 15.5V.Nevertheless I let it keep doing 15.5V and checked periodically to make sure the battery wasn't hot (it never even felt warm and an IR temperature gun read 86F max) and wasn't hissing (hissing would mean it was overcharged and releasing gas, permanently reducing its life).  It took almost exactly 12 hours for the charger to decide it was 100% charged and go into maintenance mode, but when it did, it picked 12.4V!  AGM batteries are supposed to be charged at around 13.6V for maintenance (float) charging, so I have no idea why it picked 12.4V.  I left it on for another hour and it actually reduced the voltage to 12.3, at which point I took it off the charger.  Volt meter said the battery was at 12.31V.I can't decide if this charger is broken, has a weird charging algorithm, or is actually very smart.  I say that because my battery was discharged to about 3.5V a few weeks ago, well below the voltage it's designed to be discharged to (it's a "deep cycle" but even deep cycles don't tolerate discharging below 50%, and even below 10.5V may hurt them), so it's now damaged and won't hold the full 13.6V it's supposed to.  Instead, if I leave it on the charger at 15.5V for an hour, it hits 12.8V and then quickly loses charge to 12.5V in about 30 minutes.  So maybe the charger somehow figured that out and decided that 12.4V was "full charge" on my damaged battery so that's what it used as its float charge.  I don't see how it could determine that if the battery was 12.8V or higher after the long 15.5V charge, but who knows.I also don't know if 15.4V is really bad for my battery, or for the "average AGM".  I spent awhile researching but couldn't find any real authoritative information, just a bunch of people theorizing.  Since it's above the 15V standard charge on the battery spec sheet I don't think it's a good thing, but then again I also found research (nrel dot gov/vehiclesandfuels/energystorage/pdfs/evs17pres.pdf) showing that seriously overvolting a yellow top battery to 17V under certain conditions actually increases its life.  So I don't know what to think, but I'm leaning towards thinking it's a bad thing to go against the manufacturer's spec sheet unless you're in a lab using specialized chargers.What I do know is that the desulfination feature on this charger didn't do a thing for my damaged battery.  In fact I don't think it even kicked in.  I connected the charger to a small sealed lead acid battery that I left unused for too long and it went into desulfination mode (I think - the manual doesn't say how you're supposed to know) for over 8 hours pumping 16.8V into the battery until it said "bad bat" on its screen and stopped charging.  In all that time the battery never showed over 15% charged on the charger, though it did end up holding about 10.9V.  In my online research it was mentioned in a few places that there are no studies showing desulfination actually works so I'm pretty dubious about it.  It definitely didn't work on either of my batteries.It was also interesting to note that the sealed lead acid battery never got warm, which I find rather curious considering how long it was putting in such a high voltage.  I had the charger connected to a kill-a-watt meter and it showed the charger was pulling only 0.15amps and 9watts, and this is in 2amp charging mode, so maybe the charger is smart enough to use low amperage when it's using high voltage and that prevents the battery from getting damaged.  When it was pushing 15.4V to my AGM battery it was only drawing 0.35amps and it actually reduced the amps to 0.29 as it got closer to 100% charged.  So maybe that protects the battery from overvoltage damage, but I don't know enough to be sure.  Maybe a battery expert will chime in in the comments.Another important thing to consider is that desulfination mode could damage your car's electronics if you don't remove the battery from the car to charge it.  16.8V is more than most cars were designed to handle, and I found someone mentioning that BMW warns not to use chargers that do things like that, so it's definitely a concern.  I don't know if I feel comfortable using this charger again without removing the battery from the car.  Some chargers claim to somehow magically detect the presence of car electronics and limit their voltage, but this charger says nothing about that in its manual.Other than all that, the design of the charger is nice.  Wires fit into a pocket beneath the retractable handle.  It will show you the battery voltage on its readout until you tell it to start charging (although it reads 0.1 to 0.2V lower than my volt meter, which is annoying).  A button lets you toggle between display of voltage or battery percent.  It lets you choose standard, AGM, and gel cell, and choose from three rates of charge.  The slower 2A charge rate is supposed to be better for many batteries, so use 2A or 6A if you aren't in a hurry.  I tried both those modes and it still puts out 15.5V in 6A mode but it puts out 15.3V in 2A mode.Since this is a dedicated 12V charger you don't have to worry about it "autodetecting" (actually, auto-misdetecting) your discharged 12V battery as a 6V and never charging it past 6V, which is a problem with far too many chargers these days.Despite its nice controls and smart form factor, I give this charger a low rating because I think it tries to push some batteries beyond their limits in the name of charging them as quickly or as fully as possible.  One reviewer said it caused his AGM to outgas and another said it burnt out his battery after a few months of trickle charge mode.  If you have the right brand of battery that can handle this charger's output, and your battery isn't damaged, it's probably fine, but the fact that it can damage things and may even damage car electronics in desulfination mode strikes me as very bad design, especially given that desulfination seems like more of a marketing ploy than a valuable feature.  I also don't like that its volt meter reads 0.1 to 0.2V under actual voltage. This is a useful device to have in your car but you must understand it's limitations. In many cars, it will not be as accurate as taking a reading directly off your battery, which you can do with this device, if you buy this inexpensive additional adapter:Roadpro 12V Battery Clip-On and Cigarette Lighter AdapterThe reason for this is that in vehicles where you have to turn on the ignition to ACC in order to power the cigarette lighter port, once you do that, the vehicle's electronics are also powered and will draw power. So, you will see a lower reading on this device than if you take a reading directly from the battery with the key out of the ignition. In vehicles where the lighter port is always powered, this device can be more accurately used directly plugged in to that port.However, for taking a reading of your charging circuit with the engine running, this can be used in the lighter port in any vehicle.Note that you can do all of this with any household multimeter however the chances of you having that in the vehicle are slim. Most all multimeters also require a battery in them so even if you store one of those in your vehicle, the chances are high that when you need to use it, the internal battery will be dead.This Equus unit however requires no internal battery (at least I don't think it has one), so you can just throw it in your glovebox indefinitely.Car batteries typically last around 5 years so after about 3.5 years is when you may want to periodically use this device to check the health of your battery. Basically, anything under 12v after the vehicle has been sitting for at least 4 hours is a sign the battery should likely be replaced. Above 12v and the battery is probably fine as long as the vehicle starts up.When a friend or relative asks me to check their battery, the first question I ask them is "Does your cigarette lighter port work all the time, or just when you put the key in the ignition and turn on the car?". If they say it's always on, I know I can pretty adequately test their battery just through the lighter port. If however they say it only turns on when they put their car to ACC, I know I will have to have them open their hood so I can read the battery directly with the Equus.The other good thing about this is that you could leave it plugged in all the time for a constant monitoring of your electrical system voltage while driving and parked.For the price, this device is nice to have if you understand how to use it.If you want a more robust battery tester that can not only give you the voltage, but also the CCA rating (cold cranking amps), I recommend this:SOLAR BA7 100-1200 CCA Electronic Battery and System Tester 
Headline says it all.  I use it to pump up a water well pressure tank from a 12 v battery using a small portable air compressor. Just like fire needs oxygen, heat, and fuel, cars become roadblocks withoug gas, battery, and air.  You can carry more gas, and a second battery / electrical system, but air is hard to find, and with "service" stations removing it from their offerings of yesteryear, you need to have your own air system.What impressed me most about this compressor was the attachment point to the valvestem.  It is threaded and screws on, forming a seal during refil.  This seal is exceptional - good enough that the guage mounted on the compressor itself is accurate to set your tire pressure at the other end of the hose.  If you are filling a big tire, it will take some time, so this lets you sit back and relax while the motor works.  My tire chucks for shop air all require constant finger pressure to ensure a seal - not having to get tire chuck thumb was a nice side benefit!As for portable inflation systems, I've grown tired of anything with a cigarette lighter plug as the power source.  It's limited to 10 AMPs which gives you roughly 130-140 watts of power.  740 would be a full horsepower.  This compressor under load can draw 30 amps at 13V, for 390 watts - more than a half horsepower.  To do that they use clipon cable back to the battery.  Because I carry a second battery I clip on to it for the juice to run this.  It will also work with your main starting battery if you don't have a backup elecrical source.In the box you will find a carrying bag as well as an octogonal shaped piece of plastic - thats the air input filter - you need to screw it onto the air inlet to protect the compressor.  Its a quality unit so it needs protection.When all is said and done you have a 1/2 hp 12VDC compressor that gives you the freedom to set your tire pressure when and where you want to.  With the fast fill rate it takes very little time to top off your tires, if you want to drop your pressure for sand offroad and then refill it later when you hit asphalt this is a small but valuable tool to have in your emergency kit.The unit has a well balanced carrying handle to take it between tires and is light weight enough to take with you everywhere.  While you can use your car's starting battery, a second battery will prevent you from draining your starting battery.  When done, start up and drive away.If you seriously go offroad consider a highjack lift to get you out of a bind, or else a hydraulic system with a portable cylinder fed from your engine's hydraulic pump (if yours is equipped with one) or a secondary hydraulic system powered by your secondary electrical system - with all this you will not be stuck for long!Finally maintaining your tire pressure at proper levels for your load optimizes your fuel efficiency - at $3+ / gallon for fuel these days your efforts will pay for themselves shortly.While I have a 240VAC compressor in my shop, this is the first honest 12VDC compressor that does not take forever to fill a tire.  With a half horsepower air cooled motor it does the job quite well.  It's worth the money to keep onboard. This little compressor has far exceeded my expectations. I have had two plumbed to an air tank that ran air tools on my rig. They run forever and have never gave me a problem. The only thing I would suggest is to switch out the male hose adaptor. This will allow you to run a regular sized higher quality hose that can attach to regular air tools/hoses in a pinch. The one that comes with it is an odd ball size. Don't get me wrong...you can't run air tools directly from this compressor. But using two into a tank makes it possible. I would buy another one in a heart beat. A little noisy but what compressor isn't?! It pushed a decent amount of air for the money. You need one for your vehicle so just buy it. 
I have one permanently connected on my mini-motorhome.  It works great while connected to AC power AND the engine is running.  Whenever I'm hooked up to AC power, the battery is maintained when powered up and not damaged when the engine is running.  I'd surely call this a must have for RV's. Bought this in May 2012.I usually carry jumper cables in my car, but not anymore. Jumper cables: you should get a set longer than your vehicle, so you don't have to back it out of a parking spot first. Then with the longer cables, you should get the heaviest gauge wire you can or you lose power through the cables. Then of course you'll need someone with a car or truck to help you!!Solution: Booster PacI really like this battery pack compared to others.1) no unnecessary gadgets like a flashlight, air compressor or 110V AC inverter. While these are handy to have they usually are of poor quality when combined in a package like this.2) Size is great and easier to carry. While all these jumper battery packs are heavy, this one is relatively narrow in width making it easier to carry at your side with arm extended.3) Takes up little room in your trunk and can be locked up with a bicycle cable lock.4) Can be charged by your auto's 12V adapter. You have to monitor the battery's green "Charge complete" LED  because there is no automatic shutoff when the charged through the 12V outlet. This means you can overcharge it and reduce it's life and capacity.5) Use it as a power source to recharge your phone or iPad etc.Maintenance notes:Be careful using this as a power supply. The BATTERY is designed to deliver peak power to start your car. It is not designed to deliver continuous power like a car battery or battery back up.For longest battery life recharge as soon as possible after each use and at least once a month.Avoid discharging it to 50% or less as this will eventually decrease power output. Recharge as soon as possible after each use to extend it's useful lifeCons:Only 1: I don't like the AC charger. The brick gets hot and stays hot even when the charge is complete. Must be an old style transformer electric vampire.CHARGING OPTION:I recently bought a modern battery charger/maintainer for the car to top off my car battery and maintain the charge when the car sits. These chargers are not expensive for the lower current models.(about $20 on up)Schumacher SEM-1562A 1.5 Amp Speed Charge MaintainerModern chargers are designed to gently charge your battery especially from 80% to full. This charge method will extend the life of your battery and give you maximum amps when you need it. When your battery is full, they go into a Float/monitor mode.I used my new battery charger on this Booster Pac and had great results. I tested the battery Pac with a professional 100Amp battery and alternator tester. The Booster Pac tested  well within the good range which was better than charge with the supplied AC adapter.NOTE: you can use a motorcycle/car battery charger through the Booster Pac jump cables or 12V accessory plug. Both work.Fortunately I have not needed to jump a car since I bought this unit in May 2012.Would definitely buy this again.Took off 1 star for the AC charger that gets hot during and stays hot after the battery is charged. It is a potential fire hazard and wastes energy. With so many vehicles, I needed to replace my 25 year old unit.  This uses dual power, so at home I can plug into AC; on the road the 12 volt plug in my car.  I like the auto shut off feature when pressure achieved. 
I have one on my motorcycle, and purchased this one to tend my trailer batteries through the winter. I went onto the Battery tender web site to find out how to hook up batteries in parallel so I can charge the 2 Marine deep cycle batteries that power my trailer. It is working great and looking at the diagrams I will be able to hook up my 2 spare trailer batteries in parallel for a total of 4 deep cycle batteries. connected two of these cables to charge my battery on my truck / battery charger unit is in garage works perfect. This is the best thing for keeping your battery up when being stored.Once your batery is up to a full charge, it practicaly uses no power. It only kicks on when the voltage falls below a usable charge. It has a plug in adapter that you can fasten on to the battery permanately and just plug it into the charger when needed. 
I have a 2013 SUV which has problems maintaining a battery charge for more than a few days. Lexus supplied a non-waterproof, but more powerful Battery Tender. Problem is that I park the vehicle outside, so I bought this model. It charges and maintains the battery, but to reach full charge takes about 1 1/2 times longer than the one with the Lexus label. By the way, the Lexus model is just a re-labeled Battery Tender, as is the re-labeled BMW model I also have. I've bought two of these through Amazon and I may buy another.  I use them on my lawn tractor and standby generator battery for winter maintenance, and on one of our cars that doesn't get driven very often.  At the price, they are cheaper than some of the smaller encapsulated trickle chargers.  They have worked great for me on batteries from lead-acid automotive types to gel cells.  If you're looking for a battery maintainer with a little more power to charge, this is the one.  Remember, today's vehicles with clocks, navigation systems, and other electronics may draw more than a small trickle charger can provide.  This charger at 1.5A can provide enough power to compensate for electronics that draw extra power even while off. There are no better battery charger/maintainers than Battery Tenders and these wires are essential if you have multiple motorcycles like I do. Just attach it to the battery terminals and plug it into your Battery Tender when you need to. 
The quality of the Bleeder is awesome, however it will take hours upon hours if you plan on actually using this product to bleed your car's brake fluid. You are far better off either using a buddy to pump the brakes and you open the bleeder valve and then press the brakes in 5-10 times, and then closing the bleeder valve and repeat as necessary. You get a higher amount of fluid out each time than using this bleeder. After squeezing the top on it managed to keep 14 PSI (14.5 Recommended for by VW mechanics manual), which literally pushed out 10 drops every minute.If you aren't too sure how to bleed brakes as I stated above, just go on youtube and you'll see what I am talking about.Also the bleeder bottle you can find on amazon as an item frequently bought with this item is worth the money. I almost bought aquapel because people were saying things like Rain-X only works for a few days, and you have to reapply it often. I've had it on my car for a month so far and I'd say it's 90% as good as the day I applied it. There's only a few small spots where it doesn't perfectly bead up, however it took about 2 minutes to reapply it this morning. I literally did it while my toast was in the toaster.Get a microfiber mitt and a full towel. Spray 3-5 sprays on the palm of the mitt and wipe it in a circular motion, overlapping a few times in each area. Once you go over your whole windshield, go over it with the big towel, I found if you use a mitt to try to wipe it off, it builds up on the mitt and just starts smearing instead of removing excess. It's a bit harder to wipe away ONLY on the first time. The first application may take 15 minutes so make sure you have time, but if you reapply it every month or two, it takes just a minute or two like I said earlier. You also learn the most efficient way to wipe it so you become faster every time you apply it. You could probably get down to 1 minute, and only then not lower because it needs to dry a little bit.ACTUAL EXPERIENCE: Now that you know how to get it on the right way, here's the actual review. It does exactly what it says and you barely need to use your windshield wipers at all unless it's a very fine mist or downpour. Bought this for changing transmission fluid since I like to throw a few fresh quarts in more frequently than changing the oil (when I have to have truck jacked up to get at the filter.).It was simple to put together with the instructions provided. All the parts seem to be good quality, though only time will tell if this is in fact true. I like the fact that the storage container is metal and not plastic - gives it a much nicer and durable feel and I'm not worried about cracks or leaks developing.Having never changed the fluid in this truck by dropping the pan, I can't comment on it's speed vs the plug drain method, but it was sufficiently quick for my purposes. I simply started the vacuum and went off to do other things while I waited - approx 10-15min to empty 3.5 qts. I only had to pump the device once after the initial vacuum creation (NOTE: don't do 40 like you did the first time or you could damage your unit - it's 15 MAX with liquid inside).Definitely satisfied with the device for my use and if I had a top-accessible oil filter I would probably use this device for changing my oil as well - its way easier and cleaner than crawling under the vehicle and making sure the drain pan is in the proper position to catch everything. 
Rated the best &#34;value&#34; filter on the market by independent testers that tested each filter on the market by using them and then cutting the filters open to see how they held up under actual use.  They then rated the filters on how well they fared and also how well they were made. These filters work very well in eliminating some of the strange tastes from certan water sources.  It's difficult to judge how long to use it before replacing it, but it does work.  The Flexible Hose Protector is a piece of junk - it doesn't last that long and is difficult to use. This fits my 2004 Lexus RX330 perfectly. IMHO I feel that thisplain paper is superior to "carbon" type filters. How long can athin sprinkling of "carbon" last? Plus you can easily see howdirty the filter actually is and replace accordingly.  A good value. 
Used this on a 2005 Camry. This filter is exactly the same as factory. The triple layering filter technology is only found here. This is the only replacement filter I recommend. And at 10 bucks off dealer price. It can't be beat. You can pay outrageous prices for OEM filters, so I use OEM for the warranty period, then change over to Fram. Fram is a good filter at a value price. I buy all my car filters on Amazon and pay my mechanic only for labor. I ordered this to remove the filter housing on my 2011 Prius.  It is a solid and quality socket. You will not regret buying this Oil Filter Socket. I am very satisfied with it. 
I have it hooked up to the SUV.  This actually works and will kick on every other day or so just to top off the battery.  It does get VERY warm when recharging a low battery so be careful where yo set it down...8-2013 UPDATE. The button to change the type vehicle its attached to starting NOT to work, no matter how hard you pushed on the button. It was returned directly to CTEK and replaced without incident (of course I had to pick up shipping to them).. Closes screen back and locks it into jam, its great when door is attached to screen minimizes the outside door fromm flying open as well if you add more tension to spring buy pulling in longer then screwing it. Now Instructions very minimal. It shows you on faded small diagram how it works and how to do it kind of. But I would say, it would make sense to tell you to install spring as close to inner door jam as possible. After I looked at it for some time it made sense. Maybe I just like instructions that are so clear grandma can do it without thinking if shes doing it right. But needless to say I would say this is a great idea for any RV door. I don't know why I did not get this sooner but it works very well in filling the fresh water tank in my fifth wheel trailer.. the shut off valve is nice to have at the nozzle so I can easily shut it off the moment I hear that it is full.. 
The results are amazing.  Quiet, quiet, quiet and less cycling.  Hard to believe that these tiny things make a difference but they really do. Easy to install. Don't have to gap. Noticeable performance improvement. My old plugs had 60K miles and were pretty worn. I required an ammonia-free window cleaner for my tinted windows. This does the job quite nicely. It isn't how well it does, rather how safely it does it. 
This filter drops right in and has carbon in the filter for filtration.  I looked up how to replace this filter online however the directions included show exactly how to replace it since it is behind the glove box.  It will only take about ten minutes.  Don't let the dealer charge you $35 for this job! I use this in my 2005 Lincoln Town Car Signature Limited.Always use Motorcraft in a Ford/Lincoln/Mercury vehicle.This will last a long time, but you don't necessarily need toreplace it every year.  Fuel filters are best replaced after a certainmileage, not necessarily time.  If it's a few years old, replace itanyway.  But if not that old, replace after 30,000 miles sincelast replaced.  If neurotic about replacement or don't knowdate of last replacement, replace right away or after somelesser interval like 20,000 miles.  But if you believe thefilter might be in serious need, do replace it at once.This is a sturdy, solid unit but does not include a clip; canbuy that separately or your installer can locate it without a lotof fuss. Washed the filter on a Friday evening and the filter was dry Saturday evening.  Sprayed on the oil on Sunday afternoon.  Very easy to do on a 2008 GMC Sierra 3500 HD Diesel.  My main concern with the dealer doing it was that they might not have let the filter dry completely before re-oiling it.  How would I have ever known if it were done correctly?  They said it would take about an hour.  I don't know how the filter could have ever dried &#34;naturally&#34; as is required by K&N, in only one hour.  I'm glad I did it myself and I bet you will be too.  This kit will probably last for at least three recharges. 
I have bought this filter before. I highly recommend it to all bikers to buy when they need to replace their filters, it make the removal and install so much easier to work with due to the nut attached permanently to the bottom of filter. besides, its a higher performance over the oem filter. buy it you would love it too. Replacing air filters are so easy to do that even a neanderthal could do it. Why pay them big bucks? Been using K&N filters and this service kit for years.  Best way to save money on air filters.  Buy this as soon as you get your car and you will never need another filter again. 
This tail bag easily attaches to the motor cycle. 4 straps with a loop on one end and a quick connect on the other.  Also there is one strap with quick connects on each end and all are adjustable length. good bag for the price. Easy to replace. It lacks Toyota instructions, but it is exactly like existing Toyota part with all wires colored the same way so it is very obvious how to connect those.The original part has a silicone rubber tube going all the way from top to bottom with wires running inside it. This part only provides a short length of tubing that, at best, would cover half of the length of wires on my car.I thing they should provide a &#34;telescoping&#34; tubing of two diameters with one going inside of the other while you are crimping wires and then extended to cover the full length of wires There are two horns, not one. One is 400Hz and the other one is 500Hz.PIAA | Automotive Sports Horn (400/500Hz) #85110The are exact fits on the mounts as the OEM horns and use the same bolts. A 1/4 inch drive ratchet and a 12mm socket is needed to remove and install the bolt. They came with grounding leads with ring spade lugs that mounted readily under the existing M6 bolts on the radiator supports. All you need is a 10mm socket.The two wiring harness leads are too short to connect the horns. Two wire tie mounts hold the harness to the aluminum bumper reinforcement. You can cut off the ties and use the OEM harness to connect the horns, but I chose not to.  I prefer NOT to cut off the OEM connector blocks.I made two pigtail extensions out of 18 gauge black primary wire, 5 inches long. One end needs a 1/4 inch wide exposed male quick disconnect. The other end needs an insulated female 1/4 inch quick disconnect terminal. Since I used 18 gauge wire, I used the red coded ones.The exposed male connector slides into the OEM horn connector perfectly. The female one clips easily onto the positive terminal of each horn.The horns how have a weather shield on the apertures.Best thing to my surprise is that they appear to be very high quality and Made in Japan.Also nice is that they need no modification to the horn relay or circuit. 
They only fit around a standard thickness roll bar not the newer jeep arrangement with the plastic cover shroud of the late models. Like others I have found the cover to fall short in the sizing department. I understand it's leather and unlike a comparable vinyl based product, sizing is critical because unlike vinyl, leather can't be stretched too much for a fit. This limits you to a steering wheel that is within 5mm of the product's diameter. I have tried fitting this on two steering wheels. First on my F250 and it was literally impossible. The diameter of the cover missed it by inches. Then I tried fitting this on my Saturn Vue. Now this is important, because the Vue is geared towards women whom have small hands, ergo the steering wheel is smaller and skinnier. So you would think the Vue is a perfect candidate...NOPE. I wrestled with the installation and would described it like sparring with a bear. After 10mins (not including breaks) I finally got the thing on the Vue. The result was the leather had stretched so much, it literally developed permanent stretch marks. Also, like other's who have commented in their Feedback, the wrap only made it barely halfway around the grip of the wheel. So there are now two pressure points on my hands from the front and back seams of the wrap when gripping the wheel.I gave it a rating of three due to it's exceptional quality. It is well made in the sense that its leather is very thick and the seams are well stitched. If this was right-size for my application it would have rated it Five.Part of the poor fit was my fault since I didn't pay close enough attention to the specs and prior to ordering I should have measured my steering wheels for proper fit. I mistakenly assumed since I had two steering wheels and one that is especially skinny, that It wouldn't have been a problem fitting.Take proper care with the dimensions of 15 x 1.5  Measure the girth of your steering wheel with a seamstress measuring tape. If 1.5" does not cover at least 70% of you steering wheel circumference and the wheel's diameter is great than 15 inches, you will be immensely disappointed or at the very least frustrated with the install. Easy to replace. It lacks Toyota instructions, but it is exactly like existing Toyota part with all wires colored the same way so it is very obvious how to connect those.The original part has a silicone rubber tube going all the way from top to bottom with wires running inside it.

I can't believe how difficult it is to find tie-downs that have locking hooks.  There are NONE out there except for these.  They're heavy duty and meet the need perfectly I probably should compare it to another to see how accurate it is, but I really like how easy it is to use and turns off and on by itself. This product works well. However as some others have said a bolt to hold the thing on the jack isn't really needed and is rather cumbersome to remove and install. A quick pin would have been better. DO YOU HEAR THAT HI-LIFT? 
Everything about these jack stands speaks to quality.  These jacks stands are very well made of heavy gauge aluminum with a hardened steel pin with a bearing lock for the height adjustment.  Some light assembly with a flat head screw driver is required before use.  There's a screw (provided) that threads into the bottom of the base to fasten the stand support (red) and base together.  Another reviewer stated that his stand 'wobbled'. While it's possible that reviewers stand was defective, if the screw is threaded into the hole and tightened down firmly into the base, the stand won't wobble. On my SUV vehicle, the jack points are very close together, so the base of a tripod-style jack stand is too wide for use.  The narrow profile of these stands is perfect and allows me to slip the jack stand behind the jack and under the rear jack point. Once in position, remove the pin, adjust the height and reinsert the pin. I also don't care for the ratchet style jack stands, which have been known to fail.  There are lots of low priced jack stands on the market, but when it comes to safety (yours), spend a few extra dollars are get a pair of these pin-thru aluminum jack stands by Torin.  They work extremely well and they look cool too. Easy to install. I used my own screws because of the material that I was mounting the bracket on. I had to tape one of the light adapter plugs as it was a loose fit in the bracket. Hitch extender is good for Kayak transport and allows me to secure slippery kayaks to bed, with minimal effort. There are rings on Tee, allow straps and Bunge Cords to effortlessly secure boats to bed.  After securing Kayaks in place with Rope and cords, this method of support and tiedown of ends of Kayaks just makes sense.  Good product, Well made and painted with good coating for corrosion resistance.  Stores easily or hangs from hooks on Garage wall, though it is somewhat weighty.  Yo lil' mamma will struggle to move it, but that's why you have one! Also mounts to support cab level or bed rack level loads like ladders. The ladies will like it's slender frame. You yakkers with hitches, should get you one! 
Made in China poor quality item that does not befit the Robert Bosch brand at all.Not for winter for sure.The origin of the product should be stated at the product page.If I knew it were a MADE-IN-CHINA I would not have bought it. Considering this is made in China, it is a quality product, too bad all my locks are keyed to the some number Great quality.  American made. 
INNOVA 3030 Diagnostic Code Reader for OBDII Vehiclesi purchased this product last month and i don't know why. it reads your on-board computer alright. but if you want a detail report of a problem you might be having with your check engine light on, they charge you a fee for a complete detail report.AUTOZONE,ADVANCEAUTO AND CARQUEST will test your vehicle free of charge and will provide you with a detail report for free.the fleecing of america continues by online companies.AMAZON, SHAME OF YOU !!!!!!!! I've an Optima in my old Corvette that has now failed.  I've have read thru their warranty information.  It states that the battery must be returned to the selling dealer for warranty service.  It cannot be returned to Amazon for any reason.  Therefore my question is this:If the battery purchased thru amazon should require warranty service, how is this done and by whom? This is a standard replacement for your air filter in your vehicle.  In my case, it was for my Jeep Liberty. 
ARB base plate, nice thick plastic, works great.  Essential part of your kit if you carry a Hi-Lift on your truck. Great wheel lock that is easy to activate and unlock.  It comes with 3 keys, one of which has a LED light on it.  The product also comes with a reminder cord that attaches to the handle bar as a reminder.  It does just what I was looking for. Well built with a weatherproof cover; comes with two keys and will protect your hitch or what ever you need to protect. 
Recently purchased an USB Oscilloscope for use in my projects.  This set of test leads is worth it's cost from Amazon. I do recommend this kit. great price, quick delivery - AWESOME customer Service from Camco - I ordered 2 kits, and one kit had one piece in the kit that needed to be replaced, and Camco replaced the entire kit for me. highly recommended bought to change  coil springs on  a camaro they  arived very well  packaged  i would  say  any one  looking for  a set  to  buy  this set you  wont  be  sorry 
It does what it is supposed to do, that is to increase placement distance from the car to the electrical outlet These item does fit perfect on my 2004 BMW x3. does what its suppose to do. so far so good thanks It does what it is supposed to and suds up. 
Installed this for my wife's Jeep. I recommend tightening bolts into receiver threads (and then removing them) prior to actual installation to ensure they thread easily when performing the actual install. This one installed much more easily than the one for the Town & Country. perfect for my camper hook up.  It was fairly easy to install and not only has the circular connector, but has the 4 pinconnector also I should have gotten the Honda cap.  This fits OK, but the screws are not "captured" in the cap.  With the original cap,the screws cannot fall out.  Considering the position of the screws when mounting this, captured screws are an advantage.

Heavy rubber, good gauge coated snap connectors; comes with variety of components necessary to test different configurations of sparkplug on vehicles/equipment.Has extended accessory to test recessed plugs, such as those on a Ford Triton engine (coil on plug setup).This test set will indicate YES/NO as to 'fire' - not a measurement of current.In sum, if I'm experiencing a miss at idle or under load, and static ohm's are good, and this tester indicates all plugs receiving fire, there is high probability a weak coil exists.  I then pull/reinsert plug wires one at-a-time while engine is running/stumbling to pinpoint faulty plug/wire/coil - (o'skool way).Kyle I installed this brake controller in a 1955 GMC pickup truck that I use for towing. Just follow the diagram for wiring and it just works like a breeze. I like the way you can adjust easily the voltage with the dial on the left and the mounts provided allows you to install it a convenient location under the dash (it works in any position).If you want to install this in a more modern truck without tapping directly into the wires, you will need additional adapters at extra cost. 
Does what it says it does......looks great ! These item does fit perfect on my 2004 BMW x3. does what its suppose to do. so far so good thanks Does what it is designed to do and Amazon has great prices on them. But, if you are replacing yours on a ford f-250 with 5.4 go with 15718 with the longer cord. And a 2003 f250 w/5.4L only has 2 not 4 like it shows. 
I guess I'm a bit jaded .. I'm always surprised when something actually does what it's supposed to.. It works well if you have half a brain unlike some other reviews that I have read of people that can't get it to work.. Either they are a little gumpy or the laws of physics cease to exist in the particular location they happen to be in... It works well for a few days and after that I have to dump my tank and deposit more Bio-Paks. I just don't know, I may be doing something wrong. But, I don't think so because I am following the directions on the package. If any one has some tips please post them.................... Ordered this to put on top of my floor jack which was 3" diameter but it did not fit, it was just sitting on top loosely.  So I'm giving it 3 stars, if it fits your application, I'd imagine it would be rated highly.  So it's back to either a puck or wood for me.Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you, it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews, and leave a comment if you have any questions, I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help. 
I took a flier on this after reading the reviews. I lost. The meter is easily 5-9 volts off (tested with my multimeter and confirmed with my volt meter app on my power supply).Don't waste your money. Amazon should seriously consider dropping this item from its website. A number of reviewers have commented that the accuracy of this gauge is 0.1 psi.  It isn't.  The accuracy spec is +- 0.5 psi +- 1% of the reading.  This means that the gauge could show anything between 34.1 to 35.9 for a tire actually filled to 35 psi.Long story short...don't believe that 1/10 digit number that's being displayed.  If there's a slight change in tire pressure, it'll show it, but the actual value can vary significantly from what's shown. This is an excellent cigarette lighter battery meter, works perfectly.  Helped me diagnose a bad alternator in my Escalade and I got the dealer to see it when I brought it in and they just replaced it with no questions asked, that was a $500 alternator.And to the other reviewer who said its not as accurate as a Fluke meter, nonsense.  I have a Fluke meter and put it side by side and it was accurate to the Fluke meter to 0.01 volts.  If anything this Equus can refresh alot faster then my Fluke can. 
Sprayed some very toxic paint. I did not smell anything. When I took the mask off you could see every thing caught in the filters.This mask is designed so you can make an air tight fix with little or no effort. Once you put it on it stays and does not slip or move. 'Really protects your health. A must for using some spray paints even from a can Please read the labels. Some of this stuff is really dangerous. Armor-All is a miracle worker for tired, dried, old upholstery. It cleans, seals, protects, covers scratches, and makes leather and vinyl look new again. I've been using it since the early 1980s, and highly recommend it.  I use it on the seats, dash, inner doors, and even on the tire sidewalls.  I've also used it on leather and vinyl purses, an office chair, and leather book covers.Just spray, let it soak in, then wipe it off well.  If you buff it, it doesn't leave an oily residue or any odor.  Don't use it on any place that would be a slipping hazard, like floors, because it does leave a slippery finish.Try Armor-All and you'll be amazed at how great your car seats can look! I use this on My New 2013 KIA RIO and it pulls the Dirt off the Car after I thoroughly wash it. An Amazing product, works like a charm. The spray has a Cinnamon smell to it, its not bad but For people who don't like Cinnamon I feel sorry for you,k But I would use this None the Less.It pulls the contaminates off the car and yes you can hear it, it does help remove tar, bugs can be stubborn but do come off. Make sure you use plenty of spray and don't push hard, you need to glide across the paint. 
My rare 1970 Chevy is about to get upgraded headlights. Have not installed them yet so I can't say I love them yet. From what I've seen, these DOT approved, glass lens, metal bodied units, with heavy dust covers, will not be noticeable to a novice eye. Look at the photos on the desription page, there were no surprises for me. "Cool Nova."HELLA 002395301 Vision Plus 165mm High/Low Beam 12V Halogen Conversion Headlamp (HB2)x 2. I installed these to replace my stock, yellowish, non-impressive Toyota FJ Cruiser headlamps.  You can see the difference in a pic I posted, the drivers side is the PIAA and the passenger side is the stock lamp.  The PIAA is visually whiter without the blue look.  I have not spent a lot of time with them on dark country roads yet but the initial feeling is that they should be an excellent upgrade.  I will post up once I have a few miles on them in the dead of dark!Update July 2013.  I love these lights and they are still going strong.  Excellent white light for dark, dark country road driving.  FJ should have come with white lights like this from the factory, they are a great match!Update October 2013....they are still working GREAT! I did not carefully read reviews before placed my order.  Few buyer pointed out the product feature has changed.  According ad photo, It suppose has green and red indicator lights but only comes with one single red light, green light feature is omitted.  Red light means AC power is on but no way to tell it is actually charging or not?  For only one red light version, you can pay less than half price from other seller for similar product at Amazon. 
This is the best stuff on earth when you need to do a repair and cannot do a proper weld. It will also stick to most anything including plastics. It is strong and can be sanded, drilled, tapped, and machined once it is set up. A must for any shop or do-it-yourselfer. When it comes to safe transportation, I try to take every preventive measures no matter how unlikely I will ever need it. First aid kits, flashlights, safety triangle, fire extinguisher, light reflecting outfit and finally this one, these make make up my doomsday inventory so far. Among them this may look to be the most extreme item but believe me people do get trapped in the car and unfortunately lose their lives just because they can not free themselves in time.I am afraid I don't have hands on experience about how this device works and I would never want such an experience, but just by writing the name resqme on youtube you will instantly see over 20 videos about that device. There you will see that it can really cut through the seat belt with one blow and somehow pulverize the window glass within seconds... So when you need it, if you can keep calm, it may take less than 30 second to get yourself out of the vehicle which would otherwise take minutes or not be possible at all.Due to great reviews and demonstrative videos, I purchased this item. I paid around $10 for a single one but sometimes there are bundles on amazon and you can buy a dual pack for $15.Although it is designed as key chain which is how you can keep it accessible on an operating car (provided that you don't have one of those new keyless devices) but like many other reviewers, I did not put it on my keychain. Although it is as small as it can be, still takes up some space in your keychain and feels bulky. Besides, since it has a built in blade, it may be misunderstood as a knife and put you some headache in airports and places like that. So, to me the best place to carry it is in the glovebox in a tiny case. But make sure that at no circumstance, it moves from where you put it and that you can access it easily from where you are trapped. This solution may not be ideal for some people and/or cars but then I advise you to look for a place that you can use for the purpose.I wholeheartedly recommend this product for anyone who values their life and wants to raise the safety level of their car trips and wish that you will never ever need to use it... It works great, easy to program. Love all the features. Has a nice bright screen, flashlight just incase. plus it can be programed to remember how much air your tires need. 
Can never go wrong with slime stuff.Don't put too much in a tire or you will be able to feel it moving around when you ride...a dirt bike...for instance. Perfect for washing the RV...strong pole you can scrub as high as you need to go or can leverage. Holds its position when set.  Very pleased. This gauge works perfectly, always giving a correct reading and fits on the back tire of my Yamaha XJ650 no problem which is hard there isn't much room between the valve stem and the break drum.  Its small size allows me to carry it in my riding jacket pocket so I can check the pressure of my tires anywhere!  You can't go wrong with this gauge. 
Seems to be a good product but does not remove all the odors associated with the water. It wasn't advertised to take out all the odor,just greatly reduce them.  We had some odors from water in a local campground. No taste issues so I think that was o.k and the odor wasn't all that bad but don't think it will take out all odors competely. cleans very well removes brake dust and stuck on grime..need to spray on and let soak scrub with brush..hose off..if stains are old or been on rims for awhile you will have to do a second clean but it will remove 95% of grime This must be one of the best washer fluids for summer, Do Not use this in the wintertime, will freeze up and may crack the tank, cleans the windshield of all the bugs and sap perfectly 
Worked wonders on old, old dried in dirty grease. I wanted this to try to clean a rug I have that I haven't been able to use for years. It is a super thick, tightly woven 100% wool rug with a great kitchen design of fruits and veggies in full color on a black back ground. Well.....9 years ago I spilled an entire vat of hot dirty deep fat frying grease on it and it completely soaked through. I also got very sick about that time and didn't get around to trying to clean if for at least 90 days and the grease had dried into it. I tried saturating it with other cleaners and Tide ans Wisk laundry detergents hoping it would get the grease out but it didn't. I didn't have the heart to throw it out so I held onto it all this time and I'm glad I did. That little throw rug cost $190 and I sprayed enough of this KRUD on it so it soaked through out the rug, let it sit for a few hours and all I did then was scrub it lighlty with a toilet bowl brush and it got all the grease loosened up and then I rinsed it out in the tub. It took a few days for it to dry because it is that thick but now I have it back in the kitchen and am loving having it back...... I then tried to remove old dried in yellow oil stain that had come from my washing machine when I washed too heavy of a load so the oil came from the machine and got into my favorite powder blue sweat shirt, and again, I tried Tide, Wisk and other cleaners and they didn't get any of it out, I sprayed KRUD on the spots, let it soak in and left it for an hour, then rinsed it out and the stain was gone....I'm thrilled. Between the rug and the sweatshirt this KRUD has saved me $230. They should call it "GOLD" not KRUD. I'm going to buy it by the gallon so I always have it on hand. You should too. I've been using one of these for years and I'm on my second one. This duster works exceptionally well and lifts the dust without dragging it around. I will NOT make a filthy car that hasn't been washed in weeks or months look clean. You must either keep your car in a garage, or use a cover like I do, and dust it daily to keep it looking clean. If I wash, clay bar, and wax my car I can go two months or perhaps more without washing it again, as long as I keep it covered, dust daily, and wipe it down weekly with an instant detailer. The fibers are impregnated with a paraffin wax so don't just lay it on something if you don't want it to be stained because of the wax and dirt. Also, if there is condensation on the car it really renders the duster ineffective so make sure it's dry before using it. Best wash mitt around! I have used cheap wash mitts and foam pads before, they shed, get hard, they get heavy from the water, etc. This mitt doesn't scratch the car but pulls off crud and bugs off the car easily (make sure you rinse often). I have used mine about 20x already and it is still preforming as described.I strongly suggest this item for all. 
I use Lexol leather conditioner on the leather seats in the car and leather furniture. Makes the leather very soft and pliable. The Zymol Leather Cleaner does an EXCELLENT job of:-CLEANING: The cleaning action is clearly visible: the more vigor you put into working the leather, the more the application of the Zymol Leather Cleaner turns white and sudsy. Follow through the cleaning by wiping off with a clean dry rag and any dirt and grime picked up by the Zymol Leather Cleaner will transfer onto the rag.RESTORING: The end result: the Zymol Leather Cleaner leaves the leather with a polished look as pristine as when the leather was brand new. Mind you, it doesn't accomplish this not by leaving a greasy residue behind like some "cleaners" do. The Zymol Leather Cleaner not only leaves leather feeling clean with NO greasy residue, it restores the softness and suppleness of leather.The cleaning does clearly strip some of the natural oils from the leather. I would strongly advise you to follow through the cleaning with the Zymol Z-509 Leather Conditioner. Both the Z-509 Leather Conditioner and the Zymol Leather Cleaner are available here at Amazon as a package at a very reasonable price.I'm giving the Zymol Leather Cleaner my highest recommendation. Go on, give the Zymol Leather Cleaner a whirl and see for yourself what a FANTASTIC job it does of cleaning your leather! This has to be one of the best leather care products out there. I have used it on my leather coat, car seats and shoes. Does a fantastic job of softening and conditioning the leather. Even protects my leather shoes from salt damage here in the midwest, where sidewalk and street salt can really ruin a pair of leather shoes in no time. Would recommend to anyone. 
I don't need a gallon of this stuff.  I don't need a quart.  I don't even need a pint... so this was the perfect size to have on hand for occaional small engine reassembly and repair. I needed this item for an air compressor that draws 15A, and my 12V socket can only handle 10A.  This item is perfect, and small enough to fit in my air compressor's case.  It would be nice if we know how many amps it could handle, but the wire gauge provided is more than enough for my 15A need. With my new wheels I needed a tire iron to be able to reach how deep my bolts are in the wheel now.  This tool came with everything I needed.  It covers both size deep well sockets and an extension.  The telescopic handle is great for space saving to store in the truck.  It is also nice that it will fit standard sockets and is not just once size socket for the whole tool.I gave it 4 stars because I certainly trust the tool for an emergency but don't think it would make a great tool to use day in and day out.  Hopefully that make sense.  Also the bag that comes with it is thin flimsy plastic.  I didn't even bother with the bag. 
Had my 13 yr old car painted and the  body shop said no waxing for 90 days to let the paint out gas. I live in FL with bug season and water spots from washing and general dirt abound. Called Meguries and this stuff is body shop safe. Which means it will let the new paint out gas. I have been using it with excellent results between washes. Once the 90- days are up I will use a permeate wax.For really tough bug stains I use DP Detailers road kill bug remover and then the final inspection to bring the shine back. On very light bug splats the Final inspection works fine. This stuff works great! I was skeptical. It seamed expensive, but this bottle will last you years.It really works. Wipe one, towel off. No streaks, no dirt. Amazing. This way you can wash your car in your garage in the winter, or to keep out of direct sunlight in the summer. I use this product after i dust off my car (i do it every night because i love the paint job on my car) it cleans bird droppings and bugs from the hood without leaving any streaks.along a soft microfiber cloth this spray will keep your car looking clean 
If you have ever cut a filter open so see how it's made, you need to see these to appreciate the quality. I find they are the best and I am running two &#34;Cobra&#34; engines. I've always been told that Royal Purple products were good, but more expensive than the products I've used in the past. However, Amazon offered a package at a price that was actually cheaper than if I bought it at a local store, plus they shipped it for free. As for the product, since I tend to use quality synthetic oils in my 2008 Honda Civic I guess only time will tell, but I do seem to have more pickup that has a firmer feel. My Honda is slightly modified, but the other day I out ran a BMW that was attempting to cut me off as I merged onto the free way. Was it the oil? I don't know, but as long as I maintain my average of 35 MPG and can merge at that pace I will continue to buy Royal Purple. It should be noted that I also use ZMax at the same time, or when I can afford it. Would I buy this again NO. Here's why . I missed it but no where do they say these are Sheep skin. I may be wrong but suspect this one I got is domestic goat skin. A smaller one I bought I have no doubt is Pig Skin. Since they are made in China this has made me really compare and check them closely, since most Chinese products are inferior quality.  First the package has 4 LARGE STAPLES that go through the skin Every layer) and if you don't open these CAREFULLY you will tear it, since they double back on themselves. Some reviewers report holes developing when used and I can believe that.  Second no where does this company say it is lamb or sheep skin, which leads me to believe it probably is pig or domestic goat skin, or horse hide. Is it going to scratch my new cars paint or hold up long? Good question. I also bought the 2 foot one and have no doubt it's not sheep or lambs skin. I'll review it later and probably will never use it on my car paint since I fear it will scratch the new Clear Coat paint. The 5 foot one is thin enough and buffed fairly well, so its soft.  But I have the ACME Brand made in Turkey also (same sizes) and those have instructions to wash with a mild soap to remove excess cod oil before using, (that's normal) and when you do you will see the excess oil. (I use mild bar hand soap) These Detailer's Choice ones don't tell you that and if you compare them you can see a difference in the amount of oil used when looking at them unwashed. (AS an aside the Chinese made chamois have had import restrictions place on them in Europe due to the inferior quality, deceptive advertising, etc. But not those from Turkey) Both of the Detailer's Choice leather skins are cut nice and rectangular, which shows they come from a large skin. Now I don't often write negative reviews but check what I'm saying by researching on the net . If I had done that first I would never have bought these. Yes I could return them but after deducting the return fee and shipping it isn't worth it. I think of this mistake as a lesson learned and would not recommend these nor buy them again. Other negative reviews are probably right on the mark.ADDENDUM:  After writing this review while showing these to my wife I laid them on a dark bedspread.  MISTAKE; since they left a ton of hide lint behind on it, (had to vacuum). So I washed them with hand soap and water in a sink and couldn't believe the amount of hide lint in the water. Washed them twice then rinsed them three times and was still getting a large amount of hide lint coming off. My wife saw that and said,"No way are you using those on my car."  Haaa So my next step is to hang them out side after drying and use a water hose to try and stop the lint problem. I'm 69 years old and have used both synthetic and natural Chamois for years and have never seen anything to match this. With that much lint coming off no way to wax after use. Another negative reviewer rated them as a POS and believe he has that right. Never would buy again nor recommend to anyone. Hope this helps someone not to make a mistake. 
The soap suds well and keeps it's suds during my entire car wash. It leaves a nice shine and doesn't streak much at all. If you work on dirty/greasy stuff, you need this.Gritty, to get the grunge out of your fingerprints/creases, doesn't smell odd, and it dissolves grease like you would not believe.  One cleaning, and you're likely done, even if your hands could double as pumpkin lube. (automotive reference) This stuff works very well,spray on and watch the dirt, break dust just drip down to the ground.Rinse very well and don't allow it to dry.You'll be amazed and what comes off of your wheels amd tires 
used this stuff to clean my carpet on my 2006 Jeep tj worked great on carpet and upholstery. cleans and brighten seats. mothers is the best. I bought this for quick cleaning of debris, it's perfect. Just spray and use a microfiber towel and your ride is as good as new. It for sure cleans up messes and prevents scratches in the process leaving your surface squeaky clean. Nice long fibers grabs  dirt and grime and does not scratch the surface.  Follow the two bucket method, and you'll see that this mitt traps the dirt deep in the fibers, that rinse well between soapings.I highly recommend Meguiar's Microfiber Wash Mitt.  Buy two, Good mitt, use one on the paint and another on the wheels. 
I purchased these for my husband who washes cars and he said that he needed more so I ordered eurow microfiber premium 16x16 350 gsm 36 pack from amazon just to try something different and he loves the eurow's brand better because they are a lot thicker and made of better quality material and is cheaper than zwipes. While zwipes still gets the job done they are better for using on glass. Where as eurow is better for removing polish or wax off the vehicle. One of the best waxes to get. The same quality as the expensive ones and better than the cheap ones. This is defiantly better than the liquid waxes. Cleans up the car great! I'd use a carnauba wax to put on after to make it more shiny cause it cleans well and lasts long but lacks a bit in shine Nice kit for total beginners or as a gift. The price is much cheaper than buying individually which is great. As for what is included, it is all good quality products as Meguiar's tends to sell. This is really geared to a beginner since someone with more detailing experience or who has done it longer will already have most of this kit, so it would be better to buy other individual products rather than this and ending up with tons of bottles of scratch-X and plast-X which are used much less than say wax and shampoo. 
Once you use this tool you'll know why it is so handy.  It is a must have if you do any hose work in the engine bay.After use I put a dab of WD40 on the area that grabs the hose to maintain it. I always buy a few hoses, two 10 footers and a 15 ft hose. I then connect together the best combination lenth hose that will get from water source to RV. Keeps my camp area neat, plus why on hot days would I want the sun heat the water in the hose and have to wait for the water to get cool by running it. Just makes more sense adding what ya need together then 30 ft of hose sprawel out on your camp site. Most campsites you will end up using the 15 footer anyway. This filter is a must have if you want to have water that is clean and as pure as your home filtered water. I believe that by using this filter the water that we will get from the different campsights will be as close to home aas possible. Easy to use and store a must have for those who are concerned about what they drink. 
This chamois works great. Very absorbent and holds a lot of water. Do not use anything else to wash your car. This is the BEST stuff to use to polish your vehicle. It does not leave a waxy mess when trying to wipe it away after dried.There's really not much else to say. I will never use anything else for my vehicles. For a true showroom shine, get you some Liquid Glass. I use these instead of dish rags, to wipe up small spills, clean the bathroom, dust the furniture and clean windows.  (Not the same one of course).  Then I throw them in the wash and reuse them.  Make sure when you wash or put them in the dryer do not use a softener. 
I've read other reviews where some say that this does not stay in place.  I installed two in my garage, one on each side, for both my vehicles. After marking the optimum spot on my garage floor where I wanted my vehicles to be clearance-wise, I cleaned the floor to remove any/all dirt and grease.  Then, since my floor was pretty cold because it is still winter here in Colorado, I used my creme brulee torch to heat up the concrete so that the tape would bond with the floor better. After placing the parking stop on the floor, I parked my car on top of it over night.  This step might have been overkill, but I wanted to make sure the tape made good contact and bond with the floor.  After over a month of use, both stops are still in place and we are pleased that we can park our vehicles in the same place every time. In summary, take care to find the optimum place to install on your garage floor, prep the floor properly, and this parking stop will work great. The floor liners fit perfectly and trap almost everything my shoes drag into my 2011 Jeep Rubicon 2 door.  I live on a dirt road, so even my leather sole dress shoes seem to drop dirt and gravel into my floor boards.  All I have to do is pull them out, shake them a little bit to remove gravel and dirt, or spray them with water if they get muddy.  I would highly recommend the Husky brand liners.  I think they have a lifetime warranty, too! I live in an apartment with an attached indoor parking lot, so no water hose or anything.Every weekend (as best as I can), I head down there with a bag containing this No Rinse solution, a microfiber sponge, a couple of towels, a Windex spray, a gallon of water in a bottle, and a bucket. 2 caps of the No Rinse and 20 minutes later, my car is clean and shiny. No hassle, no water wasting, no hose needed. 
The product works well but the bottle itself stopped working halfway through my second time using it. I like the Meguiar's products but don't like how you can't just unscrew the cap and pour it in a regular bottle. I like how this fits in my 5-gallon bucket and traps the dirt.  I use a 2-bucket system and this helps clean the microfiber mits, too.  A little pricey, but I don't see replacing it for a LONG time! I just finished using this for the first time today. Lately I'd been using a flexible squeege to begin drying my car then follow up with a chamois.WHAT A DIFFERENCE!! Rarely does one come across an item that works exactly as advertized. This one does! Now I use the chamois for the tires and wheels and the Absorber for the car. Unbelievable how much water that thing can suck up and hold! Try it. You'll love it. 
Figuring the kitchen needs to be most level, we placed it on the kitchen counter. Works well. Handy size for use and storage in a drawer.  ~Pegleg~ Beats holding the hose and it as a shut off.  A must for those who use the fresh water tank. Mitt holds lots of water and both sides can be used as it is a flat style with cuff. 
I use these instead of dish rags, to wipe up small spills, clean the bathroom, dust the furniture and clean windows.  (Not the same one of course).  Then I throw them in the wash and reuse them.  Make sure when you wash or put them in the dryer do not use a softener. Fits right in the sink and is perfect for daring your dishes.  I like it because I can wash my dishes, stack them in here and give them a quick spray, saving water in the meantime! Really great stuff, it can pick up dirt and easily be cleaned in the bucket, really great if you are using a two bucket wash. 
I am looking for quality, but inexpensive, microfiber cloths that I can use to detail the car and clean the house. These fit the bill as I can use these in my daily cleaning.  12 x 16 is a good size for quad-folding.  Still debating in my mind vs. using 16 x 16 cloths.  Need to remove the tags from these before use and may want to wash first to remove manufacturing lint. This mitt gets used in the washing of a fleet of vehicles. So far it has stood up to heavy use and holds water and car wash soap very well. This worked just as described. I would recommend using a couple gallons of water with your mix of Meguiar's for an SUV sized vehicle, especially if you use the recommended wash mitts. It cleaned well and rinsed off easily. 
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. 
It does the trick - easy to use and not only gives the OBD2 code but also the name for the code so you have some idea of the problem before you research it.When I followed the web link through the software for more information, it asked for VIN and License numbers and had some 15+ diagnostic questions.  I was expecting a more complete analysis after going through all that, but found it wanted $9.95 for a more comprehensive report that would include possible causes and troubleshooting info, which you can find on other web sites through search engines.I would have liked the product to include a concise Quick-start guide, and for the users manual to include a list of codes and brief descriptions.  I didn't find the documentation to be user-friendly.If all you want is a tool to read the code, this is the tool for you.  To make the results useful, you'll need to research the code on the internet. Installed this this spring on my first outing and I have not been disapointed.Read the instructions carefully and installation should be a breeze. I Have a 2007 Ford E250 van that I use for work. After the company sold the old truck I had and gave me this one, but with no wireless remote, I went online and did a little research. Amazon had the cheapest price and the seller gave very detailed and accurate instructions with the remote. Read over the directions and take your time and setup should take no longer than 2 minutes. 
I welded a piece of flat stock on the insert for the motorhome. This adapter is for my Dodge Grand Caravan. Exact fit for Lexus RX300. As easy to install as I could've expected with all parts: the sensor, the cable and  the plug matching the original layout. The drop on this hitch is exactly what I needed for my Dodge Ram.  It makes hooking up my trailer a breeze. 
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Even though Amazon says it does not fit my truck; it does fit my 2002 Chevrolet 2500HD crew cab with 6.0L gas engine. I replaced both sensors and harness. Both sensors were rough looking and the rear sensor had standing water on it. It was a little bit of a chore to get to them because you have to remove the intake but it was not too bad. Works great, nice to have a second cable, but the OBD end of the cable is angled.  In my case, this cable won't work on my Subaru Outback.  I would prefer the option of a straight OBD connector.  Note that the angle connector works on my other four cars (Mazda, Honda, Dodge). 
It fits fine on my 2012 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab.  I bought this and the stabilizer bar to keep my cooler(s) from trashing my truck bed.So EZ even a cavemen can use it!Ok, he might have a few cuts while trying!! These are great for my Trailblazer, but huge for my daughter's Camaro. So keep in mind, you may want to go with a smaller ton stand if you don't have a truck or SUV These mirrors fit over the factory mirrors like a glove! They really fit nice, and no vibration. The do an ok job. It depends on the size of the trailer you are towing. They worked well with my 22 foot travel trailer, but now we have a 30 foot travel trailer, and they don't offer as much rear viewing sight. I will have to go to the factory extended mirrors. Which I kinda of expected that. For the money they do well!If you will do a lot of towing, and in busy areas, I would recommend the factory extended mirrors. They cost more, but may be worth the extra, as compared to side swiping someone! I think for as much as they do extend, they could of been a little larger, just my two cents worth. 
My old vent cap on my camper had broken to pieces in a large hail storm and this replacement fit perfectly and was a snap to install. I purchased 2 packages of these coil compressors (so 4 compressors total) a while back knowing i would need them to swap out a set of springs from 1998 Chev Camaro.  I was installing shocks and lowering coils to improve handling and get rid of some body roll.  On the Camaro, the rear is a solid axle so the coils and shocks install separately (its not a coil over shock system as in the front).  While compressing the rear spring, I ran out of room...the threaded bar portion was making contact with the top of the coil's housing so i used the extra 2 compressors i had to compress the coil further until i could remove it...So the compressors did their job easily. its a good product and very well made however, you may need 3-4 of these compressors to help further compress the coils.on the front, the coils and shocks were out of the car so no space issues and two compressors easily compressed the coil...i used 3 to be safe. Used this to replace front coil springs on my JK.....Worked well very heavy built. The safety pins are a must have.

Fit my '98 Nissan Frontier's oil pan perfectly. Looks to be of nice quality.  Torque to 25ft/lbs (on the Frontier anyway) 
Perfect for exhaust work.  I bought it for a catalytic converter and o2 sensor project because it is rated for: -30F to 1800F I put these in my '03 TJ Jeep Wrangler.  They fit perfect and work exactly as you'd expect they should.  I installed a set of 55w HIDs in them and the light output is tremendous. Bought this to use withValterra F02-4100 45 RV Hydroflushso I could wash out my tanks.Here is my review of that setuphttp://www.amazon.com/Valterra-F02-4100-45%C2%B0-RV-Hydroflush/product-reviews/B0002UHVAA/ref=cm_cr_dp_synop?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints;=0&sortBy;=bySubmissionDateDescending#R2CUAU2B8XC98QIt works great.I also like that I have this as an emergency backup if one of my valves ever fails. 
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Perfect fit for rear window on my 2004 Ford Excursion Limited. Easy to install. No spotting seen or squeaking at all Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. 
Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars This works great. It's sturdy and fit's nice and snug in a standard 5 gallon bucket. I will be ordering more of these in the future. I put these in my '03 TJ Jeep Wrangler.  They fit perfect and work exactly as you'd expect they should.  I installed a set of 55w HIDs in them and the light output is tremendous. 
I bought two sets / 4 total. I use them near the middle of the lifting range which puts the saddle about 18 to 19 inches high. This is perfect to get my truck off the ground and give me an inch or so of ground clearance to R&R; the tires and do other work underneath the vehicle.I don't need 6t worth of lift, but I like how these j/s have a wide lifting range. With these set for my range (as stated above), they are not teetering at the top of the range like others I've used in the past, but are comfortably in the middle. They are very stable and solid units.It would be helpful if the info stated the lifting range of the units, not just the tonnage they can support as a pair.Min. Lift Height (in.)14 29/32Max. Lift Height (in.)23 1/2 These caps fit on top of the Tri Lynx levelers (Tri Lynx 00015 (10)  Lynx Leveler) or by themselves, for under stabilizer jacks or the hitch jack (if you have a light trailer).  They can also be used on top of the levelers, for under the tire(s) to level your RV.  I don't know how much weight they can bare, but they do well with my 3,400lb trailer for all of the uses described above. Sizes listed in reviews and the two in the description (15.8 x 10.5 x 5, and 12.5 x 9.5 x 7) don't match to what I received...The bag I received is in between what has been listed in the descriptions:  13.5" x 9" x 6" (empty).While seemingly a good quality bag, with a fair amount of straps and attached rain-cover (hidden in the heel of the bag), it seems the manufacturer (or seller) has no idea how to use a measuring tape!The bag itself is quite nice... good padding, rubberized bottom to prevent sliding, small pockets on either side, and zippers seem of reasonable quality.For the price and bag quality, I'm not complaining.  It works great on my CB750, and it does fit on the pillion of my VT1100c2 (without having to remove my rider backrest)  So if you have standard seating (or a touring/adventure style), this bag will do well for you as a pillion bag, and with a little strap adjustments, it also fits vertical on the front or back of a sissy-bar, or horizontal on a larger luggage rack... 
Sets under the left side frame rail under the drivers door. (2005 Ford F150) ... If you have the proper filter wrench it's a very fast job. Our 2012 Sonic only came with the anemic, cheapo small car sounding one note horn.  I initially bought the low note, thinking it was what the car needed, but that is the note/tone that came on the vehicle stock from GM.  The high note gives it the two tone sound, similar to what is on our larger Yukon SUV.  It does get noticed much more than a single note horn.Note: For those installing this on a Chevy Sonic, Cruze or Aveo, I was able to unbolt the driver's side front fender liner, starting on the forward side, and removed 4 screws up to the top of the wheel well.  Next i had to hold this fender liner back temporarily with a small block of wood and some string in one of the holes tied to the rim.  With an assistant honking the horn, I easily found the stock horn, spliced into the positive horn wire and used an existing small mounting hole, behind and below the existing horn mount location.  The supplied screw and ground wire worked perfectly.  If you use the 'piggyback' style wire splice that taps into an existing wire, be sure to put some clear silicon caulk over the splice ends after crimping, and then wrap some electrical tape around the snap cover to keep the connection dry and tightly secured. This product fits like it should and would look really nice if it had been shipped properly!  I got it and the box was all crunched.  The item had no cushioning around it and the front is bent in.  Need to return for a replacement!  It would have been 5 stars if the front had not been bent in and it was packed properly!  Fits right over my 3 burner RV stove and rest on the counter top.  I will be adding rubber feet so that it will scratch the sides of my stove nor my counter top!  To secure it you have to screw it to the counter top.  The back has a hing with 5 screw holes in it where you can secure it or it will stay put without screwing it down.  It came with 5 long screws.  Not sure if i want to secure mine yet.  I have a new RV and not sure i want to put screw holes in the knife holder behind the stove! 
The 2 x 2 Inch mirrors are a good fit for 2006 Honda Pilot. I had to order via Amazon since I couldn't find these anywhere - it appears local auto stores only carry the 3 x 3 inch size. These little blind spot mirrors are a must buy item - they cover the blind spots on either side of the vehicle very well. Evidently these are meant for use on cars ONLY. They are too small to fit the coil springs on my '11 Silverado. Otherwise I guess they are decent spring compressors. I put these in my '03 TJ Jeep Wrangler.  They fit perfect and work exactly as you'd expect they should.  I installed a set of 55w HIDs in them and the light output is tremendous. 
This device attaches securely to the tow vehicle, but at a cost.They are cumbersome to attach and detach, with several moving parts and the potential to scratch the tow vehicle paint during either process if you don't have three hands available.To attain the secure vibration free fit, you must crank down on the ratcheted web strap hard enough to deform the door where it attaches to the window channel. It also deforms the rubber window seal.Foam pads protect the door somewhat where the bracket would otherwise rub on the body, but if the area isn't meticulously clean beforehand I can see where it would dull the paint over time.Because of the metal claw part that fits into the window channel, raising and lowering the window caused a screeching sound on my driver's side window.Finally, when they are detached from the door, they make for a very bulky awkward device that doesn't store conveniently or compactly in the vehicle.I'm sending them back. i use this lube all around the house....door hinges, oven hinges, key locks, sliding door tracks etc.works nicely and doesnt leave a visual layer....dries invisible Received within 3 days. Saw Mythbusters do a test of these LifeHammers and they worked quite well cutting through the seatbealt and any of the windows EXCEPT the WINDSHIELD. Commit that to memory! In a emergency situation it will not easily crack or break the windshield, side and rear glass only. Mine is getting mounted in clear sight and access from the front seat, right in the middle of the rear seat benches so as to be easily grabbed by all! I have had experience with a stuck seat belt and they are a bitch to cut through with a semi-sharp pockt knife. 
Very quick and easy mounting and really adds to the look of the rear of the Jeep.  These are metal and not a cheap plastic and mount with included screws into the existing lens cover screw holes. Screws are very soft and are easy to strip and not stainless.Plate is flimsy so think thoroughly about how to secure it best Easy to put on, just move it into place and and snap it in.However, it depends on two clips on the bottom that are fairly thin. If you force it instead of maneuvering it into place, those clips with break and it won't stay on. 
My last same-sized container anti-seize, standing at attention, lasting me 30 years (home use), so my children will finish this one.About it:It's silver in color, 8-oz. container (a bunch), -65F - 1600F, Anti-Seize, -Corrosion and -Galling; has Lid Brush; label indicates "Made in USA".Specific Use: Ease assembly and disassembly of hardware which experience extreme temperatures and/or corrosive conditions.I've used this routinely, and sparingly for it does not take much - just a light swipe on threads, mating surfaces etc.  Most of my last container went to lubricating boat and boat engine components for very good saltwater corrosion prevention.A general caution is: not apply to business end of sparkplug, O2 sensor etc (lightly on threads/sealing surface only) - else could impact component performance (never seen it happen lol).*UPDATE: I visited Permatex website - wished I'd done so earlier ...

Construction features include:-  Steel Cases"Ironed" for a precise fit, fluted to ease removal and painted for rust-resistance.-  Pressure Relief ValveWhen it's cold outside or if the filter becomes clogged, oil flow through the filter can be reduced. If this happens, the relief valve opens to provide a continuous oil supply. Its design also minimizes the chance of contaminated oil recirculating back-  Anti-Drain Back ValveThis feature keeps oil in the filter to prevent "dry starts" after your engine has been turned off. It's made with specially formulated material that resists the aging effects that an engine's heat can cause.-  Efficient Filter MediaRe-engineered media increases Motorcraft filters' dirt-collecting capability, allowing them to capture more engine-harming particles than ever before. Heavy rubber, good gauge coated snap connectors; comes with variety of components necessary to test different configurations of sparkplug on vehicles/equipment.Has extended accessory to test recessed plugs, such as those on a Ford Triton engine (coil on plug setup).This test set will indicate YES/NO as to 'fire' - not a measurement of current.In sum, if I'm experiencing a miss at idle or under load, and static ohm's are good, and this tester indicates all plugs receiving fire, there is high probability a weak coil exists.  I then pull/reinsert plug wires one at-a-time while engine is running/stumbling to pinpoint faulty plug/wire/coil - (o'skool way).Kyle 
As the title says, I am satisfied with my purchase.  I like that there is no extra power supply to keep track of and carry around to charge the device.  As far as I am concerned being able to just plug any standard work type extension cord is genius!  The AC power supply works as advertised but the inverter cooling fan is rather noisy.  You can hear it from one room of the house to the other.  The LED light is smart as LEDs use very little energy.  There are consistent complaints about the air compressor taking forever to inflate a tire.  The problem is not in the air compressor but the little black nipple at the end of the house.  One must, with the lever first up, push the inflation fitting all the way onto the tire valve stem by twisting the fitting and gently pushing until  you can see none of the brass fittings and then push down the lever to connect the hose and open the valve on the valve stem.  If you do this correctly, you will see the actual tire pressure currently in the tire on the air pressure gauge.  If the air hose fitting is not on the valve stem properly, when you turn on the inflator, the air pressure will initially say 0 psi until you turn on the pump and then the pressure will jump up to 100psi.  What is happening in this situation, is that the air compressor is trying to push against a closed valve.  It will VERY SLOWLY push air into the tire.  Make sure you have the fitting right and it will work very quickly.  Black and Decker should put a better air hose fitting on the end of the hose to eliminate this issue.As stated, everything works.  Ultimately, I will use the dc receptacles to charge the device via solar panels through a charge controller.Update as of 9/19/2009I have had this unit for some time now and have been charging it via the 12 volt cigarette lighter with a small 30 watt array using two Sunforce 15watt panels in parallel.  I use a Sunforce 7 amp charge controller to protect the battery in the device. I can easily charge this unit in about 6 hours from a depleted point at which the inverter auto shut off to protect the battery the night before.  I get 5 to 6 hours of light from a standard torche lamp in my living room with a 23 watt cfl installed.  I recently started charging it in parallel with a old jump starter pack I had been given as an anniversary gift at a job. If I am only using 6 hours of the sun, I am not storing all the energy I can.I now run the Electromate in the living room for about 5 hours to power the lamp and the Jump start pack gets a 75 watt inverter plugged into it and I run an identical setup upstairs in my computer room.I want backup power in an emergency and a very good way to get the bugs out is to use it continually so the problems will pop up at I time when I don't really need emergency power, instead of at the most inopportune time. I bought this extra one to hook up to my quad's battery permanently and just have the plug in routed cleanly, so all I have to do is hook it up to my battery tender and I'm all set. I have had several of these items . I like to have a inverter with a tire pump . Cost was a big factor for me in my younger days . However I now carry this , and a separate air pump that has battery clamps by viar . I am much happier and simply use my generator or a 12 volt led lamp . I used this during the past winter 4 or 5 times to jump start my van with a 351 and it cranked right up from dead after sitting and the charger coming undone . It barely took a charge this spring after I went to charge it after neglecting to do so all winter using it . This will never let you down . I believe it will last years and I love having one in each vehicle for the safety as well as to help others at church or the store that are less fortunate . A great investment and safety item for any family . Pay the extra you will be very happy if starting cars is your main need . Use a viair air pump and buy a battery clip one attachment into a 12 volt plug which will give you the leangh to go around your vehicle and will fill your tires in less then a minute . Do not use the 12 volt outlet for the viair air pump  it can't handle the amps in most cars . This pack is limited to 12 amps output so do not try to  use it either for the air pump unless it is a life and death emergency . When you use those air pumps you need to go off the battery with the car running . Be careful watch where the cord is with the moving parts . 
fits my car perfectly, works perfectly, was easy to install. The best measure of a wiper blade is that it does what it is supposed to do, when it is supposed to do it. They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. I bought this to do the brakes on my Porsche and it does not working very well it's too fat to fit in the space. 
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.  The pickle fork is the last resort for me, as it will damage the balljoint boot.I prefer to use the Snap On balljoint remover.  If that one cannot fit, then I will try this tool.  If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork. Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. 
Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truck I use this Dexron replacement fluid in my 12,000+ pound F-Super Duty utility truck's ZF 5 speed transmission and parking brake unit-Group IV synthetic, and able to take the shock loads of a gear oil! Be sure to check with the Auto or Truck Manufacturer to find the correct SIZE of Oil Filter for your vehicle. Amazon's Parts Locator says that the Motorcraft  FL820S does not fit my 1995 Mercury Grand Marquis, 4.6 Litre V-8 engine. This is incorrect. The fact is that the Motorcraft FL820S is the FORD-recommended filter for my 1995 Mercury engine, and is recommended in almost every application of the Ford /Mercury/Lincoln 4.6 Litre engine size.The Motorcraft FL820S interchanges with the BOSCH 3410, the FRAM TG2, and the K&N; 2010.The Motorcraft FL820S  has over 50 pleats, high flow rate, silicone anti-drainback valve, and steel end caps.Amazon's current low price ($3.69) is an excellent value for a quality oil filter that's MADE IN USA !!My car is driven in heavy traffic, desert temperatures, mountain driving, and trans-desert trips from Phoenix to L.A.The standard FORD Motorcraft Filters performed just as well as the high-dollar types -- and filtered MUCH better than the K&N;, which has a very high flow rate (for racing), but the low 90% efficiency rating of the K&N; makes it a no-no for extended oil changes. I wouldn't run a K&N; oil filter for more than 3,000 miles -- you'd just be stirring up dirty oil and pumping it through the bearings !! :>(For my American V-8 engine, I have found the best value to be the Motorcraft FL820S Oil Filter and Mobil 1 5-W-20 Extended Life (Synthetic) engine oil. The quality of the oil filter allows for filter changing every 5,000 miles, and the engine oil is changed once-a-year, regardless of miles driven.For maximum oil life, be sure your PCV system is working properly -- Remove and wash out the PCV Valve with Carburetor  Cleaner, and check for collapsed and/or damaged PCV hoses. A leaking PCV system will suck un-filtered dirt right into your engine !!1995 Mercury Grand Marquis RS225 HP 4.6 Litre SOHC V-8Modified Air Box w/ K&N; Air FilterBosch Impeller Fuel PumpBosch 19 Lb.

I ordered this set of mirrors to help me see behind my camper.  They are very easy to use and are very firmly mounted.  IMPORTANT: Go to the manufacturer's website to find the exact model for your truck.  The Amazon site might tell you the wrong model for your truck.  I recommend this product. GLAD  I  WENT  WITH  THE  CHROME AND  NOT  THE BLACK ONE, I  HOOKED  THIS ONE UP TO  MY GV1400 MOTORCYCLE IF  YOU  HAVE JUST  A  LITTLE  KNOW  HOW YOU CAN  DO  IT YOUR SELF , ALL  YOU WILL NEED TO GO WITH THIS IS A RELAY THAT DOES NOT COME WITH IT. YOU  CAN  GET IT ON HERE OR ANY PART STORE, I  HAVE MADE MANY PEOPLE JUMP  DUE  TO THE SOUND OF  THE  HORNS  LOUDNESS. Well this thing is as easy as tying your shoes laces. Plug in two wires, let it sit there for a few seconds and BOOM, it works. I still have to wait to fill up so I can calibrate that portion but everything else is good to go. This thing tells you everything you want to know about your vehicle components and more. The X-gauge is an awesome addition to an already great product. You can go the their website and review how to program the X-guages that are compatible with your specific vehicle. Don't wait like I did. Order this NOW!!! As usual Amazon came through with the shipping. If you don't want take my word for it, just look at the 300+ people that purchased it before me. Now I know exactly what my actual and average gas mileage is for my truck. 
I replaced the transmission fluild on a 2003 Saturn Ion with this sythetic fluid. Saturn says that it's a lifetime fill on the transmission but I felt much more comfortable changing it out at 100,000 miles with a synthetic. I feel like I will never have to worry about it again.Just like some other people stated the old fluid did come out looking suprisingly clean. I tossed in just shy of 2 quarts of the D4 fluid and tightened everything back down. It was fast and easy to do, I used a pry between the engine and transmission to get the drain bolt. Then used loktite on the bolts going back in as the manual suggests.I could not tell a difference but my girlfriend said she could. She claimed everything was smoother. Usually she gets about 300 miles per tank and she's been getting just over that now. I can't say that's due to the fluid but it's the only numbers I can supply.I am very happy with the swap I did and I would continue to use this fluid in the future if I had an application that called for it. After buying this, I'm now a Redline products fan for life. This simply is the best fuel system cleaner that your money can buy, period. I own a 1987 chevy silverado 5.7L TBI engine truck. I had a problem with it idling rough. It would idle a little bit rough once the engine warmed up, and a lot rough when the engine was cold. After using this stuff, I sometimes think that the engine has died. When it hasn't, its just idling so smooth. And that is not the only problem it cured. I used to have to run 93 octane if I didn't want to hear some bad valve clatter. It was rattling noise from the engine. After using this, I can run 87 octane with no valve clatter at all. Needless to say, I'm VERY impressed with this product. And to top it all off, its freakin' cheap! Ten bucks! I'm going to be buying more of this stuff, needless to say. I love this unit. Now I know in detail what's wrong with my car before I take it to the shop. This lessens the opportunity that the shop will try to upsell me on a service that I may not need. I also like the idea of being able to log the issues on my computer. I have used it on a 1993 Ford F150; 2001 Nissan Sentra; 3007 Lexus RX350 and a 2001 Cadi Deville 
It fits perfect on my riding mower 18.5 hp B&S engine.Phram is a excellent quality replacement oil filter for my mower engine Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars Bought this for work... do a lot of Toyota, scion, lexus oil filters... works good. nice tight fit and hasent stripped anything yet... 
I use this on all my auto bulbs. Helps when you need to remove bulbs especially on my trailers an vintage vehicles. This is a, Must Have Item. I recommend this Dielectric Grease. I purchased this belt for my 2003 Chevy Tahoe. I had no idea Chevy would put 2 serpentines on a newer generation vehicle. This smaller belt fits the A/C system only. It works like a champ and fits perfectly. I would recommend the Gatorback belts to EVERYONE! As an installation side note, you have to remove the air intake and larger serpentine to get to this "bottom of the motor" mounted unit.... way to engineer that one GM! I would install this on your Jeep as soon as you purchase the vehicle.  They're very easy to install and protect you from scratches that could lead to rust.  The guards fit perfectly on my 2011 Jeep Rubicon 2 door. 
My vehicle: 2004 Honda (Acura) TL 6-SPD J32A VTEC.The originals were made in the USA but these are made in Japan by NGK, or Nippon Touki (Japan Porcelain).  Iridium-tipped plugs are generally used on reciprocating powerplant-equipped airplanes.  Incidentally, Iridium/Platinum plugs are generally pre-gapped at factory and do not need re-gapping (some exceptions apply).  If re-gapped incorrectly, the tip would be damaged. These are well made, inexpensive, and work great. They are quality made in USA!And they had no shipping charges if added onto an existing Amazon order. What can one say, test leads they work and they are priced right one recommendation is to sell a kit with an assortment of ends. 
Does what it is designed to do and Amazon has great prices on them. But, if you are replacing yours on a ford f-250 with 5.4 go with 15718 with the longer cord. And a 2003 f250 w/5.4L only has 2 not 4 like it shows. I have few spare batteries can be used for various car appliances. This tool helps to quickly tap into power of each battery. Also my car battery tester uses the DC adapter (cigarette lighter type), so the test can be done easily on each battery with this adapter. This four station battery tender is just as simple to use as the single units.  One simply plugs the unit in and connects the battery via alligator clips or a connection affixed to the battery. Its a simple task to tell what state the battery is in.  If amber the battery is deep charging, if green range it is 80 to 100% charged.  After the battery is charged, leaving in connected will put the unit in float mode, which will keep the battery "topped off" without damaging it.  My only concern is the housing is plastic and all of my single units are metal.  It does have mounting holes so it can be wall mounted or affixed more securely to a shelf, etc.  Like the single units, total time from opening the box to charging is about 2 minutes.By the way, instructions for deciphering the state of the amber and green lights are not in the instruction manual but on the right side of the unit.I also ordered the 12 foot extension cables, a good call if you need to have your batteries more than about four feet from the unit. 
I don't need a gallon of this stuff.  I don't need a quart.  I don't even need a pint... so this was the perfect size to have on hand for occaional small engine reassembly and repair. When I ordered this, I was guaranteed fitment on a Toyota 3S-FE engine. When it arrived, it was not the correct size. i left two stars because I did run out and buy the correct size from another store, however, I didnt want to have to do this when I had all the rest of my parts shipped in. Another must have for the tool box.This is one of the best quality grease available. I only bought one tube because I don't need it often but when I do, its just a small amount.

It fits perfect on my riding mower 18.5 hp B&S engine.Phram is a excellent quality replacement oil filter for my mower engine I have previously used in: 1980 Honda CX500C to fix a rough idle, 2000 Suzuki SV650 to stabilize fuel, and a 2005 Chevy Cobalt to fix a problem with stalling at idle. Even though Amazon says it does not fit my truck; it does fit my 2002 Chevrolet 2500HD crew cab with 6.0L gas engine. I replaced both sensors and harness. Both sensors were rough looking and the rear sensor had standing water on it. It was a little bit of a chore to get to them because you have to remove the intake but it was not too bad. 
This is one-size-fits-most. It works on the filter for my 2002 Volkswagen Passat, but it's too large to grip the filter on my 1993 Chevrolet S10. 32mm is the correct size for my Jetta TDI oil cap, and this fits perfectly.It's also fairly low profile, another plus. Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles.

Primarily:  They do what they are supposed to for my 30 ft. trailer. Work well and easy.Secondarily: They came shipped in their own box, which is weak enough to need an outer box - arrived in pieces, but all metal held up, though scratched.  Needed to be a little less green to package the weight of 4 metal stands. Right part number and looks good.  Clean package box although the tube ends did not have the caps like Fram, but will take Motorcraft any day. These are great, but they didn't come with a bag.  TheTri-Lynx 00015 Lynx Leveler for RV Leveling Block with Nylon Storage Case, (Pack of 10)comes with a very nice bag that would actually work well for these wheel chocks.  It would be nice if they had included that or another bag for these (that would have earned the product 5 stars). 
Users might have trouble understanding exactly how to use the gauge without the instructions in hand because the design isn't intuitive.  But I do 'really like' this item.Simply taking a pressure reading is easy enough: Power on, hold it in your hand with your thumb on the raised bumps on that little slope above the big round button and press it against the valve until it beeps a couple of seconds later.  The reading is very accurate and the display easy to read in any weather condition.  And once you set your target pressures in the unit you can see how well your reading matches your preferred pressure.  On these points alone, I give it four stars, but not five for the following reasons.- The gauge powers off only a moment after you take a reading, so you have to start it again and select front or rear for each tire.  There should be a way to set how many seconds before it shuts off.- I don't even remember what the biggest button on the gauge does, but both its placement and the way it's marked causes you to naturally think it's the power and reset button.  It's not.  If I have to guess, it's probably "Enter" for when you're setting it up with your target tire pressures--I don't remember.- Bottom button, don't remember.  The bottom line on design here is, too many buttons which aren't intuitive or logically placed. I probably should compare it to another to see how accurate it is, but I really like how easy it is to use and turns off and on by itself. This is a high-quality, well made grease gun. It connects well, and you have to move the connection sideways to pop it off the grease fitting - which is perfect because you do not want on that pops off easily. I pumped a lot of grease through this into hubs and the pressure was high, the pump action was smooth and nothing leasked. When disconnected, it also does not leak (it does not pressure out unless you pump it). 
Just like fire needs oxygen, heat, and fuel, cars become roadblocks withoug gas, battery, and air.  You can carry more gas, and a second battery / electrical system, but air is hard to find, and with "service" stations removing it from their offerings of yesteryear, you need to have your own air system.What impressed me most about this compressor was the attachment point to the valvestem.  It is threaded and screws on, forming a seal during refil.  This seal is exceptional - good enough that the guage mounted on the compressor itself is accurate to set your tire pressure at the other end of the hose.  If you are filling a big tire, it will take some time, so this lets you sit back and relax while the motor works.  My tire chucks for shop air all require constant finger pressure to ensure a seal - not having to get tire chuck thumb was a nice side benefit!As for portable inflation systems, I've grown tired of anything with a cigarette lighter plug as the power source.  It's limited to 10 AMPs which gives you roughly 130-140 watts of power.  740 would be a full horsepower.  This compressor under load can draw 30 amps at 13V, for 390 watts - more than a half horsepower.  To do that they use clipon cable back to the battery.  Because I carry a second battery I clip on to it for the juice to run this.  It will also work with your main starting battery if you don't have a backup elecrical source.In the box you will find a carrying bag as well as an octogonal shaped piece of plastic - thats the air input filter - you need to screw it onto the air inlet to protect the compressor.  Its a quality unit so it needs protection.When all is said and done you have a 1/2 hp 12VDC compressor that gives you the freedom to set your tire pressure when and where you want to.  With the fast fill rate it takes very little time to top off your tires, if you want to drop your pressure for sand offroad and then refill it later when you hit asphalt this is a small but valuable tool to have in your emergency kit.The unit has a well balanced carrying handle to take it between tires and is light weight enough to take with you everywhere.  While you can use your car's starting battery, a second battery will prevent you from draining your starting battery.  When done, start up and drive away.If you seriously go offroad consider a highjack lift to get you out of a bind, or else a hydraulic system with a portable cylinder fed from your engine's hydraulic pump (if yours is equipped with one) or a secondary hydraulic system powered by your secondary electrical system - with all this you will not be stuck for long!Finally maintaining your tire pressure at proper levels for your load optimizes your fuel efficiency - at $3+ / gallon for fuel these days your efforts will pay for themselves shortly.While I have a 240VAC compressor in my shop, this is the first honest 12VDC compressor that does not take forever to fill a tire.  With a half horsepower air cooled motor it does the job quite well.  It's worth the money to keep onboard. Pros:Light weightLength is goodBias cut on the end is a great feature.Cons:Valve does not completely shut off water flow.Takes some serious pressure to turn off valve.This makes filling my RV potable water tank so much easier. Once it is full, I can shut off the water at the filler tube, rather than having to run back to the spigot. It also prevents excessive back flow. This is a high-quality, well made grease gun. It connects well, and you have to move the connection sideways to pop it off the grease fitting - which is perfect because you do not want on that pops off easily. I pumped a lot of grease through this into hubs and the pressure was high, the pump action was smooth and nothing leasked.

This little compressor has far exceeded my expectations. I have had two plumbed to an air tank that ran air tools on my rig. They run forever and have never gave me a problem. The only thing I would suggest is to switch out the male hose adaptor. This will allow you to run a regular sized higher quality hose that can attach to regular air tools/hoses in a pinch. The one that comes with it is an odd ball size. Don't get me wrong...you can't run air tools directly from this compressor. But using two into a tank makes it possible. I would buy another one in a heart beat. A little noisy but what compressor isn't?! It pushed a decent amount of air for the money. You need one for your vehicle so just buy it. Just like fire needs oxygen, heat, and fuel, cars become roadblocks withoug gas, battery, and air.  You can carry more gas, and a second battery / electrical system, but air is hard to find, and with "service" stations removing it from their offerings of yesteryear, you need to have your own air system.What impressed me most about this compressor was the attachment point to the valvestem.

With a half horsepower air cooled motor it does the job quite well.  It's worth the money to keep onboard. There is no swiveling between the cap, the tube and the bottle. In other words, when you screw/unscrew the cap onto the car's brake fluid container, there will be kinking on the tube itself. Untangling the kinks is a chore because the bottle is both quite big and heavy when it is filled with brake fluid. They should have designed with some quick-connect/disconnect like the compressor air hose. That would be an ideal solution, but I guess it will add to the cost for adding that feature. However, I doubt that it would cost much because I browsed through the air-hose connectors at Harbor Freight and they run typically a couple of bucks each. I might modify this bleeder with the air hose connector to address the problem. 
This doesn't fit my 2007 Toyota Tacoma factory hitch.  It needs to be 2 7/8".  The package on this lock reads 2 5/8 but I measured it at 2 3/4.  I'm going to have to grind the bolt.Update, Jan 2014.  An noted I had to grind the inside ends to make this fit in my Tacoma OEM hitch.  Once, it was ground to the proper length, I spray-painted the bolt and have used it to haul a 19-foot trailer and attach my tow hook ever since with no further problems. I installed this brake controller in a 1955 GMC pickup truck that I use for towing. Just follow the diagram for wiring and it just works like a breeze. I like the way you can adjust easily the voltage with the dial on the left and the mounts provided allows you to install it a convenient location under the dash (it works in any position).If you want to install this in a more modern truck without tapping directly into the wires, you will need additional adapters at extra cost. I purchased this to secure my motorcycle.  I use it on my 1976 FXE Harley's front rotor.  It works well and secures the front with the lock and visible indication to hopefully make the thief move on to another bike.  The only problem I had with it was I wanted to put it on my rear wheel because that makes it much harder for a thief to take the bike.  My rotor's holes are too small for the pin to fit and the throat barely fit due to my rotor's thickness.  It does however fit well on my front rotor.Bottom line, this is a good, low cost solution to add as one additional layer of theft protection for your motorcycle. 
These trays are fantastic. No more accidentally dropping a cup of fasteners or kicking one across the garage and then having to hunt for it. Just place everything you take off into the tray and it stays put. They are also cheap enough to get a couple different sizes to help organization during a big job. UPDATE - Ok... it does leak. I certainly would never call it "Water Proof" it is more "Water Resistant" so you definitely want to pack things in garbage bags if you want to keep the contents completely dry.We have been considering a roof top cargo bag for several years. It seems like we are running out of room when we travel. Our solution had always been to just be more judicious in what we packed, but now that we have a baby we began to run out of options. Enter the Keeper Waterproof Roof Top Cargo Bag.Some General Notes+ This thing holds A LOT of stuff. In fact, it really is like a second trunk. We were able to fit two big duffle bags into the cargo bag and still have plenty of additional space.+ Now quite proof - more like "Water Resistant". The cargo bag only has one zipper which is hidden under a double-flap that velcros together. On our trip we only experienced a light snow, but everything remained dry.+ The Zipper works pretty well - I have noticed in many duffel bags (and backpacks) that the zipper is the thing that typically fails. So far we have not had a problem with this cargo bag (I will update my review if it does fail)Other things to considerIf you are purchasing the Keeper Roof Top Cargo Bag you may also want to considerSherpak SuperMat Roof Matfor the protection of your roof. The Supermat also provides an anti-slip surface and should also help with gas mileage since it works as an additional wind barrier (between the cargo bag and your vehicles roof).- This thing will wreck havoc on your gas mileage. For us we lost about 3-4MPGS and that is with the Supermat.- Not the easiest thing to tie-down. The fasteners and straps are mediocre at best so it was a bit of a challenge to get this thing tight to the roof.- Consider packing during the day - the bag and the fasteners are black, so without the use of a flashlight it is very difficult attaching this thing at nightOne more piece of advice, once the cargo bag is loaded make sure you do a test drive at the maximum speed you intend on driving. Once you return doube check all of the straps and do a little secondary tightening.Final Verdict - While it was a little difficult fastening to the roof the Keeper Cargo Bag met my expectations.4 Stars Forget about those tiny little drip pans that you have to constantly adjust to avoid spilling. This is very large and the integrated spout makes it very easy to transfer the old oil into another container.The only possible negative is that because there isn't a lid I have to store it in a garbage bag to prevent the kids from getting into it. 
This just slides on the handle and lift bar to eliminate rattling while driving with a hi lift jack. It's cheap and easy, what more do you want? Fits my hi-lift jack perfectly, which is mounted on the roof rack of my Jeep, and keeps the handle from rattling like crazy every time I hit the slightest bump.  Must-have for anyone riding with a high-lift jack in their vehicle. Looks great, easy install, will help back passengers when top is down, since there is nothing to hold on too, low profile, does not get in the way of view. (Jeep Wrangler 2013 2 door) 
You have to have this. Mounts most typically on the outside of the RV.. Just tilt the outside door/vent open and Olsen the peacock valve. No tools required!  Very cool! This works very well for blowing out water supply lines in an RV's plumbing system.  Be aware that there can be water still in the lines even after blowing out air through every faucet, so when winterizing, it can't hurt to use a RV safe antifreeze just to keep the water at the low spots (elbows, valves) from freezing. This kit makes it super easy to winterize your camper. This 3 way valve will allow you to easily the pump pull from the gallons of pink RV antifreeze. When spring comes around you just need to turn the valve so it pulls from your fresh water tank and flush out the lines with fresh water. 
These are great, but they didn't come with a bag.  TheTri-Lynx 00015 Lynx Leveler for RV Leveling Block with Nylon Storage Case, (Pack of 10)comes with a very nice bag that would actually work well for these wheel chocks.  It would be nice if they had included that or another bag for these (that would have earned the product 5 stars). My intention was to have a minimal first aid kit for the car.  This little pack is reasonably well constructed, small, and even has belt loops (that I'll never use, but a great thought).  It's not going to handle major trauma, but for the occassional bandage, insect sting, wound cleaning, or field dressing, it's what you need.  There's enough extra room in the case to add two or three more items to personalize the assortment.  The contents are packaged in 3 mini zip-lock baggies, and there are common refills available for it all. Overall the kit is pretty decent. The case is nice and touch and all of the leads and attachments work well. Will detail them out next. The main issue I have is that the kit is not exactly as shown/advertised.Carrying Bag:The included bag is a very nice heavy duty bag. It&#8217;s a tri-fold bag with 3 pouches sealed with very nice heavy duty Velcro. There is some extra room in at least 2 of the pouches to store additional wires while still being able to close the bag properly.Main Lead wires:The main leads are nice, each end includes a nice cap to keep them clean and free of debris. The lead wires are 18AWG and overall are very nice. They fit into my DMM perfectly and the attachments clip on easily as well except the alligator clips (details below)Test Probes:The test probes are nice, but larger than I expected from the product images. They double as banana clips which is a nice addition. They have plastic covers, that while on cover up the banana clip part leaving only the test probe tip exposed. Again this is nice to keep things well insulated when needed. The major issue I had was that the probes alone are much thicker than I had expected from the images and with the covers on they are even thicker. This doesn&#8217;t make them bad, just slightly misrepresented and not the best for smaller electronics work.Mini Hooks:The mini hook attachments are very nice they have a perfectly tensioned spring for smaller electronics work. The hook pops out easy and the tension from the spring is tight enough to keep it well attached but not too much as to bend wires. Overall these are very good attachments and work well with smaller electronicsAlligator clips:These are where my major complaint is, and the largest reason for the lower rating. The clips I received are nothing like what is in the product images. Please view the customer added image gallery sections full a full library of all of the products in this set. In that gallery you will see that the alligator clips included are very heavy duty. They are nice clips, but not what was shown to come with this set. They are hard to attach to the lead wires and are too large and strong to work with many smaller electronics products. If you try and remove the insulator boot you find that the clips are nice but the end is completely bare. This was a disappointment. Again please see the customer image gallery for detailsConclusions:Overall this is a good kit, and contains some good parts for small electronics but the test probes are larger that depicted and the alligator clips are miles away from what was expected to be with this kit. I would like to give this product a 4 or 5 start rating, as the products are not &#8220;bad&#8221; they are just not what was represented in the pictures and product info. This is a kit meant for larger electrician or automotive electrical work maybe. This kit is not the best for small electrics hobbyists. That said, the price may be low enough to be worth he bag and the couple parts that are good for the small electronics work.Please review the image gallery and determine if they will be worth the money.**If this review was helpful please click the button below** 
Used part of it on my 2012 VW Jetta Sportwagen TDI.  Great design - the twist shut off valve is a very practical feature.  Took off the very tip of the funnel (and put the rest aside) and attached it to a plastic hose that I had attached to a 2-gallon Home Depot pump sprayer.  Tip fit perfectly over the hole in the transmission filter housing and into the plastic hose.  Was able to pump in 6 liters in MUCH less time (and no mess) and use the &#34;snorkel&#34; or standpipe to drain off the excess, after running the DSG through the gears and getting temp up to about 40c.  Pumping in 6 liters dilutes and flushes out the dirty fluid caught up in the fluid cooler, the transmission body and the shifting channels.  Result:  a much better DSG service than the dealer provides. Hooking up this valve will make winterizing a recreation vehicle. I place the tread tape on the water pump (facing the valve), and the threads that will connect the water tank and the pump. The plastic grey connector is easier to connect to pump first the tighten it down with a wrench. Now attach the valve to the pump by spinning the valve until tight and snug it up with tools. now attach hose from tank to valve until it is tight. I left the metal cap on until I need to winterize the camper again, but you can leave the hose on the by-pass valve if you likeand curl it up next to the pump. Just make sure you can read the wording on the valve for position it is in. Now you are ready to winterize the pipes at anytime you want. Before it took me about 1 hour to winterize a camper. This was switching the hose from the water tank to a hose to a gallon of RV anti-freeze. Since it took me 15 minutes to install, now the amount of time it will take to winterize my camper will be 5 minutes and no more banged up hands from working in a small area. That is the time to turn the valve and run a gallon of rv anti-freeze thru the system and resetting valve back to water tank. This tool is perfect for solo bleeding brakes. All you do is attach it to a bottle/jar/container via some adapters and tubing and then bleed away without the fear of getting air back into the brake lines.The only tiny problem is that the tubing attached to the bleeder screw is a air tight one way check valve so when you take it off a large amount of brake fluid is trapped on the intake side of the tube and if your not careful may make quite a mess on the calipher. I wish they included some button on the tool to open the check valve fully to allow the excess fluid trapped in the tubing to flow downward into the container to minimize the chances to make a mess. 
I have a Jeep Rubicon. Off road or on the beach there are times I need to air down the tires. After a day of fun I need to air the tires back up. Enter the Viair.This is as rugged, fast and dependable cigaret lighter powered air compressor as I've used or seen. I have large tires and this will air up a 17&#34;  P265 tire in a couple of minutes.I do notice some heat around the pump's housing after the second tire. A short rest (just to be nice to the compressor) and the other two tires go up without a hitch.I can heartily recommend this compressor. I have a 1993 M35A3 with 6 Michelin 14.5 XLs and a spare.  The CTIS (central tire inflation system) had been disconnected, and the split wheel o-rings need to be replaced.  This means that I have 7 huge tires with slow leaks.  I have the truck in an apartment complex parking lot with no electricity for my big Makita 5hp compressor.  And my honda generator cant crank over the Makita.  I had a little red compressor from VIAR, which was good in the emergency I needed it for, but got so hot in inflating these tires that it melted the yellow hose.The 450P was hooked up to my yellow goodyear hose and Subaru Outback (running), and put to work right out of the box.  It took 5 of these tires from 15 lbs or less to 45 lbs in about 35 minutes.  When you have 13,000 lbs of truck, having tires that roll is critical, because even a wrecker can't move them with deflated tires.  The pump was hot, but the inflating pipe on the compressor runs through the padded handle, which allows you to pick it up when hot.  The gauge has a trigger and a  lever that holds fitting on to the tire valve, which is really handy.  Having a switch vs using the battery clamps to start saves on sparking.I was at a loss as to how I was going to get these tires inflated in remote situations with out a huge generator to run a huge compressor...so this continuous duty 12v pump was very timely.(for those of you who are military truck experts, I am aware the M35A3 has an on board compressor, but there is a blockage somewhere ahead of the 'glad hands.')  The M35A3 is about the largest truck (23,000 lbs gvw) you can drive in NC without a license , and has 7 really big tires to say grace over.  This is not a replacement for a functioning CTIS or a big compressor, but will get even the largest tires inflated and rolling. I was in need of an Air Compressor but I did not want to get one that was huge.  This little guy is pretty small and does the job!  You set your PSI, plug it in and hook up to whatever needs air.  The Air Compressor will stop automatically once it reaches the preset PSI.  It is awesom if it ever breaks down I will be picking up another! 
Perfect for exhaust work.  I bought it for a catalytic converter and o2 sensor project because it is rated for: -30F to 1800F I am installing these on a 02 chevy avalanche 1500 5.3L v8. they are a exact replacement of oem. AC Delco all the way... good stuff. Exact fit for Lexus RX300. As easy to install as I could've expected with all parts: the sensor, the cable and  the plug matching the original layout. 
This filter was easy to install and fit well. Even a caveman could do it. Much cheaper than having a dealer do it. I am actually not commenting on the filter, but on the fact that the Amazon site will tell you that this will fit your 2013 Mazda 3.  This is ONLY true if you do not have the Skyactiv version of the Mazda 3.  The filter itself is fine.  However, I did end up having to go the dealer and get the 2013 Skyactiv version, and the seal along the top of the Mazda version is much more flexible (almost like a gasket). paid $3.17 here ....... cheaper than "wally world". I bought three as these work on my motorcycles. filters the dirt, protect my engine.the "classic" purolator filter is way better than a fram (more pleats of filter media) IMO.I'm using these on a Kawasaki EX 500 Ninja but the L14610 will fit any Kawasaki or Honda motorcycle that uses a cartridge oil filter and has enough room , these are approx. 3.25 inches in length .....Or you can use the L14612 which is shorter (2.5 inches in length).why give your hard earned money for the oem filters which are made as cheaply as the motorcycle manufacturer can buy them and branded with their logo.....crappy filters is what you get from the dealer..... I want my stuff to last, LOL. 
Used it today (again) when the mechanic's garagesensor tool failed !Pros:Solid, beefy, MUCH stronger than other sensor sockets.Reasonable priceDual 1/4" wrench & socket end (don't know what size that is).Deep channel socket - will not damage the sensor wires when installingor removing a sensor - unlike other brands.Cons:Wish it was even thicker ??Would buy again. Installed on my 2006 Rubicon Unlimited. It looks good. It installed cleanly with the supplied hardware and wrench. I like the type of key and the lock opperates smoothly. I feel better knowing it is there to protect my vehicle from gas theft or tampering. Used this on A  Brute force 750.  Extended the rear hitch out past the back bsket.  No need to crawl under and past the basket to get the hitch.  iIt is solid thru and thru.  It is not a hollow tube.  But a solid piece of piece of steel with the holes drilled in it, where the hitch mets the extender.  I have used this extender on my F250 and Dodge aslo to haul a 7000 lb. piece of equipment.  No problems whatsoever with it. Built tuff and made to take on a ram.  You won't be disappointed if you buy this and need the extra length of extension for your hitch on any vehicle. 
Used this to replace the stock intake tube on a 2004 Tahoe 5.3L V8. In conjunction with a K&N panel filter it has added a nice distant intake rumble at higher RPMs without being noticeable while cruising along. There was a small power gain which I noticed at lower RPMs where the transmission would normally downshift it can now pull a little harder from higher gears (overdrive, etc). It also freed up room under the hood which makes accessing the accessory belts easier. I use this on older Lycoming engines where they used clamps with a short rubber hose between the metal tubes for the intake. This is much easier to snake around exhaust etc to the clamp then regular pliers. This seems to be one of the better levelers. There are two different scales on these levels. One is for the side-to-side (back of the coach) and the other is for the front-to-back (side of the coach). The reason there are different scales are they are more-or-less calibrated in inches.For example, it is simple Trigonometry to determine how many inches the coach is out of level simply by using the formula for right-angles and solve for one side. The input values are the angle (determined by the level) and distance from the level to the point at where you want to know how many inches of lift are needed.For the side-to-side level, the 1&#34; markings are pretty accurate as long as you put the scale in the center of the coach, as most coaches are within an inch or two of width from another.  However, for the front-to-back level, even though you put the scale in the center, the result will vary wildly due to the length of the coach. Using this level on a 18ft coach will result in a far different measurement than say a 35ft coach.Also, if you don't put the level in the center (in the side or back), then the two ends of the coach will be different. For example, if the level is in the center, then when the level measures 1&#34; off level, that means 1&#34; on either front or back. But if you put the level off-center, then the level reading 1&#34; might truly be 1/2&#34; on one end, and 1 1/2&#34; on the other. Again, it is simply a principle of Right Angles in Trigonometry.Also, do not rely on the self-adhesive backing as over time it can move. As hard as it may be for you to do, drilling a couple holes and inserting screws into the levels is the best bet. 
These worked great to lift my car - very stable and sturdy, and I like that they were made in the USA.  A quality product. OTC is reliable, and this is also reliable.  The parts are durable and machined well.  If you wok on front ends, you need this kit.  The case is also durable. I purchased this product for my parents to use on a ceiling vent.  They were pleased with the product overall.  It was sturdy, easy to install, and serves the purpose of the purchase.  They said the magnet held on well also. 
Some hardware stores carry this in 8 oz. containers.  It is a buck or two cheaper to order it here and have it delivered.  It works better than naval jelly.  Not particularly recommended for show quality applications.I pour a little our on a 2&#34; paint brush to coat rusted ferrous metal.It stops rust and turns it black.Good for tools and equipment that have a tendency to rust.It is thicker that some of the phosphoric acid products and leaves a coating that can be painted over.I am using it on a rusty utility trailer and an old tractor.You don't have to paint it but you can.It kills the rust. The rubber protector is a nice to have addition but it's a bit of a pain to install. You have to unscrew the hose from the gauge (wrenches required) and it's a tight fit - some type of lubricant (e.g. a little diluted liquid soap) will help. I used teflon tape (the stuff used for plumbing fixtures) when reattaching the hose - works well and is better than whatever was used at the factory. This product is more of a glaze than a swirl remover.  While it does have some cutting ability it may not work well on new clear coat paint.  If you use this product I recommend to top it off with a good quality wax or sealant such as Meguiar's  Ultimate Wax.  (paste or liquid) 
Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!! They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. 
I like these for 2 reasons:  Works as a wheel chock (quick on and quick off)... also helps our camper from rocking front to back when people are walking inside.  I have had these on about a year now (our camper is set-up all the time at the lake property) and these are still in good shape - not weathered.  I recommend. This is my second; added a large touring motorcycle to my garage, so I needed something to leave in the trunk for use in foul weather. I like the Nelson-Riggs because, once dry, they fold into a small, easy-to-store roll that doesn't hog storage space. The first is into its seventh year now, getting a bit shabby, but still as effective at keeping the wind and rain out as it was when I bought it. The hi-viz color on top is something of a plus; I'm no longer forced to carry a hi-viz vest to put over my rain gear. Good, modestly-priced gear that's easier to see in low-visibility conditions. All in all it took me a little while to get these set up on my 1982 Yamaha XJ650.  Once I found a configuration that I liked and worked for me, I loaded some random things in to the bags and took a spin.  They did quite well very little sag from the bags.  I think these will be great for long rides to carry water, snacks, rain gear, spare visor and some extra tools.  I suggest these bags if you don't want to invest in leather or PVC bags, or just want something to carry some items and you are sick of having a back pack on while riding.  They hold my lunch and laptop for work quite well.  I has been nice the last few days not having to have a back pack on my back.The down side is the way they sit on the bike and they design of the bike make it hard to have the bags on and have a passenger, however this will differ for everyone depending on the bike you have. 
Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars Even though Amazon says it does not fit my truck; it does fit my 2002 Chevrolet 2500HD crew cab with 6.0L gas engine. I replaced both sensors and harness. Both sensors were rough looking and the rear sensor had standing water on it. It was a little bit of a chore to get to them because you have to remove the intake but it was not too bad. Fit my '98 Nissan Frontier's oil pan perfectly. Looks to be of nice quality.  Torque to 25ft/lbs (on the Frontier anyway) 
The size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous. The funnel is 10" long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6" long. It states that the funnel is 4" x 4" but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2-1/4" in diameter at the widest point.It would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless. A good Made in USA chock.  It may cost about a buck less each at Walmart, if you can find it.There is a hole in the side for a rope to hold one or two together for each side of the tire.  Don't buy the one with a rope. It costs twice as much for the same one chock, NOT two.The heavy rubber  Buyers Rubber Wheel Chock - 5in.W, Model# WC1467A  at $8.99 each at Northern Tools are heavier and provides a better grip on concrete, but they are heavy to carry around.  I use the Buyers' ones in the garage and carry the Camco ones in my trunk.Also NOTE that the Buyer's ones are made in the same place as the expensive Race Ramps Branded ones costing 50% more.  The Buyers ones are nearly identical, are exactly the same size and weight.  The Race Ramps ones have shallow slits cut into the bottom. Need 2 for each side, works well for small pop up. Buy these over ones w/ rope and add your own rope, same choke. These already have the hole for rope. Dimensions given are inaccurate on these two, they are exactly the same size. 
I did not receive what is shown in the picture.  It does not have the two round lids that turn on top, but rather a hinged lid held by two thumb screws.  Doesn't really matter, as it works just the same.  This is a nice cover, and I'm happy with it.  It looks better than the one it replaced. Really like the way it looks on my black 2 door JK. Fit was right on spot. It doesn't deflect everything but really cut down on the layer of bugs on my windshield. I thought this was going to have a bubble in it but it doesn't. Its really flat. And it is perfect for the purpose I was looking for. And its crystal clear. You can really see the plate and the frame. And it looks even better at night. 
First, as with all of the Dupli-Color Metalcast paints, if you want the metalcast effect, you'll have to use the Dupli-Color Metalcast Ground Coat (MC100) on the surface before you apply the color or it will not come out right. The can says that it also comes out the same if you're painting directly onto chrome like surface but I have not tried this so I don't know. Now for this green. I'm more of a blue and purple guy for dark colors so only by my personal preference do I say that this green comes out just a tad light in color for me. Overall though, if you use the ground coat this comes out great with a nice metal sheen. I recommend this product. The tool is a quality item that is well constructed and looks like it will last a lifetime. I have absolutely no complaint with the quality or construction but did note that the tool I received did not match the picture that should not be allowed for online sellers. My handle was grey in color instead of the advertised red. This does not detract from the tool's performance but I do find it unusual that Lilse would choose a dull color such as grey instead of a bright color that stands out. The grey acts as a camouflage if you drop it or set it down in your engine compartment making it hard to see and fish out from behind your firewall especially in poor lighting. The tool was a lot bigger than what I was expecting but that was actually something I liked. This tool will not help with all electrical connectors on every make and model due to the many different designs but is a welcome addition to my tool chest. Would definitely buy again if needed but would select the easier to see red handled version if I had the choice. I purchased this product based on positive reviews by amazon.com customers to restore the rear trim on my 1998 Buick Riviera. While it makes a nice shine, Back to Black did NOT make the trim black again; it remains grey. I expected a more drastic improvement, like some of the tire shine products.In fact, I tried Black Magic &#34;Tire Wet&#34; on the rear trim, and it provides at least as good a shine as Back to Black.Bottom line : product is okay, but will not by any means restore black trim back to black 
Got these for $25 shipped, and they look good.  Can't understand why Chrysler does not include these from the factory. I bought these to haul my two kayaks.  Works great.  I would have given 5 stars, but it does not come with any reflectors or padding material.  Also, the flag it comes with was missing my first order, Amazon sent me a new one, but the flag is real cheap...just a piece of red thin plastic. These are well made, inexpensive, and work great. They are quality made in USA!And they had no shipping charges if added onto an existing Amazon order. 
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. I purchased this to be able to attach a high-end hydraulic assisted bike rake on the back of my Jeeps (JKs) with the rear tire still on.  It fit perfectly and teamed with the Bolt Lock BLT7018448 5/8'' Receiver Lock (Keyed specifically for your line of vehicle) it can be kept in the Jeep and my daughter doesn't need anything but her car key.The extender is exactly as advertised, well made, fit perfectly and does eactly what it is inteded for. 
I put these in my '03 TJ Jeep Wrangler.  They fit perfect and work exactly as you'd expect they should.  I installed a set of 55w HIDs in them and the light output is tremendous. This is a very solid product.  I had purchased another brand that claimed to be 'universal' but it did not fit the larger Airstream coupler.  The product fit although I did have to turn it backward (key hole facing the trailer). Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!! 
It's so much cheaper to buy these large tubes on Amazon instead of the little ones at the hardware store. You can use JB weld on just about everything!For anyone new to JB Weld though, be really sure you mix the two parts in very very close to equal amounts. Otherwise it will never completely harden. This is a good starter kit for setting up a basic inverter system.  All three cables appear to be made well. The best thing about this product is the price.  You would be hard pressed making these cables yourself for the price. The cap quality and function appear to be just fine. It may just save my engine someday. Price was right also. 
Fit my '98 Nissan Frontier's oil pan perfectly. Looks to be of nice quality.  Torque to 25ft/lbs (on the Frontier anyway) The lock it self looks like a quality built.  Heavy and shiny.  But sadly, it does not fit my 2004 Honda VTX1300c on either rotors. Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. 
Fit my '98 Nissan Frontier's oil pan perfectly. Looks to be of nice quality.  Torque to 25ft/lbs (on the Frontier anyway) work great for my John Deere X500 Perfect fit for rear window on my 2004 Ford Excursion Limited. Easy to install. No spotting seen or squeaking at all 
These did not fit my '08 suburban, the description said w/ 9x3 hook, so I assumed that to be included. It wasn't and I was unable to use these on my '08 suburban. I welded a piece of flat stock on the insert for the motorhome. This adapter is for my Dodge Grand Caravan. The P3 arrived exactly as described but my order was "lost" for 6 days between the printing of the shipping label and pick up by the P.O. No explaination was given when I contacted the company. Other than that I'm very satisfied with both the P3's function and performance. My only problem was mounting the unit in my 2012 Tundra. The plug in adaptor which I also purchased, mated up perfectly with the pre wired harness, included with Toyota's optional "tow package". Older Tundras and some of the 2012 models came with a pre wired harness about 1 foot long, but my 2012 was delivered with the new and improved shorter version, (something to do with safety) and is only about 3 inches long. The longer harness, coupled with the plug in adaptor, allowed mounting the P3 to the right side of the steering wheel by the center console, out of the way. Unfortunately, some later model Tundras, like mine, have the 3" pre wire harness, which restricts mounting the P3 just to the right of the hood release and directly above the emergency brake pedal. If I'm not extreemly careful, with my size 13 shoe, I inadvertently step on the face of the P3 when applying the emergency brake. If you leave the 2 mounting screws a little loose you can tilt the P3 up which gives you a little more clearance between the E brake and the P3 and all is good.. 
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend. This fit my 2007 Jeep Grand Cherokee V6. Price was great when I purchased. Can't beat having car parts shipped to your door for free. 
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted.

I love Lynx products, these caps fit properly and do what they are supposed to do. I would buy again. It fits perfectly and it is inexpensive, what more do you need? Good for the do it yourself oil changer. I installed on a 2003 4Runner. I didnt need all the pieces but this kit had what i needed.  I may use the other pieces at a later time, so this kit for the price was a great investment.  Very hight quality.

The thread chaser is a sort of thread tap that is intended to help restore the female threads in your cars exhaust system when installing that expensive, new oxygen sensor. It does its job if used correctly; which is to advance it slowly with a forward-and-back motion to clear the chips and debris, while keeping it oiled. If you work on cars and front ends, you'll eventually need a tool like this for your CV boots.  Not all CV boots require this, but this particular one allows for torque wrenches or breakers bars to &#34;pinch&#34; the CV boot clamp for proper installation of your boot when applicable. This is the best lubricant to use on your bike chain for quiet operation and rust protection. It has a deep penetrating action to reach every part of the chain. It even comes with a thin tube that fits into nozzle to apply a few drops to the chain. It will extend the life of the chain and of the gear derailleur systems.The built in solvents soften and remove dirt and contaminants while displacing water to prevent rust and corrosion. It does not leave behind a layer of grease to collect and hold dirt and sand and act as an abrasive to the bikes chain and gear system.Tri-flow reduces chain and gear cog wear. It is also great for the rear derailleur to maintain crisp and accurate gear changes and to keep all of the components moving smoothly. It also works on the front derailleur system the same way.Tri-flow contains petroleum lubricants and Teflon particles so make sure to shake it well before you use it. I use it to maintain my bikes. It has many other applications and just like it states on the label, it is a superior lubricant.

It filters oil and comes with the gasket and crush washer you need to change the oil This is one the best oil filters on the market for the Harley-Davidson Motorcycles. I use these filters on my 2007 Harley-Davidson Fatboy Motorcycle because they do a great job in filtering my oil. The oil filter on my Harley is mounted on the front of the engine. This location plus the fact the crank position sensor is in the way of using most oil filter wrenches, you have to buy a special wrench, which will slip in use, to remove the oil filter . This oil filter has a 17mm nut welded on end of the filter housing, this makes installing or removing the oil filter very easy. You don't have to worry about damaging your Engine Crank Position Sensor which are expensive to replace. I highly recommend this great K&N Performance Oil Filter for any Harley-Davidson Motorcycle owner who uses regular or synthetic motor oil. Great price and it's chrome plated to boot. Don't waste your money on Fram filters. Mann filters will not fail you if you plan on a long oil interval in excess of 5k miles.Fit my E39 528i perfectly. It also came with the correct o-ring to seal the oil filter housing. Just buy it already! 
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Bought this for work... do a lot of Toyota, scion, lexus oil filters... works good. nice tight fit and hasent stripped anything yet... 
The tool appears to be of average quality.  However, I returned it to Amazon since it did not fit up to a Ford Taurus flex fuel engine.  This type of engine requires a special fitting that this tool does not have. works perfectly for my RC lipo charger at home letting me ditch the cheap charger that came iwith my heli. This makes it SO easy to charge in conjunction with my battery tender.  So far it has fit all my vehicles batteries ( Acura integra, Toyota Tundra, Toyota Pickup )

I am installing these on a 02 chevy avalanche 1500 5.3L v8. they are a exact replacement of oem. AC Delco all the way... good stuff. Be sure to check with the Auto or Truck Manufacturer to find the correct SIZE of Oil Filter for your vehicle. Amazon's Parts Locator says that the Motorcraft  FL820S does not fit my 1995 Mercury Grand Marquis, 4.6 Litre V-8 engine. This is incorrect. The fact is that the Motorcraft FL820S is the FORD-recommended filter for my 1995 Mercury engine, and is recommended in almost every application of the Ford /Mercury/Lincoln 4.6 Litre engine size.The Motorcraft FL820S interchanges with the BOSCH 3410, the FRAM TG2, and the K&N; 2010.The Motorcraft FL820S  has over 50 pleats, high flow rate, silicone anti-drainback valve, and steel end caps.Amazon's current low price ($3.69) is an excellent value for a quality oil filter that's MADE IN USA !!My car is driven in heavy traffic, desert temperatures, mountain driving, and trans-desert trips from Phoenix to L.A.The standard FORD Motorcraft Filters performed just as well as the high-dollar types -- and filtered MUCH better than the K&N;, which has a very high flow rate (for racing), but the low 90% efficiency rating of the K&N; makes it a no-no for extended oil changes. I wouldn't run a K&N; oil filter for more than 3,000 miles -- you'd just be stirring up dirty oil and pumping it through the bearings !! :>(For my American V-8 engine, I have found the best value to be the Motorcraft FL820S Oil Filter and Mobil 1 5-W-20 Extended Life (Synthetic) engine oil. The quality of the oil filter allows for filter changing every 5,000 miles, and the engine oil is changed once-a-year, regardless of miles driven.For maximum oil life, be sure your PCV system is working properly -- Remove and wash out the PCV Valve with Carburetor  Cleaner, and check for collapsed and/or damaged PCV hoses. A leaking PCV system will suck un-filtered dirt right into your engine !!1995 Mercury Grand Marquis RS225 HP 4.6 Litre SOHC V-8Modified Air Box w/ K&N; Air FilterBosch Impeller Fuel PumpBosch 19 Lb.

Filter wrench works ok for cars or truck.  Can not use easily with Harley Davidson Filters.  Not enough room to get a hold of the filter using this wrench on Harley's. Even though Amazon says it does not fit my truck; it does fit my 2002 Chevrolet 2500HD crew cab with 6.0L gas engine. I replaced both sensors and harness. Both sensors were rough looking and the rear sensor had standing water on it. It was a little bit of a chore to get to them because you have to remove the intake but it was not too bad. Good cabin air filter. Installed in 08 Mazda 5. It is a bit of trouble to change this filter. Also filter is a little awkward getting in for installation. Overall does a god job filtering air inside van. Product is must have and cheaper than dealership. Just be patient with install.

This cabin filter is a perfect fit replacement filter for a 2004 4Runner V8 Sport.  Just slide the old one out and put this one in. Fits perfectly for my 2003 Toyota Camry, but the number of folds in the filter were fewer than the OEM one. It's short 10 folds compared to the Toyota OEM cabin air filter. 
Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.  The pickle fork is the last resort for me, as it will damage the balljoint boot.I prefer to use the Snap On balljoint remover.  If that one cannot fit, then I will try this tool.  If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork. Works great. Fairly easy swap.

I haven't really used it yet for the reason intended, changing the oil in my jet ski.  So, I can't comment on how well it works.  The main reason for this review is to put it out there that it does not work with a 2000 Chevy Silverado.  The siphon tube does not fit thru the bottom of the dip stick tube.  It would be really nice if Mityvac had a published list of what vehicles it works with and what ones it does not.  I have my fingers crossed that it'll work with my jet ski, otherwise there will be a new/(un)used Mityvac on *****'slist.  Long story short, do your research to see if you can confirm or deny if it will work with your vehicle before you buy it.

I installed one of these springs at the bottom of the door.  As others have said, 1 seems plenty strong to close the door without making it slam.  If you only hold the door a few inches open, it won't latch.  But if you open it like you are walking out it will close tight and the latch engages.I think installing the second spring will make the door slam too hard.  But its nice having the second spring just in case you need it.I installed it using the existing screw on the outside of the screen door (where the hinge attaches).  I think measured up 9" (as the directions say) and drilled a hole such that the spring fits between the screen door and the outside door when they are both closed.- to be clear - when you are standing outside the camper, with the screen door closed, you see the spring go from the hinge on the screen door to the door frame.The pictures in the directions seemed a little confusing to me.  It looks more like they want you to put the spring on the inside of the door.  But then you have the spring dragging across the frame when you open the door, scratching the frame and probably making a lot of noise.My way of installing it has zero noise (the spring is not rubbing on anything) and it works nicely.Just make sure there is adequate clearance between your outside door and your screen door before installing the spring.I will take a picture if I get a chance and post it.*** UPDATE ***I added a picture with notes.We had the camper out for 5 days and the spring worked great.  Using just 1 spring is enough to close the screen door and it even will pull the combined screen & exterior doors closed.  (not hard enough to latch, but closed).  I think I will leave it as-is and keep the second spring as a backup. Fits my 2002 Silverado LS 5.3L vortec RWD, extended cab. Very simple install, DON'T remove the third bolt closest to the driver side of the under dash shield, you can move it out of the way without taking it all the way off, saving you a headache trying to line the cover back up again. Doesn't have a &#34;fresh breeze&#34; smell and I can still smell the dirty air of city driving, but still a HUGE upgrade from what I had in there. Basically a pile of dirt and leaves with some filter in the middle. Air flow is superb. I use this to open my screen door without having to to open the sliding panel to reach inside to open the door.  Keeps bugs out while making the door easier to open from outside. 
I installed one of these springs at the bottom of the door.  As others have said, 1 seems plenty strong to close the door without making it slam.  If you only hold the door a few inches open, it won't latch.  But if you open it like you are walking out it will close tight and the latch engages.I think installing the second spring will make the door slam too hard.  But its nice having the second spring just in case you need it.I installed it using the existing screw on the outside of the screen door (where the hinge attaches).  I think measured up 9" (as the directions say) and drilled a hole such that the spring fits between the screen door and the outside door when they are both closed.- to be clear - when you are standing outside the camper, with the screen door closed, you see the spring go from the hinge on the screen door to the door frame.The pictures in the directions seemed a little confusing to me.  It looks more like they want you to put the spring on the inside of the door.  But then you have the spring dragging across the frame when you open the door, scratching the frame and probably making a lot of noise.My way of installing it has zero noise (the spring is not rubbing on anything) and it works nicely.Just make sure there is adequate clearance between your outside door and your screen door before installing the spring.I will take a picture if I get a chance and post it.*** UPDATE ***I added a picture with notes.We had the camper out for 5 days and the spring worked great.

I think I will leave it as-is and keep the second spring as a backup. Was concerned the door would slam based upon the other reviews so just mounted the one spring.  If you open the door all the way, i.e., right up to the outside wall it won't pull it shut unless you give it a little nudge back but opening halfway it gently closes the door.  Installation was straightforward and easy and I am not particularly a good instruction interpreter. Fits my 2002 Silverado LS 5.3L vortec RWD, extended cab.

I would install this on your Jeep as soon as you purchase the vehicle.  They're very easy to install and protect you from scratches that could lead to rust.  The guards fit perfectly on my 2011 Jeep Rubicon 2 door. Perfect fit for rear window on my 2004 Ford Excursion Limited. Easy to install. No spotting seen or squeaking at all They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. 
Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars Fits for my Honda 2005 Lx.Comes with instruction that have pictures.I have to write more to finish this review. Repeat Customer..... I use it for my 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 4.3 ltr. Manual WT truck 
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. 
Simple install, 2-wire hookup. Works as advertised. It can be installed at 2 different angles, gives an option for mounting. These supports seemed to be well made and direct OEM replacement.  The installation was very simple and only required a torx bit driver and a standard screw driver (to release the clip).  I would without hesitation purchase future StrongArm products. this product worked perfectly and made short work of removing and installing both inner tie rod ends on my 96 camry, easy to use, although it said not to use a impact gun with tool to remove tie rod end, i had limited space to turn the ratchet, so i used the impact gun. no damage to tool, highly recommend this product.

This is a must if you own the Hi-Lift jack.  This makes using the jack so much easier in many cicumstances.  I bought it to go along with my 48" Extreme model for my 2011 Polaris Ranger Crew and unfortunately 9I guess fortunately) I have not had the opportinuty to use this attachment on my own rig but have already had the chance to use it to help others!  I love it! I bought this to change the front and rear differential in my 2006 Toyota Tacoma.  It was a much better deal to buy in bulk.  Save yourself some money and do this simple maintanece.  I went in with a friend on this pack and we both saved a ton by doing it ourselves.  Also be sure to buy a pump to easily fill the differentials.  A cheap handpump is all you need. Good fit, be sure to measure your tires for fit. It was a good look in replacement of my old discolored cove. I keep the old one in RV to lay on when I need it. The price is very good. Thanks Folks 
works well Though Amazon stated this cap would not fit my 2013 Ford E-450 chassis (for a Jayco, Class C, Greyhawk, RV), I ordered it anyway as it fits many other years of Ford trucks and looks the same. It is rare for the same vehcle to change a design like that. It, in fact, fits perfectly. Our RV gas filler has no cover (not that that is a deterrant) and 60 gallons is a target for remote theft of gas, or a target for vandalism. This cap fits well. I have not been able to fit the stock cap-retainer onto it yet. I understand these modern vehicles have anti siphon plugs but one can still end up with foreign substances in the exposed fill-tube. This is a good 'ounce of prevention'.Highly recommended. Very well constructed but it has a design flaw that makes it useless. The internal plunger has a disc with a slot and the T handle needs to engage the disc perfectly or the rod pushes into the grease and not the disc so the grease does not load properly. I have 4 other standard grease guns and these work perfectly but I wanted the pistol grip so I could pump with one hand.I have not idea what the intended purpose is in having the rod disengage from the plunger disc as this is unique in my experience to the Lincoln grease gun. 
This product has to be the best in my opinion, it works on plastics to bring that almost new look back, when car was purchased. Iove this product and will probably purchase again when I run out. Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars Great replacement and works well.  I will buy another to have a spare for my 36 year old Ford RV 
a regular 32mm socket will not fit in the space of my equinox. this is a kind of shorter 32mm socket designed only for oil filter cap job. it works fine. Works great for lubricating spark plug and coil boots to allow them to easily slide on and off without damaging the spark plug wire. Just use a little bit in the end of the boot. It will not impeded the flow of current to the spark plug or coil. I have been using this for years on every type of ignition system including lawn mowers and race engines. Works great, nice to have a second cable, but the OBD end of the cable is angled.  In my case, this cable won't work on my Subaru Outback.  I would prefer the option of a straight OBD connector.  Note that the angle connector works on my other four cars (Mazda, Honda, Dodge). 
Perfect for exhaust work.  I bought it for a catalytic converter and o2 sensor project because it is rated for: -30F to 1800F I purchased this fluid to use in a GM manual gearbox. Overall al I would say I am pretty happy with it. Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!! 
This little guy is a must have. I used it to force out my old brake fluid when I changed my brakes. Worked like a charm. Filter looks to be of good quality and the fit was perfect. Probably not the best birthday present (I sent several others as well)for my 23 year old daughter but she was able to install herself and now her A/C blows a lot more air out the vents. The old 70k mile filter was packed solid with dust , leaves and dirt. I should have had one of these long ago for my Harley and Diesel truck but was too tight to buy one. I did the old elbow grease job.I didn't think my battery powered drill would hold-up and I didn't wanna mess with a cord. The ball knocks the job out quick with my electric drill and when I get done with my Harley it gives me more time to ride and let momma luv on me from behind.The thing should last forever and the red makes it easy to spot by an old man.buy one or two and quit thinking stupid like I was. 
I always use Techron before every oil change on both my cars.  It keeps everything running smooth.  The six pack is a good deal. Fits perfectly, easy to install.  Anyone - including those with zero mechanical ability, can change this filter easily.  Anyone who would pay the massive amount the Audi dealer wants to change this filter is a complete fool. Fit my '09 Sentra 2.0 perfect, you can always count on Wix. I Routinely run them 10k each oil change. 
Works great, nice to have a second cable, but the OBD end of the cable is angled.  In my case, this cable won't work on my Subaru Outback.  I would prefer the option of a straight OBD connector.  Note that the angle connector works on my other four cars (Mazda, Honda, Dodge). The GM bumper connector has its own cap to keep the weather out, and so does this Adapter. But I really wouldn't leave this adapter plugged in all the time because the GM connector then is not sealed.This adapter fits well, with a locating keyway that fits the groove of the GM connector, aligning all the pins correctly. It's a tight fit so that it won't fall out in case the cable to your trailer has enough weight to tug on this adapter to any significant degree.I don't have any illumination problems so the LED functions are not fully tested.  Frankly, I do a walk-around after hooking up anyway, with marker lights and flashers on to check that everything works.  I presume the LEDs will tell me if there's an issue some day. 2013 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Sahara: Used this to extend a Bluetooth adapter to the glove box of my Jeep through the dash panels. Now my knee won't smash the Adapter and with the plug head being shorter I don't hit this either. Works just as I had planned. 
I just ordered a replacement unit for my old waterproof 800.My original charger was attached outside to a dock for keeping the boat battery topped off.  After SEVEN YEARS, (7), it finally died.I contacted the company re the warranty.  They charge you $9.00 to ship it back once you get it to them..  There are NO OTHER charges..  I doubt I'll ever need the warranty in either case... Customer service is extremely slow.  My product started failing to take a charge, we contacted the company in june - it took them 6 days to get back to me - plus i had to chase them down by voice after emailing their cs dept failed to get any response (per the website).  Then they promised to email the rma instructions -- which took several days -- but they sent the wrong ones (sent retailer instructions).... when i responded that the instructions made no sense - they finally sent the correct instructions.  while waiting for their emails my husband tested the adaptor w/ a multi meter to find out it was just the adaptor that was failed (and since they expected us to pay to ship the whole unit back we didn't want to pay to send back the whole thing) -- i requested if i could just send the adaptor -- (btw - their emails are also full of spelling errors and they could not get my name right),  it took THREE emails to explain to CS what an adaptor was... ! ... then 7 more for them to promise to send one...  that was july 7.  2 days ago i still had not received the adaptor - so emailed once again asking where it was... was told 'sorry it's being mailed today' .... this product is used the most during the summer for us - we use it camping and at the drive-in, picnics etc etc  -- and we have had no ability to use it (cause we cant charge it) for all summer... then after they promised to ship the part a month ago i find out today not only was it not shipped at all - it was sent snail mail today from California (across country to VA) after i asked them and 'reminded' them -- so the likelihood of us getting this time for our next use requirement (this weekend) is highly unlikely.finally - its sold as having a compressor capable of inflating truck tires -- it does not. it does not create enough pressure to inflate our 17" truck or rv tires..  (we had to buy another dedicated compressor for them)A company is only as good as its customer service - and they have failed at every point for theirs.  not to mention a simple power adaptor should last more than 6 months.  the item is useless if you can't charge it.  I cannot recommend this product. I preferr this over the other brands due to warranty. Battery Tender warranty a joke, They charge shipping and repair cost under their warranty. I replaced my Battery Tender w/ these. I have used this brand on my tractor and 4 wheelers. I am getting over 5 years of battery life on both w/ this. 
This is my first travel trailer and exposure to an electronic brake control.  The dealer installed an inexpensive reese controller but the slide movement was too sensitive.  I bought this and set it up.  I would recommend to anyone first setting up to have your trailer brakes adjusted, then follow the manual.  After adjustment of the brakes I only needed a boost to 2, down from 3 prior to the adjustment.The reason I chose 4 out of 5 stars is that I am not sure if I have this set up correctly or it is an anomaly.What I mean is that if I start out braking hard I can feel the trailer brakes kick in and get a good stop, but it is not immediate.  If I get off the brakes and coast for 5+ seconds and brake again it can be a bit sensitive and be too much and can jerk the TV around.  if I gradually stop I do not feel the brakes as much.  I do realize that the faster I travel the more boost I need.  My trailer is 146% heavier than the tow vehicle.  It seems that my initial braking sets the sensitivity.  As I slow down for city traffic or campground speeds I only need boost 1. I don't know why I did not get this sooner but it works very well in filling the fresh water tank in my fifth wheel trailer.. the shut off valve is nice to have at the nozzle so I can easily shut it off the moment I hear that it is full.. I orig purchased this for use on my Honda cruiser, which didn't work well with the the Kuryakyn gripsKuryakyn 6340 Black Universal ISO-Grip for 1" Handlebarwhich didn't work due to the cramp buster tightening the rubber and making it over grip the throttle sleeve. It would not decelerate as soon as I would let off the throttle.I have recently added a sportbike to the stable and it is REALLY nice having it now.There is a comment about getting it in the right spot, and understanding that was is positioned correctly at 60mph may interfere with accessing the brake lever when you let off the throttle. This is something you should consider before using on a cruiser. On the sportbike I have no issues once so ever. It is nice as I can keep throttle applied without any fingers touching the throttle itself, using just my palm to keep pressure on the CrampbBuster.So it is REALLY nice to have, I still wish I had a throttle lock. But, it does help and is 4 star worthy. But at 8 bucks I'm going to give it 5 stars, I honestly can't expect an 8 dollar product to provide the same comfort as a 60 dollar one. 
This was a fraction of the price of the ones at the store and fit perfectly for my 2004 Lexus RX 330 AWD. Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. Great Fit 
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. It a belt... it fits, it hold and it rotates. There is no noise coming from it.Happy with the fit and performance. They only fit around a standard thickness roll bar not the newer jeep arrangement with the plastic cover shroud of the late models. 
these work great and are easy to put on and take off; I had to modify the lower clip to conform to the mirror on a F-150 but it was easy and I recommend these mirrows to anyone who has a pair of pliers and a little do-it-yourself tallent for the F-150 2012 model I don't need to do a long review to convey the basics that this pin works perfectly to secure your hitch to the receiver.  There's a little anodized flare, and a decent little rubber cap to keep the grit out of the lock mechanism and it's stainless steel to boot!  Nice quality item. Get these and stop bonkin the noggin. I used a stepladder to hold the liftgate while making the swap. It's a real mouse trap otherwise. These supports are exact replacement, fit perfect. If you lift the gate fully by hand you don't have to fight to make these things go on there. Simple, easy swap. 
Works great, nice to have a second cable, but the OBD end of the cable is angled.  In my case, this cable won't work on my Subaru Outback.  I would prefer the option of a straight OBD connector.  Note that the angle connector works on my other four cars (Mazda, Honda, Dodge). This goes into differentials in my trucks, 4X4s, and cars.  I've run Lucas in my Ford Explorer, Ford Mustang, Ford F-150, and Jeep Wrangler.  Formulated for limited slip and posi, no need for additional friction modifier.  Holds up to the rigors of four wheeling, boat hauling, and the track.Differentials are more or less the same, and have been for decades.  What you have is a box full of gears that delivers the power from the driveshaft to the axle.  Nothing complicated, right?  However, maintenance schedules will vary from one auto manufacturer to the other.  Some call for service every 12 months, and others tell you that the gear oil does not need to be changed at all.  I have personally seen fouled gear oil full of metal particles.  This is common in just about every car.  The gears will wear.  The only solution is to service the differential.  Fresh clean fluid can not hurt your car.The best thing that you can do is to upgrade to a differential cover with a magnetic dipstick, magnetic drain plug, and a fill hole.  Most after-market covers will also increase the fluid capacity and have cooling fins to keep the gears cooler.  While you have the cover off, now is a good time to inspect your ring & pinion gears for wear.  Then check your fluid regularly, and change as needed.Lucas Oil is on par with Mobil 1, Red Line, Royal Purple, Amsoil, and any other high grade synthetic on the market today. The P3 arrived exactly as described but my order was "lost" for 6 days between the printing of the shipping label and pick up by the P.O. No explaination was given when I contacted the company. Other than that I'm very satisfied with both the P3's function and performance. My only problem was mounting the unit in my 2012 Tundra. The plug in adaptor which I also purchased, mated up perfectly with the pre wired harness, included with Toyota's optional "tow package". Older Tundras and some of the 2012 models came with a pre wired harness about 1 foot long, but my 2012 was delivered with the new and improved shorter version, (something to do with safety) and is only about 3 inches long. The longer harness, coupled with the plug in adaptor, allowed mounting the P3 to the right side of the steering wheel by the center console, out of the way. Unfortunately, some later model Tundras, like mine, have the 3" pre wire harness, which restricts mounting the P3 just to the right of the hood release and directly above the emergency brake pedal. If I'm not extreemly careful, with my size 13 shoe, I inadvertently step on the face of the P3 when applying the emergency brake. If you leave the 2 mounting screws a little loose you can tilt the P3 up which gives you a little more clearance between the E brake and the P3 and all is good.. 
Perfect for exhaust work.  I bought it for a catalytic converter and o2 sensor project because it is rated for: -30F to 1800F Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!! Even though Amazon says it does not fit my truck; it does fit my 2002 Chevrolet 2500HD crew cab with 6.0L gas engine. I replaced both sensors and harness. Both sensors were rough looking and the rear sensor had standing water on it. It was a little bit of a chore to get to them because you have to remove the intake but it was not too bad. 
I bought this, set the code by turning the screw inside the front of the unit, and sprayed with a silicone lubricant.After a month on the front bumper, in the WA rain, there's no sign of rust and the inside tray is dry.The thumb-wheels turn easily and front face plate is tight.I can't find fault with this and it seems pretty secure.Since I can't predict when and where I might lock myself out of the truck, I just leave this on the front receiver by CURT where it fit's just fine with the smallest gasket.I'm very happy with this purchase. I bought it mainly to hold all the bolts, nuts, sockets that I lay around whenever I'm working on a car. Its magnets are very strong in holding the tray down and whatever metal parts you put on top it.Keep say much else about it as it does what it's suppose to do very well. I'll start by saying that this does a good job of keeping your face warm.  However, even a relatively small pair of glasses like what I'm wearing (Oakley &#34;drill bit&#34;) are somewhat too large for these.  I cu the nose hole out to about twice as large as it originally was, and cut a bit out of the hole around the eyes to clear the ear pieces, but it is seemingly impossible to get the mask close enough to my face so that my breath all goes through the mouth and nose hole instead of coming up through the eye parts and fogging my glasses up immediately.  My modifications do make it at least work indoors where it isn't cold (out of the box, it would fog up inside, too), but I didn't get this for playing dress-up inside.  But not everyone wears glasses, so I assume this probably works fine for those people. 
I purchased this belt for my 2003 Chevy Tahoe. I had no idea Chevy would put 2 serpentines on a newer generation vehicle. This smaller belt fits the A/C system only. It works like a champ and fits perfectly. I would recommend the Gatorback belts to EVERYONE! As an installation side note, you have to remove the air intake and larger serpentine to get to this "bottom of the motor" mounted unit.... way to engineer that one GM! I bought this belt for my 2003 Chevy Tahoe with the 5.3L engine and 145A Alternator. Make sure you know which alternator you have BEFORE purchasing this belt. The 105A alternators use a slightly shorter belt. It fits perfectly, doesn't make any noise and works great! You will also need the smallerGoodyear 4040377 Gatorback Poly V-Beltfor the A/C system on these vehicles.My 145 Amp Alternator has a 145A stamped on the side, visible from the drivers side. You could also look for the old belt part number on the existing belt and order accordingly. Perfect for exhaust work.  I bought it for a catalytic converter and o2 sensor project because it is rated for: -30F to 1800F 
This is a solid, versatile lock that will fit Class II, Class III and Class IV hitch receivers.  Mine came with two hardened-steel chrome plated pins (not a sleeve as was illustrated when I bought it).  The smaller pin works with Class II and Class III hitch receivers.  The larger pin works with Class IV.  I use this lock to secure my bike rack and it's tough enough that I wouldn't want to lose my keys.  The keyhole is protected by a weather-resistant rubber cover, yet rotates for easy accessibility.  This is a rugged, versatile hitch lock offered at a good price. Very well made unit, fits my Ford F150 and my Ram 2500 , Grease the snot out of it inside and out and install. The cover is a bit cheap but seems to work well. Double Double Check that you have the locking end on correctly, Just play with it before use and you will master it. I put these in my '03 TJ Jeep Wrangler.  They fit perfect and work exactly as you'd expect they should.  I installed a set of 55w HIDs in them and the light output is tremendous. 
Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.  The pickle fork is the last resort for me, as it will damage the balljoint boot.I prefer to use the Snap On balljoint remover.  If that one cannot fit, then I will try this tool.  If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork. Fits great, and I love that i don't have to have the key in it to make it lock. I have to do that with the Master coupler and hitch lock that i use when transporting. The great thing about a Hi-Lift jack is that it will last longer than you. However, at some point you're going to need to replace the climbing pins. If I were buying these separately at the hardware store, I be out $6 tops. Oh well, they work and that's what counts! 
Just as it says.  Easy to install, is good quality and functions just as it should.  To install, all that has to be done is to remove the four screws holding the fuel filler area finish ring in place.  The ring does not have to be removed.  Place the cover in place and use the provided screws to secure the cover.  That easy! I've gotten a few sets of these (4) to cover the heads of my front and rear license plate bolts and I've had mostly good results from these covers. I reviewed a separate kit that came with the bolts and threaded plastic mounts for your bumper but that did not directly talk about the covers (I think, who can remember?). These covers and the clear plastic rings which allow the caps to be held in place are easy to install with the single exception that the holes in the clear plastic rings are almost always a little larger that the diameter of the bolts holding your plate in place. This creates the small problem of a chance to accidently crush the top of the ring as you re-tighten each bolt because the ring will sit low on the bolt threads causing the outer portion of the ring (which allows the cap to &#34;snap&#34; and be held in place) so that it falls under the back of the bolt head. So you'll need to slip the ring over the bolt head and you get near the end of tightening down the bolt. The only other problem I've had with these caps is that one cap in one set (new) split as I was snapping it onto the clear plastic ring. I had extras form an old set so no big deal. I never &#34;lost&#34; one of these caps from it popping off during driving so they're a great cover and they do come in multiple colors depending on what you're looking for. I recommend this product. OEM quality, as mentioned, made in Japan.  The only gripe is the OEM cap has Honda screws that are have washer locks on them to keep them on the cap and thus less likely to drop while removing them.  The replacement screws are separate.  The cap also comes with a replacement gasket.TIP:  Always replace plug wires one at a time from the old cap to the new cap in the same order/rotation you pull from.May as well replace the rotor and coil while you are at it:Beck Arnley  173-7988  Ignition RotorOEM 5100A Ignition Coil 
Very good! if you don't have one and you are thinking of getting one, just get it! I had a chance to use this after about 1 week of getting it, so that was fun.  I was helping a stranded motorist get his stalled car towed into a lot, and at first I fumbled with it, getting the cinch bone positioned properly and just making sure it was going to stay put.It did work though, and it kept me from getting any nasty knots or anything tying it up (I just have one of these...on the other end I ran the whole tow cable through the loop to keep it cinched, but obviously that only works on one end).I might get another just to make it even easier to cinch both ends, but one worked fine for me so I'll probably stick with that. A neat little towel to get the last drop of water without wringing out the towel. I think you should get one. 
This is an OEM product for many Japanese vehicles.  Great price.  As a dealer, I can buy at a good price from the auto supply, this is a better price. I bought this for my 97 f150 and was very surprised at the cheap price for a quality price. very impressed! This is a great price for the cover and the filter.I paid less than $9 for both and they are OEM replacement parts.Great deal 
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods.

They are as described. I removed the double sided tape because I wanted to use a flexible silicone along with the screws to permanently mount these to my travel trailer. Now I no longer need to get out my 4ft level when I arrive at the camp site. I have found few RV camp sites to be level. I have also tried to level my travel trailer by eyeballing the way it looks when I park it. That never works out well. I always feel like the trailer is leaning when I walk around in it.With this bullseye level, I can place it on the trailer tongue or on the trailer floor as I do my leveling. I can quickly do the leveling with confidence. When I am done, I slip the bullseye in a drawer where it will be safe for my next trek. This hitch extension is &#34;adjustable&#34; because it has two holes on the &#34;male&#34; end of the receiver, and two holes on the &#34;female&#34; end.  Depending on how you insert this extension into your vehicle (hole one or two), and how you insert your bike rack or whatever else into the &#34;female&#34; end (hole one or two), there is some adjustment on how much extension you achieve.  In theory.I was hoping to use the SMALLEST amount of extension with this so that I'd achieve about 7&#34; of extension.  I needed to extend my Thule T2 bike rack just enough to clear a larger-than-factory Jeep tire.i am able to use the hole that positions this extension furthest into my Jeep (so the &#34;male&#34; of this extension is adjustable).  Unfortunately, I was not able to utilize the deepest hole in the &#34;female&#34; end of this extension because there is only about 2&#34; of space between that deeper hole and an internal ridge where the inside square bar is welded to the outside square bar.  Hard to describe, but essentially my Thule bike rack it the back of this extension before the holes lined up with the deepest hole in this extension.So.. I suppose you could blame that on my bike rack?  In hind sight though, I wouldn't trust any bike rack that only had that little amount of metal behind the holes--just not enough there to handle the load.  No.. I think that this extension could have been better designed to just have ONE hole on the &#34;female&#34; end, but position it somewhat in-between the two that it currently has.  I doubt that there are many racks out there that could utilize the deepest hole in this extension's &#34;female&#34; side...One additional comment.. I read some reviews that criticized the welds.  I am not a welder, but in my observation, the welds seem smooth and uniform all the way around this.  I must say that the metal is a little thin compared to other extensions that I've seen.  I think it's quite fine for any 2-bike rack out there, and I'm using it for that.  When I set up to carry 4-bikes, I do worry that this may snap though, and I am pursuing another extension for that reason.Conclusion:  If you are only carrying 2 bikes, and you are happy with the extension possibilities IGNORING the deepest hole in the &#34;female&#34; part of this extension, I recommend it.  The price is reasonable and the integrated locking bolt is really nice (especially if you buy their optional locking bolt.)If you want a very short extension, this probably won't work.If you plan to carry 4 bikes, I don't know if this is strong enough.  I'm using it for that occasionally, but I'm a little worried about it... 
These supports seemed to be well made and direct OEM replacement.  The installation was very simple and only required a torx bit driver and a standard screw driver (to release the clip).  I would without hesitation purchase future StrongArm products. Installed on a 2006 Acura MDX and it was painless... worst part of the install was getting out the interior panel holders as I did not have the proper tool. I installed this as an addition to a Python 991 system.  The sensor was simple to install and the color-coded wires and instructions were clear.  For the price, this is a lot of additional protection for the money. 
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors.

This is a product is made of high quality fasteners and nuts and includes the hex key wrench for installation. Great valuie. I bought this because Amazon suggested that it should be bought along with the brake controller. There is no need for it at all as the brake controller mounted just fine with the included hardware. Bottle came as described, have not had to use it, but it comes with the TPMS safe sealant in most flat kits.

Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. These will not fit a 2014 Jeep Sahara Unlimited just in case anybody wanted to know.If by chance if you have a 2014 JKU you need a an oil filter. That number is a MOPAR 349.Our local Napa store could not bring up a part number for a new Jeep? 
Fits a little tight especially around the front fender and floorboards but it works.  I have a 03' Shadow ACE 750cc.  After a couple rain storms I can report my bike stayed dry (except a portion of the front wheel) and through heavy winds, the motorcycle cover stayed put.  What&#8217;s nice about this cover is the price and how it has elastic hooks to secure the cover in place.  If you decide to buy a cover and your bike has a windshield, floor boards and aftermarket mirrors I recommend you buy a 2XL (if your bike is similar in size to a Shadow 750cc).  Look at the picture I posted, mine has stock mirrors and no windshield and fits VERY tight.  My mirrors shift out of place when the cover is on.  Before each ride I have to adjust them cause the cover is soo tight.  Also, if you have floor boards that&#8217;ll make the fit even more tighter.  Buying one size bigger and I would say you bike will be 100% covered. Although they fit my Honda Odyssey, these jumbo shades aren't as big as myBasix Magic Shade Super Jumbo Sunshade.  I have to put them in "portrait position," compared to the others, which fit in "landscape position."  The Altus shades are vinyl, not metallic, so they don't cool the car as well.  However, they do appear to be more durable.Folding is not difficult but I know it frustrates some people, like my husband and my in-laws.  There's a knack to it, but it's a very quick motion once learned.  I like it much better than accordion style shades. Great for bikes. Not for cars. It doesn't hold much, but it's low enough and it's designed to have the capture cone on the corner, so you can fit it for bikes.Other than that, I can't imagine having this tiny thing for car oils. It works for both my bike and my car, because my car is tiny 4 banger and it doesn't hold too much oil. 
I was asked to rewrite my review for some strange reason. I can only assume it was because the person approving my review didn't understand the product or the review.&#34;These work great for the backseat riders. It assists them in climbing up into my 2012 Wrangler. Arrived on time and adequately packaged.&#34;This review is for Rear Seat Grab Handles... their purpose is to give the backseat passengers something to &#34;grab&#34; onto. They are made for Jeep Wranglers. They fit the headrests of a 2012 Jeep Wrangler based on my personal experience with MY 2012 Jeep Wrangler. They arrived on time and weren't all jacked-up, so I can only assume that the packaging was adequate. Just installed the lock on my trailer nose mounted spare tire. After installing, it obviously works as described in the ad description. So far, I am satisfied with the item. I like them - YES the KC is bigger now than it was on older models of the guards IT IS AS SHOWN IN THE PICTURE and  I LIKE IT.They provide some protection - not a lot  but they do look good.I actually saw another set of these today on a Toyota FJ and thought how good they looked on the black lights they had. Then I saw a CJ with the old style ( there were aged ) the KC was smaller and the guards were holding up well after the years of use it was obvious they had. 
Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlander Works great.

Amazon fit checks show that it would fit 1996 Lexus LS400. I ordered and found out it didn't fit. My car has an arm that requires the thin side but this wiper blade is too big to fit.

bought this for my 2004 honda crv.  fit perfectly and cleared the code.  easy to do just give the threads some wd40 This fits not only the Ecotec, but newer VW TDI's with the canister filter.  Works great, relatively low profile and goes nicely on a 3/8&#34; drive.  I accidentally ordered three (fat fingered the cart), and sold one to a fellow VW driver and one to a guy with a GM. It fits perfectly to my 2005 Honda Accord.Filter quality seems to be good.

wife loves it and will be used in the car. I hope it holds up over time.  will give further feedback Will work great for what I bought it for.Haven't used it yet and will post if it turns out to be a pos. they do their job but they dont seem like they will last, just over the last bit of summer these pads started showing signs of stress and bending, no cracks yet but i dont think they will make it through next summer. 
Great product and low price. For use in all gas engines. East to measure and pour. I recommend, will buy again, and I hope this helps someone. Recently purchased an USB Oscilloscope for use in my projects.  This set of test leads is worth it's cost from Amazon. I do recommend this kit. I needed to replace a defective gas cap for my 2005 Corvette due to a known defect with the original caps in this model year.  I did some checking on the web, and Amazon had this AC Delco part at about half the price I could find elsewhere.  Installed it upon receipt and it works perfectly.  Part works exactly as I expected and I recommend it to others who need a replacement for their Corvette gas caps. 
After Toyota TRD stopped importing their top of the line filters to the US 5 years ago, I switched to K&N HP1002 for my Toyota 4Runner, Toyota T100 and it also fits my Suzuki Grand Vitara.  Makes for a much easier removal than trying to use a filter wrench ... esp. on the Suzuki where there is absolutely no room to work (and the filter is sideways - who thought of that crummy idea?). Even though Amazon says it does not fit my truck; it does fit my 2002 Chevrolet 2500HD crew cab with 6.0L gas engine. I replaced both sensors and harness. Both sensors were rough looking and the rear sensor had standing water on it. It was a little bit of a chore to get to them because you have to remove the intake but it was not too bad. I bought this filter for my 2007 Kawasaki Vulcan 900 Classic. This is a high quality filter that fit perfectly with no issues. The bolt head welded to the top of the filter is a awesome little touch! Thanks K&N. 
Be sure to check with the Auto or Truck Manufacturer to find the correct SIZE of Oil Filter for your vehicle. Amazon's Parts Locator says that the Motorcraft  FL820S does not fit my 1995 Mercury Grand Marquis, 4.6 Litre V-8 engine. This is incorrect.

Very high quality socket, which is expected from Lisle. Get the thread chaser from Lisle as well to be sure of a clean thread before installing the the new O2 sensor. Both the socket and thread chaser are offered on Amazon at a very good price. 
Works as advertised. Very easy to manipulate to get to the valve stem to check pressure on my motorcycle. It should since that is what is was made for. Just make sure it has a sure footing when placing it, and works just fine, to insure all trailer appliances will work as expected and needed the Viair 00073 70P Heavy Duty Portable Compressor works great, is small and quiet.  I am still lookign for the right adapter so i can plug into 110V plug and the one i purchased with this did not work. 
I welded a piece of flat stock on the insert for the motorhome. This adapter is for my Dodge Grand Caravan. This fit all four O2 sensors on my 2002 Toyota Tundra and I could have not completed the job without this specialized socket. This O2 sensor was a direct replacement for the original part.  Wire was the correct length and wires/plug matched original perfectly.  Easy install and I have seen a few MPG increase in fuel economy since installation.  The replacement of these sensors will also help ensure longer catalytic converter life.  Very happy with this purchase. 
Fair price and does what it's supposed to do. It's handy for when you don't want to work directly at the car. Works great but make noise which is to be expected because the way it is designed to work. Does exactly what it's supposed to do,fit low and snug on the filter cover. To work with good tools can make the task a miserable experience or a sense of accomplishment.Recommended for sure!

I am reading lots of bad reviews on these pigtails.  What worries me the most is some seem to be shipping with a different thread type and people are stripping them trying to make them work.  Why the heck can't these be standardized?  I've also read that some come with different sizes of NPT as well as different thread types.  It seems that what is listed is not always what you order, and on top of that, someone like me, who does not know how to recognize the different thread types and sizes won't even know if I received the correct part or the wrong part.I recommend you double check your part number on the hose before installing them to avoid stripping your regulator.I thought, why not use quick connect hoses to connect my regulator to my appliance.  It seems these mate up nice to other quick connects--but only if made by CAMCO, and then these quick connect fittings don't mate up easily to the other parts like regulators etc.  WTF?  I need still another adapter?  And some people tell me perhaps multiple adapters to make it all work?  I'm not going to use three different adapters to mate up a quick connect.  That means I have a huge lunking thing sticking out ready to be damaged, knocked out of place, that is sure to leak out all my expensive propane.Ok, so I called CAMCO.  I wanted to be sure I ordered the right part and spoke to two different people at CAMCO that blew me off.  It seems Camco parts don't necessarily fit each other.  And they don't sell adapters to make them fit. It would be great if they could provide some customer support and perhaps make up some custom hoses to help people make things work.I give this a 1 star because CAMCO's huge fail in helping me put together a system that will allow me to hook up external tanks to my RV.One star also, because they ship different types of hose fittings and buyers don't know what they are getting.Honestly, I'd like to order one of every one of their parts and analyze them.  I'm an engineer, and if I can't figure out what to order, based on conflicting information--reviews that report receiving different size fittings 1/4&#34; npt than specified 3/8&#34; npt, and a multitude of part numbers--and a need for adapters when a buyer should be able to buy everything he or she needs without an adapter---it all tells me CAMCO has not thought out how their products are used.Think about it, there are only so many way propane tanks, hoses and appliances are hooked up. I don't see any need for adapter other than those that attach to the tanks. IT WORKSI NEEDED ONEIT WAS CHEAPIT DID THE JOBI MAY NEVER NEED IT AGAIN AS I MYSELF DON'T FORCE DOUBLE THREADED THINGS BUT OTHERS ARE APPARENTLY NOT SO INTELLIGENT.$400 STIHL CONCRETE SAW IS BACK ON THE JOBI WIN ANOTHER ONE.I WILL PROBABLY LOOSE IT DUE TO PREDATION ETC BEFORE I NEED IT AGAIN BUT UNTIL THEN I CAN CORRECT ANY CARELESS PLUG SCREWING THAT MAY COME MY WAY. This is the OEM cabin air filter for the 2006 Acura TL, and trust me: this thing does what it's supposed to do. I couldn't believe how much crud this thing had caught between the B12 service on my girlfriend's 2006 TL.One thing I will say is that this is a PITA to replace. After disconnecting the glove compartment door and removing the two screws and push fittings securing the assembly to the console, pull the console down. Directly down. That means sit in the passenger seat and apply equal force to both sides of the assembly... or you'll break a tab and your interior will never be the same. I've seen two people make the mistake of busting the tabs loose right to left. Don't be another. 
I bought this for my 99 ford escort lx sedan, so I could hear my sony stereo more. I followed the instructions and applied the product to my front doors. I have noticed a difference in the sound quality of my speakers. I can hear them more and there's less vibration on the doors. As far as road noise goes, it helped just a little. This product isn't made to reduce the road noise, just to help get rid of vibrations and make your stereo system louder and easier to hear on the road. The road noise level is still the same in my car. I bought about 10 boxs for my PT. The top of my PT would make a flutering sound when driving, not no more. Also road sounds dimed down some. When it rains, the top of my PT doesn't sound like a tin can anymore.... GLAD  I  WENT  WITH  THE  CHROME AND  NOT  THE BLACK ONE, I  HOOKED  THIS ONE UP TO  MY GV1400 MOTORCYCLE IF  YOU  HAVE JUST  A  LITTLE  KNOW  HOW YOU CAN  DO  IT YOUR SELF , ALL  YOU WILL NEED TO GO WITH THIS IS A RELAY THAT DOES NOT COME WITH IT. YOU  CAN  GET IT ON HERE OR ANY PART STORE, I  HAVE MADE MANY PEOPLE JUMP  DUE  TO THE SOUND OF  THE  HORNS  LOUDNESS. 
These bulbs work as described. The 4000Ks illuminate clear white for those who want no yellow or blue hues. They are definitely brighter than standard bulbs, but keep in mind nothing will emulate HID brightness. These bulbs are fantastic! They aren't "blue" at all. Instead they are pure white. If you look at the bulbs when they're turned on, they give a tiny hint of blue, but the light they emit is completely pure white. They light up the road VERY well and reflect much better off objects than my previous stock halogens. A VERY good buy!! First, as with all of the Dupli-Color Metalcast paints, if you want the metalcast effect, you'll have to use the Dupli-Color Metalcast Ground Coat (MC100) on the surface before you apply the color or it will not come out right. The can says that it also comes out the same if you're painting directly onto chrome like surface but I have not tried this so I don't know. Now for this green. I'm more of a blue and purple guy for dark colors so only by my personal preference do I say that this green comes out just a tad light in color for me. Overall though, if you use the ground coat this comes out great with a nice metal sheen. I recommend this product. 
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. Great Fit

Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars Works great.

32mm is the correct size for my Jetta TDI oil cap, and this fits perfectly.It's also fairly low profile, another plus. Purolater PureONE oil filters consistently rate as one of the industry's highest quality filters.  I use the PL20195 on my Cub Cadet GT-2544 as a direct-fit larger capacity filter.  These are priced competitively and you can't beat &#34;Prime&#34; shipping! would recommend getting a  size  smaller than  what the  &#34;sizing chart&#34; recommends  as  I  measure aroun my leg  as  recommended  and  the chaps  were  one size too large.. otherwise they are  awesome  quality and build 
It is clear and the flip thing works fine.  It fit my stock mount on my windshield perfectly.  It does come with a mount for you to use, just no glue.  But, as I said, it fit my old one with no problems at all. I'm using these in my 2009 Civic sedan and have not had any problems. Fits like a glove and build is solid. Can't complain; it works perfectly and as advertised however, i should have done my homework.  it doesn't fit my rear disk... it only fits the front. 
I use these in the home garage and am not a master mechanic.  This feeler gauge set is great buy.  The feelers are clearly laser marked in both in and mm.  There is a great variety to create any thickness you want to gauge.  They easily come apart to create a gauge or rearrange your most used to the top.  These were the same OEM brand offered at my local Autozone for half the price. These MicroFiber cloths work great!  When it comes to Microfiber cloths, don't skimp out on brand/price. The cheaper ones break apart easily, nor are they as absorbent. This is a review of both the driver's side wiper (21 inches) and passenger side wiper (18 inches).New windshield wipers are like new sneakers: the old ones may still be fine, but the new ones make you feel like you can fly. Same with these ANCO C-21-UB and C-18-UB Wiper Blades. My old wipers weren't crying out to be replaced, but these new ones have passed with flying colors and no streaking. We've had rain about 80 percent of the time since I received these, so at least as new wipers they're more than passable, they're nice.Our car has the "hook" type connectors for which these are primarily designed. I had more of a problem taking the old wipers off than the 2 seconds it took me to "click" these on.5 out of 5 stars for nice, quiet, no streaks, and easy installation. I recommend these with no qualms.

Exact replacement from OEM. Exact fit worked perfect . Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs. Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. Great Fit 
These lights are very bright and have a excellent warranty. They work great on the A post of jeep wranglers. They are very easy to install great directions and guides. These are very good off road  light. Not much to say, they are what they are, and at a great price! These are high quality, and I only use the best in my 2003 Subaru Impreza WRX Sport Wagon. ^^ The Anco C20-UB Contour wiper blade fit perfect in my husband's 2001 Dodge Ram PU truck. It also looks a thousand times better. It performs really good from the get go. The contour hugs the windshield nicely without streaking, smearing, or skipping.For the price, these blades are so much nice looking and better performing than the cheap stock blades. 
These item does fit perfect on my 2004 BMW x3. does what its suppose to do. so far so good thanks They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Fit my '98 Nissan Frontier's oil pan perfectly. Looks to be of nice quality.  Torque to 25ft/lbs (on the Frontier anyway) 
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. This was a fraction of the price of the ones at the store and fit perfectly for my 2004 Lexus RX 330 AWD. This is a very solid product.  I had purchased another brand that claimed to be 'universal' but it did not fit the larger Airstream coupler.  The product fit although I did have to turn it backward (key hole facing the trailer). 
Fit my '98 Nissan Frontier's oil pan perfectly. Looks to be of nice quality.  Torque to 25ft/lbs (on the Frontier anyway) They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Even though Amazon says it does not fit my truck; it does fit my 2002 Chevrolet 2500HD crew cab with 6.0L gas engine. I replaced both sensors and harness. Both sensors were rough looking and the rear sensor had standing water on it. It was a little bit of a chore to get to them because you have to remove the intake but it was not too bad. 
I drive a car that has dead spots on both sides.  This fits the bill as it provides a larger area of view.  You need to look more carefully as all these types of mirrors make the car in view seem a lot further away so use as a reference.  Since these mirrors are fairly small they only use up about 20% of the existing rear view mirrors viewing area.  I only use these on my rear view mirrors as that is when the blind viewing areas occur.  I usually purchase a few different types of these mirrors so I can determine which works best for me and my wife.  Also try on different spots of the existing mirror, before removing the adhesive covering, to determine the best location.  If you attach it in the wrong location these mirrors can be removed by using a one sides razor blade.  Just push down on the razor slowly to prevent the existing mirror from cracking.  Once off you can always purchase new double sided tape to reuse the convex mirror. I went through several different shades trying to find one that would fit a large windshield.  The Basic Jumbo shade fits the bill, plus it folds up nicely.  If you have a large truck, van, or other vehicle that has a large windshield, then this product will likely fulfill your needs.  Since this is actually two different pieces, you can place them horizonallty or vertically.  The only downside is that there is no opening for a mirror, but I find that these go over the mirror and are easily held up with the sunvisors.The material is thin, but appears to be very strong.  The shields fold up into a small circle (about 12" across) for storage.  Unfold slightly and they pop out into their full size and shape.  To fold them back, just bend in slightly and turn your wrists.  They bounce right back into the small circles. Fits a little tight especially around the front fender and floorboards but it works.  I have a 03' Shadow ACE 750cc.  After a couple rain storms I can report my bike stayed dry (except a portion of the front wheel) and through heavy winds, the motorcycle cover stayed put.  What&#8217;s nice about this cover is the price and how it has elastic hooks to secure the cover in place.  If you decide to buy a cover and your bike has a windshield, floor boards and aftermarket mirrors I recommend you buy a 2XL (if your bike is similar in size to a Shadow 750cc).  Look at the picture I posted, mine has stock mirrors and no windshield and fits VERY tight.  My mirrors shift out of place when the cover is on.  Before each ride I have to adjust them cause the cover is soo tight.  Also, if you have floor boards that&#8217;ll make the fit even more tighter.  Buying one size bigger and I would say you bike will be 100% covered. 
First, as with all of the Dupli-Color Metalcast paints, if you want the metalcast effect, you'll have to use the Dupli-Color Metalcast Ground Coat (MC100) on the surface before you apply the color or it will not come out right.

I'm more of a blue and purple guy for dark colors so only by my personal preference do I say that this green comes out just a tad light in color for me. Overall though, if you use the ground coat this comes out great with a nice metal sheen. I recommend this product. Returned found better kit with colors that help match RV. You need kit with colors to match most applications. This kit is great! The LEDs are very bright at night and all the colors look good.The music pulse feature is lacking but I didn't expect much from it. 
the ones I received are not identical to the picture.  one can only be installed on the side and the other can only be installed on the front (or back).  the markings are different for left to right level vs front to back level. The 2 x 2 Inch mirrors are a good fit for 2006 Honda Pilot. I had to order via Amazon since I couldn't find these anywhere - it appears local auto stores only carry the 3 x 3 inch size. These little blind spot mirrors are a must buy item - they cover the blind spots on either side of the vehicle very well. These mirrors are the best that I have found for towing a travel trailer.  They are easily installed and they do not vibrate at all.  The field of view is goodsnd When not towing a trailer, they are easily removed for storage. 
Great Fit Exactly what was offered, fit nicely, no major prep work, won't fade or crack, adjusts perfectly, easy removal and fits under seat in truck Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. 
Perfect fit for rear window on my 2004 Ford Excursion Limited. Easy to install.

Very quick and easy mounting and really adds to the look of the rear of the Jeep.  These are metal and not a cheap plastic and mount with included screws into the existing lens cover screw holes. It bothers me when front license plate is screwed directly to the bumper.  Considering the cost of these mounting brackets, I wish manufacturers included them as standard equipment; it would show their attention to detail.When I found Cruiser Accessories 79150 Mounting Plate it seemed like a good value.  I especially liked multiple slots for mounting onto the bumper.  These slots provide a good number of mounting and adjustment options.  I used the upper two vertical slots because they were spaced exactly like the existing holes in my car's front bumper.Unfortunately, there was a couple of frustrating issues that spoiled the experience:1.  Four screws that are included with the plate are too long.  I saw them being long and I am glad I checked for this before installing the mounting plate onto the front bumper.  I used included four screws to attach the license plate and the Black Cruiser Accessories 20050 Classic Lite frame to the mounting plate - screws' sharp tips protruded 1/4" from the back of the mounting plate.  If I had installed the mounting plate onto the bumper first and then tried to attach the license plate with the included screws, I would have damaged the front bumper in two places (the bottom two holes ended up over an air intake slot on my car).  I expect all pieces included with the product to be carefully engineered for that product and working properly.  These screws, obviously, are of the wrong size.  The fact that I had to go to Home Depot to find properly fitting screws not only was frustrating, but also increased the overall cost.2.  The thin pieces of plastic at the top and bottom of the mounting plate are too flimsy.  When I unpacked the plate, these areas of the mounting plate were slightly deformed: bent inwards. Fortunately, the license plate covered the problem.When the mounting plate is installed, it looks nice, so I am not completely disappointed; however, I found a similar product from Bell at Autozone, and it was cheaper (though Bell's mounting plate had very long screws too). This is a product is made of high quality fasteners and nuts and includes the hex key wrench for installation. Great valuie. 
The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around! Truly an impressive assembly of 4 parts. If there is a finer example of a little piece of rubbery roll-y wheel attached to a wooden handle with some metal parts in the middle tying it all together, show me. Very quick and easy mounting and really adds to the look of the rear of the Jeep.  These are metal and not a cheap plastic and mount with included screws into the existing lens cover screw holes. 
This fits not only the Ecotec, but newer VW TDI's with the canister filter.  Works great, relatively low profile and goes nicely on a 3/8&#34; drive.  I accidentally ordered three (fat fingered the cart), and sold one to a fellow VW driver and one to a guy with a GM. Inexpensive, yet works as good as the ones sold by Honda dealerships. Made true to specs and fits right into the slot on my Accord 2006.Will buy again. I was looking for this air filter on the K&N website and went to AutoZone priced at 50-60 bucks. I put in my car info said, doesn't fit. BUT, it DOES fit my 2004 Crown Victoria perfectly. 
I welded a piece of flat stock on the insert for the motorhome. This adapter is for my Dodge Grand Caravan. Easy to install. I used my own screws because of the material that I was mounting the bracket on. I had to tape one of the light adapter plugs as it was a loose fit in the bracket. Exact fit for Lexus RX300. As easy to install as I could've expected with all parts: the sensor, the cable and  the plug matching the original layout.

Works as needed, only problem is it will only fit a standard oil jug not the gallon. This pump works as advertised.  I needed it to transfer fluid to the rear differential of my Honda Element.  Screwed it into the quart bottle of fluid and pumped differential full......no muss no fuss! Plews Lub hand pump. Works just fine to refill Dual Pump Fluid in my Honda CRV. Must for service every 15,000 miles. 
This air gauge is dead on accurate, it seals completely, allows air to flow the way it should and the two headed chuck fit all cars, trucks and even those pesky hard to reach motorcycle valve stems. I own three motorcycles and there is nothing more aggravating than trying to fit a chuck in between rotors, fork tubes and tight spaces on a motorcycle. You know what I mean. This two headed angled chuck is angled perfectly to fit over a cycle stem without leaking or having to bend the valve stem. I love it. Used part of it on my 2012 VW Jetta Sportwagen TDI.  Great design - the twist shut off valve is a very practical feature.  Took off the very tip of the funnel (and put the rest aside) and attached it to a plastic hose that I had attached to a 2-gallon Home Depot pump sprayer.  Tip fit perfectly over the hole in the transmission filter housing and into the plastic hose.  Was able to pump in 6 liters in MUCH less time (and no mess) and use the &#34;snorkel&#34; or standpipe to drain off the excess, after running the DSG through the gears and getting temp up to about 40c.  Pumping in 6 liters dilutes and flushes out the dirty fluid caught up in the fluid cooler, the transmission body and the shifting channels.  Result:  a much better DSG service than the dealer provides. Did a great job putting the transmission fluid back into the Ford and Mercury sealed 5R55W trans. Just screw the pump into the qt. bottle trans. fluid and pump..

I ordered this to help make a better fit for the bike rack on the front of a Ford Expedition. I was specifically hunting for a fairly short extension because I wanted the bikes to stick out no further than necessary. The selection of holes in this extension allowed me to adjust the fit into the receiver, as well as the fit of the bike rack into the extension. This allowed me to fit the bikes about 2 inches closer to the vehicle than any other extension I was able to find. Very pleased with its performance. I have had it for a while now. I like it. There is a little space between the holder and the wall to which I have mounted it. Mounting is pretty easy as there is plenty of space to fit the screw driver. I would say that it holds 20 to 25 grocery bags. I purchased this belt for my 2003 Chevy Tahoe. I had no idea Chevy would put 2 serpentines on a newer generation vehicle. This smaller belt fits the A/C system only. It works like a champ and fits perfectly. I would recommend the Gatorback belts to EVERYONE! As an installation side note, you have to remove the air intake and larger serpentine to get to this "bottom of the motor" mounted unit.... way to engineer that one GM! 
They are levels for a camper  and in that respect they function well.  The fineness of the level's reading can mean little you don't take care during installation.  Jack it up or do whatever  you need to do to  level your camper.  I use a quality 2' or longer carpentry level  and  I use the inside floor to level from - width and length.  Jack the camper up or drive it up on blocks but get it as close to level as you can.  I install these levels on the rear in the center and right side  near center or forward.  They have sticky back tape on so they will hold in place but being never satisfied with sticky tape I screw them down. I have a 30' travel trailer.  It has built in jacks at the front and rear (4 total) along with the tongue jack but it still tends to bounce no matter how tight you get those jacks.Not a major problem, but a minor annoyanceSo I ordered these.  My camper has twin axles and the axles are square.  I put these under one of the axles and crank them up as tight as I can.  It removes 99% of the bounce in the camper.I recommend these to anyone that wants to use them for this purpose.  I suppose you could also use them at the front and back, if you don't have built in jacks. We bought and installed extras of these on our RV, just because the manufacturer never seems to put them in convenient places.  I want to pull into my site, and sit right in my seat at the leveling controls and do everything right there.  I installed extra level bubbles around the driver so all my rough leveling is done, and THEN I can walk around and fine-tune it at the back.My only warning to buyers:  make SURE you have them exactly where you want them before pressing on.  They DON'T move or come back off.  It's actually difficult to set them prefect on the first try because they stick so well.  Use a good carpenter's level to get the RV straight, then hold these steady with both hands and place CAREFULLY.  I'm kinda shaky so I really had to brace my hands on the RV while setting them. 
I have found few RV camp sites to be level. I have also tried to level my travel trailer by eyeballing the way it looks when I park it. That never works out well. I always feel like the trailer is leaning when I walk around in it.With this bullseye level, I can place it on the trailer tongue or on the trailer floor as I do my leveling. I can quickly do the leveling with confidence. When I am done, I slip the bullseye in a drawer where it will be safe for my next trek. I carry this little pack on motorcycle for emergencies.  I tested it out (needed to make sure it worked), and it filled up the tire fast.  It is well built, and honestly, is one of the most popular tire pumps for motorcycles.  It's small, but I'm not sure it would fit under your seat, depending on your motorcycle.  I ride an R1200RT, and I carry it in my tank bag.It gives you four choices for wiring.  I directly wired it into the battery, so I don't have to worry about it if I need it.It's compact.  It works.  It's powerful.  It's easy to use.  This is better than the CO2 cartridges by far.  It's a great product. I bought this to use with my camping trailer. I also use stabilizing jacks and wheel chocks, so the wheel dock really has no use. Seems like it would work well with a boat trailer. Price is good.

The &#34;feet&#34; on this bar slides off the truck bed sides and makes it worthless.When the ratchet is extended, the mechanism for that ends up out of arms reach when standing outside the truck. Great way to keep your tongue jack from resting on wet ground or concrete, likely extending the life by not letting it rust out so quick.  Using with a tow package that includes a weight distribution assembly can prove problematic for smaller SUV's/cars though (tested with a 2008 Ford Escape with Class 3 hitch), as the tongue jack stand is so tall that you have to sometimes jack up your car up to clear it!  Still, I can't fault the jack stand for that.  Highly recommended. 
With the fine threading it may be stronger but doubt that this feature will make a difference. The split washer is chrome plated which is a mistake as the chroming weakens the washer and a piece off the end cracked off when I first attached the ball to a hitch.The directions state that the nut should be torqued to 450 ft. lbs. which is likely to be an error. Hard to even find a torque wrench that goes up to 450 foot lbs. much less someone who could tighten the nut to that specification without a 4 foot cheater bar. This doesn't fit my 2007 Toyota Tacoma factory hitch.  It needs to be 2 7/8".  The package on this lock reads 2 5/8 but I measured it at 2 3/4.  I'm going to have to grind the bolt.Update, Jan 2014.  An noted I had to grind the inside ends to make this fit in my Tacoma OEM hitch.  Once, it was ground to the proper length, I spray-painted the bolt and have used it to haul a 19-foot trailer and attach my tow hook ever since with no further problems. I have two cars, both of which require the large #14 sheet metal self-tapping screws to mount the plate to the nylon retainers behind the plate (the ones mounted on the car that the screws screw into). Problem is that diameter of the plastic ring that holds the screw covers is too small to take the screw's large diameter head. The maximum screw head diameter that will fit the ring is .435 inch (11 millimeters). Option 1: Replace the nylon retainers on the car, but different cars have different retainers so one must search for new ones that will accept a #12 screw. Option 2: Try to find #14 self-tapping screws with smaller heads. I shopped around for #14 screws with smaller heads to no avail. Option 3: Grind down the screw head's diameter. Option 4 (not good): On one car I used #12 sheet metal screws that have a smaller diameter, but DO fit the rings, and wrapped the threads with tape. This sort of works, but I really can't tighten them down satisfactorily. So I have to check their security now and then. I'm leaving the other car as is for now. Maybe someone has more practical ideas? Sure would like to hear of them. BTW, SEE THE UPDATE BELOW.UPDATE 11/16/13:I think I've found a viable solution to the above problem. I used a #12 sheet metal self-tapping screw, placed a 1/2-inch long piece of ordinary shrink tubing (1/4" i.d.) over the threads towards the pointed end of the screw. Used a heat gun (or you can use a match, BIC lighter or soldering iron) to shrink the tubing which effectively increases the thread diameter to about that of a #14 screw. This allows me to tighten the screw securely and will last much longer than ordinary tape. One more thing: The THICKNESS of the screw head doesn't quite allow the chrome cap to fully snap into place over the nylon ring. The top of the head needs to be filed down a little leaving enough Philips "X" to use the screwdriver. 
Fabulous unit, compact, quiet, powerful, and not too heavy. I cut off the alligator clamps and wired it to a 7-way trailer connector so that I can plug it in to the rear of my truck. 12v is only present when the truck is running so this is a foolproof setup. I like the 100% duty cycle although I do not expect that to be an issue. the Viair 00073 70P Heavy Duty Portable Compressor works great, is small and quiet.  I am still lookign for the right adapter so i can plug into 110V plug and the one i purchased with this did not work. My son suggested I get the whole K&N system but I opted for the factory style replacement filter instead. O.K., I am cheap...lol.  I installed this in my 2010 f150 5.4 litre FX2. I keep the avg.mpg readout on in my dash. I average 17.4 and I don't drive it hard. After the filter, I average 18.1. I was shocked and I am very pleased with these results. 
This Master Lock trailer lock set provides a coupler lock, coupler latch lock, and a hitch pin lock, with the convenience that they are all keyed the same. We are using this set on my pop-up camper that spends a lot of time in storage, so wanted more that just the standard coupler lock.I like that there are two locks on the trailer that would have to be defeated, making my camper a harder target. Also, the hitch pin lock includes both a 1/2" and 5/8" pin, so it fits my current 1/2" hitch and I won't need to buy a new one if we upgrade in the future.This is a good quality set and I am comfortable that this will at least slow down all but the most skilled and determined would be thief.Highly Recommended!CFH This item is great if you have multiple adapters and need to use the cigarette for charging items for those in the back seat. I have two ports and the extension is used for one of them. Very clever idea. Had to use on my 2013 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Sahara with a lift kit and adjustable drop hitch. Spinning ball hitches for different sizes won't work in my case because the adjustable hitch height is a solid piece specific to the entire hitch. In order to tow my 2 different trailers I'd need 2 drop hitches. Interchangeable balls is the perfect solution and I have to say these are perfect. They work well and are rated around 8k pounds of towing. Saved a lot of money here compared to my closest towing accessory store. 
The install is easy, just level your camper using a carpenter level of 3 feet or longer.  Set the level from side-to-side on your smooth flooring or counter top. Then set the level from front-to-back the same way on the smooth flooring or counter top.  Now position the Hopkins 08525 levels, one on the side you prefer to work from at the front of the camper, on a flat vertical surface.  Do the same on a side wall near the front corner on a smooth vertical surface.  Use the double stick tape to position, but consider adding pop rivets or small screws to hold the setting for many years.  Holes are provided in the Hopkins levels.Use the front level first to drive onto leveling ramps or boards, then use the side level along with the tongue jack to finish (after you unhitch). Extend your stabilizer jacks and you're set for level comfortable sleeping in your camper. The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around! Solid pin. The keyhole cover slips often. I added 3 rubber o-rings to snug it up to the 2 inch hitch. 
You can't say much about this quick disconnect plug. But one for sure: having it installedcharging your motorcycle is much easier than using those old fashioned alligator clamps.If you also interested in buying a battery maintainer the harness is included in this one:&#34;Black & Decker BM3B 6V and 12V Battery Charger / Maintainer&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051D3MP6/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0You may also like to hear that there is a adapter available from SAE-2-USB plug available:&#34;SAE to USB Adapter - Motorcycle Cell Phone Charger&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007VFFQRE/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1So if you also use a navigation system while riding you can easily charge this on the road. A nice charger. Is also smaller than it appears on the picture. So easy to carry and handle.Unfortunately I had to send it back because it just has the standard clamps to charge.There were no &#34;Quick Disconnect Extension&#34; option to easy plug-n-charge a motorcycle.So I bought the &#34;Black & Decker BM3B 6V and 12V Battery Charger / Maintainer&#34;:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051D3MP6/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0 Perfect for exhaust work.  I bought it for a catalytic converter and o2 sensor project because it is rated for: -30F to 1800F 
The Wolo Model BA-97 Heavy Duty Commercial Grade Back-Up Alarm is perfect for the rear of any RV of size.  It&#8217;s small ( about 3 wide x 3&#8221; tall and 2&#8221; deep) and loud enough to alert anyone you are backing.  The sound is exactly like what you hear on garbage trucks and many commercial vehicles.Wiring the unit is simple and one of the mounting bolt/screw holes automatically grounds the horn to the vehicle chassis. I used the backup light wiring in the truck to trailer cable that was not used by my trailer to get the 12 Volt positive voltage to the trailer.  I then connected to the trailer wiring block using a14 gauge &#8220;hot&#8221; lead to take the voltage to the backup alarm mounted on the read of the trailer.  Whenever I have the trailer attached to the truck and then shift the truck into reverse Bingo.  The alarm begins beeping.  Of course anytime the truck backup lights are activated, like using the key fob to shut off the truck burglar alarm, the backup horn activates for about 30 seconds. This extension cable allows me to hook up my Battery Tender Plus to any vehicle in the garage.  The polarized end connectors maintain the proper polarity and that is important when charging batteries. This four station battery tender is just as simple to use as the single units.  One simply plugs the unit in and connects the battery via alligator clips or a connection affixed to the battery. Its a simple task to tell what state the battery is in.  If amber the battery is deep charging, if green range it is 80 to 100% charged.  After the battery is charged, leaving in connected will put the unit in float mode, which will keep the battery "topped off" without damaging it.  My only concern is the housing is plastic and all of my single units are metal.  It does have mounting holes so it can be wall mounted or affixed more securely to a shelf, etc.  Like the single units, total time from opening the box to charging is about 2 minutes.By the way, instructions for deciphering the state of the amber and green lights are not in the instruction manual but on the right side of the unit.I also ordered the 12 foot extension cables, a good call if you need to have your batteries more than about four feet from the unit. 
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. Great Fit Exact replacement from OEM. Exact fit worked perfect . Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs. 
Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.  The pickle fork is the last resort for me, as it will damage the balljoint boot.I prefer to use the Snap On balljoint remover.  If that one cannot fit, then I will try this tool.  If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork. Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. These item does fit perfect on my 2004 BMW x3. does what its suppose to do. so far so good thanks 
I was hoping to use the clay bar to remove water spots on a new truck but the one provided with this Mequiar's kit was worthless for this purpose. The kit does include everything you need to apply the products in the kit which is a plus and probably the reason the kit is so popular. I haven't had the need to install this yet but plan to this summer. I always use ACDelco parts when working on my GMC because I know I can't go wrong with genuine GM parts! I will update this review once I install it. Thanks Amazon for having ACDelco in stock when I need parts for my truck.EDIT: Installed this along with theACDelco 15-20676 Idler Pulleyfor my 2000 GMC Sierra 4x4. TIP: If working on a similar truck, make sure you remove the top half of the radiator shroud to make it easy to get to everyting. Install is pretty straight forward. I was simply delighted to FIND purple locktite. I needed the right product for set screws on rifle scopes. Purpose locktite is not to be had in local stores. Go for blue and you commit your set screws. I needed something that I could use with a small screw and remove if I needed to without stripping anything or resorting to heat guns. This is PERFECT. 
It a belt... it fits, it hold and it rotates. There is no noise coming from it.Happy with the fit and performance. Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. Great Fit 
I purchased this to be able to attach a high-end hydraulic assisted bike rake on the back of my Jeeps (JKs) with the rear tire still on.  It fit perfectly and teamed with the Bolt Lock BLT7018448 5/8'' Receiver Lock (Keyed specifically for your line of vehicle) it can be kept in the Jeep and my daughter doesn't need anything but her car key.The extender is exactly as advertised, well made, fit perfectly and does eactly what it is inteded for. I just purchased a 2012 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited and purchased the Rugged Ridge 13305.14 Black Windshield Pillar Rear Side Grab Handles for the back seat and the Rugged Ridge 13505.04 Ultimate Black Grab Handle for CJ Jeep and Wrangler 1955-2010 for the front seat, both of which compliment each other and fit nicely in my new Jeep.  I couldn't be happier with the look, style, quality and most importantly the strength of the handles.  I'm one step closer to off roading thanks to Rugged Ridge!!! Fits my hi-lift jack perfectly, which is mounted on the roof rack of my Jeep, and keeps the handle from rattling like crazy every time I hit the slightest bump.  Must-have for anyone riding with a high-lift jack in their vehicle. 
Simple install, 2-wire hookup. Works as advertised. It can be installed at 2 different angles, gives an option for mounting. Installed on a 2006 Acura MDX and it was painless... worst part of the install was getting out the interior panel holders as I did not have the proper tool. I installed this as an addition to a Python 991 system.  The sensor was simple to install and the color-coded wires and instructions were clear.  For the price, this is a lot of additional protection for the money. 
Even though Amazon says it does not fit my truck; it does fit my 2002 Chevrolet 2500HD crew cab with 6.0L gas engine. I replaced both sensors and harness. Both sensors were rough looking and the rear sensor had standing water on it. It was a little bit of a chore to get to them because you have to remove the intake but it was not too bad. They only fit around a standard thickness roll bar not the newer jeep arrangement with the plastic cover shroud of the late models. Perfect fit for rear window on my 2004 Ford Excursion Limited. Easy to install. No spotting seen or squeaking at all 
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. Great Fit They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. 
This seems to be one of the better levelers. There are two different scales on these levels. One is for the side-to-side (back of the coach) and the other is for the front-to-back (side of the coach). The reason there are different scales are they are more-or-less calibrated in inches.For example, it is simple Trigonometry to determine how many inches the coach is out of level simply by using the formula for right-angles and solve for one side. The input values are the angle (determined by the level) and distance from the level to the point at where you want to know how many inches of lift are needed.For the side-to-side level, the 1&#34; markings are pretty accurate as long as you put the scale in the center of the coach, as most coaches are within an inch or two of width from another.  However, for the front-to-back level, even though you put the scale in the center, the result will vary wildly due to the length of the coach. Using this level on a 18ft coach will result in a far different measurement than say a 35ft coach.Also, if you don't put the level in the center (in the side or back), then the two ends of the coach will be different. For example, if the level is in the center, then when the level measures 1&#34; off level, that means 1&#34; on either front or back. But if you put the level off-center, then the level reading 1&#34; might truly be 1/2&#34; on one end, and 1 1/2&#34; on the other. Again, it is simply a principle of Right Angles in Trigonometry.Also, do not rely on the self-adhesive backing as over time it can move. As hard as it may be for you to do, drilling a couple holes and inserting screws into the levels is the best bet. I bought two sets / 4 total. I use them near the middle of the lifting range which puts the saddle about 18 to 19 inches high. This is perfect to get my truck off the ground and give me an inch or so of ground clearance to R&R; the tires and do other work underneath the vehicle.I don't need 6t worth of lift, but I like how these j/s have a wide lifting range. With these set for my range (as stated above), they are not teetering at the top of the range like others I've used in the past, but are comfortably in the middle. They are very stable and solid units.It would be helpful if the info stated the lifting range of the units, not just the tonnage they can support as a pair.Min. Lift Height (in.)14 29/32Max. Lift Height (in.)23 1/2 Just make sure you measure the distance between the tires as they make 2 different sizes. The larger one would never have fit my trailer. I have found the more stable my trailer, the more comfortable it is.

It locks and unlocks well with a &#34;positive&#34; engagement feel when it is secure. Fits great for both my front bumper receiver and rear receiver on my 2005 Dodge Ram.  No complaints, and I'd definitely buy it again. I use it everyday primarily for a storage cover.  I have not had the cover on the bike in rain or weather.  I got the XL for my CBR500R with full large rear bags and windshield.  I can lock my helmet to the rear seat area put the cover on and it will cover up the entire bikes exhaust and 3/4 of the rear tire and entire front tire.  Two bungies mid bike and front tire enable hokking cover under bike.  Very sturdy and breathable with exhaust panels (silver durable material) and inner windshield liner.  Much bang for the buck. Would certainly purchase another if I had to without question.

These bulbs are bright, but you need to remember that: Ebay HIDs &#60; These Bulbs &#60; HIR &#60; HID.  If you think that the PNP HIDs are the best thing out there then go buy them if you however want a bright light that will not get you flashed at these are for you. I was soooo....happy to see these here on Vine. I had a set IDENTICAL to these in every way, how they are made, what they are made of, the contour, THIS brand, THIS actual Blade, on my conversion van and sold it and just had another brand of wipers on the car. I love these. The contour of them make them hug the windshield and keep it crystal clear with just one pass. I also noticed that when it was an icy windshield these didn't freeze to the window like most do. It was almost as if they had their own little antifreeze coating. I live in Iowa and even today we are getting another 8 inches of heavy wet snow and it's nice to know that these wipers will handle the load. I had them on the van for about 2 years and they still worked like the day I put them on. Can't wait to get them on the car... i just had to remove these on two vehicles,not these i mean the tinted ones. i had em on my truck for six years but now the cops are enforcing the law. Anything that blocks view or changes the color of the plate is not legal in a lotta states. I hope the cops dont mind these clear ones... 
How do you rate these?  They do exactly what they are supposed to do.  What more can I say.  It don't stink no more?!  LOL Never used one of these before so and the instructions are a little confusing so I did not know how to use it. I looked up YouTube and found out how to use it and it works fine. I probably should compare it to another to see how accurate it is, but I really like how easy it is to use and turns off and on by itself. 
Fits on my Hi-Lift jack just fine. Does exactly what it is supposed to do.If you are using it on wheels that are deep make sure the straps are long enough to reach the spoke pattern. Get these and stop bonkin the noggin. I used a stepladder to hold the liftgate while making the swap. It's a real mouse trap otherwise. These supports are exact replacement, fit perfect. If you lift the gate fully by hand you don't have to fight to make these things go on there. Simple, easy swap. the bag it came with dosent fit it, if youve got it adjusted to the middle or top setting, this does exactley what they say, seems pretty rugged, it fits my duratrac 245/75/16s perfect and holds my 225lb self no prob.

California 2000 V6 Camry with P1150 and P1155. Two of my code tables show as Bank 1 Sensor 2 A/F sensor so I ordered the Denso 234-4209 O2 sensor. Came in on time and package well protected but looks like its the wrong one - my fault, somewhat. Turns out, as far as I could tell, my two tables from two different sources had it backwards as it should be Bank 2 Sensor 1 A/F and Denso/Amazon order check didn't help much either.Anyway, Bank 2 Sensor 1 is the one on the engine right front (easy to get to) where Denso refer as Upstream Front. I gave it 5 stars base on previous experience, will order this one later.Why the a few of you refer as Bank 1 Sensor 1 and still corrected the check engine light? That would not be this one for the the Toyota V6 but Denso 234-9007 where they refer as Upstream Rear. Am I wrong?Seems like I'm not the only one confused based on superceeded information on P1150 and P1155.This one is for Bank 2 Sensor 1 for the Toyota V6 engine (mine is the 1MZFE). 
Made in China poor quality item that does not befit the Robert Bosch brand at all.Not for winter for sure.The origin of the product should be stated at the product page.If I knew it were a MADE-IN-CHINA I would not have bought it. Very cheaply made product. It works but could be made with better quality product. Probably wouldn't buy this product again Considering this is made in China, it is a quality product, too bad all my locks are keyed to the some number 
A little 1/2 ounce tube at the parts store was almost 5 bucks. this is great for exhaust manifold bolts and where heat and rust are a problem. Comes with an applicator brush attached to the cap. Can use on all bolts, never have to worry about breaking another bolt cause it welded itself to the thread. a must for auto enthusiasts. OEM quality, as mentioned, made in Japan.  The only gripe is the OEM cap has Honda screws that are have washer locks on them to keep them on the cap and thus less likely to drop while removing them.  The replacement screws are separate.  The cap also comes with a replacement gasket.TIP:  Always replace plug wires one at a time from the old cap to the new cap in the same order/rotation you pull from.May as well replace the rotor and coil while you are at it:Beck Arnley  173-7988  Ignition RotorOEM 5100A Ignition Coil These hose clamp pliers are a godsend.  It makes easy work of getting those spring type clamps off where they usually are tucked in the most inopportune places.  I do like the pliers however I would additionally recommend getting a set of bent tip needle-nose type pliers as well.  I find myself grabbing the bent (angled tip) needle-nose for the majority of my spring hose clamp work and using the cable type for ones that are just too far deep in the engine bay.These work great for undoing the lower radiator hose clamps in many cars.  I think every serious mechanic should have a set of these.  No problems with the quality. 
Exact same filter they sell at walmart or an auto parts store.  Save the money and buy online isntead of paying more dollars for local purchase. The same ones at the local storefront were more costly for the same ones.  Amazon pricing once again wins again! this is the same filter they sell at walmart and auto parts stores. Save your money and buy it here online. Works great! 
They say if you buy the best you won't be sorry.  But just because it costs more doesn't mean it's the best, does it?  Well I think in this particular case it is the best.  And you will pay for it.The Chevron Techron product gets high scores from everyone & everything I have read in many automotive mags, but the equipment they make it with must be made from gold boullion.  Suffice it to say if you want to clean your engine parts that gas touches, this stuff is the best.  I just gave it 4 stars because of price not quality.  I own several cars, motorcycle, boat, waverunners, so I'd buy it by the case if the price would come down enough to make it worth while.  On the other hand if you have one or two cars, I guess you don't need to put it in the tank all that frequently to obtain the results you want.  A bottle of piece of mind?  Yes, it works. As an engineer, its pretty rare that I find a product that I can't find fault with. Probably 98% of the stuff I own and that I buy, could use improvement in one way or another. This falls in the rare and coveted 2% that I would call a perfect product. Its waterproof, (big deal for a car battery charger) it can't be easily short circuited, it automatically cuts off at full charge, and it has a float mode. Don't know what more you could ask for a $30 car charger. As far as that goes, I'd say its probably the best one on the market and will be for a long while to come. Very satisfied with it. The only thing that it can't do is revive what they call &#34;sleeping battery&#34;. But its my understanding that you need a much larger apparatus for that. I am reading lots of bad reviews on these pigtails.  What worries me the most is some seem to be shipping with a different thread type and people are stripping them trying to make them work.  Why the heck can't these be standardized?  I've also read that some come with different sizes of NPT as well as different thread types.  It seems that what is listed is not always what you order, and on top of that, someone like me, who does not know how to recognize the different thread types and sizes won't even know if I received the correct part or the wrong part.I recommend you double check your part number on the hose before installing them to avoid stripping your regulator.I thought, why not use quick connect hoses to connect my regulator to my appliance.  It seems these mate up nice to other quick connects--but only if made by CAMCO, and then these quick connect fittings don't mate up easily to the other parts like regulators etc.  WTF?  I need still another adapter?  And some people tell me perhaps multiple adapters to make it all work?  I'm not going to use three different adapters to mate up a quick connect.  That means I have a huge lunking thing sticking out ready to be damaged, knocked out of place, that is sure to leak out all my expensive propane.Ok, so I called CAMCO.  I wanted to be sure I ordered the right part and spoke to two different people at CAMCO that blew me off.  It seems Camco parts don't necessarily fit each other.  And they don't sell adapters to make them fit. It would be great if they could provide some customer support and perhaps make up some custom hoses to help people make things work.I give this a 1 star because CAMCO's huge fail in helping me put together a system that will allow me to hook up external tanks to my RV.One star also, because they ship different types of hose fittings and buyers don't know what they are getting.Honestly, I'd like to order one of every one of their parts and analyze them.  I'm an engineer, and if I can't figure out what to order, based on conflicting information--reviews that report receiving different size fittings 1/4&#34; npt than specified 3/8&#34; npt, and a multitude of part numbers--and a need for adapters when a buyer should be able to buy everything he or she needs without an adapter---it all tells me CAMCO has not thought out how their products are used.Think about it, there are only so many way propane tanks, hoses and appliances are hooked up. I don't see any need for adapter other than those that attach to the tanks. 
I like it.  Attached to the hose I use to fill the tank on my trailer it is easy to use and gives you the ability to control the flow of water. Water Wetter is designed to be used in a system of solely distilled water. Water Wetter is then added to the mix to help the water have better contact with the metal.  Redline's claim is that with just water air will accumulate due to the heat on the metal's surface and this does not allow maximum heat transfer to the water. The Water Wetter will stop that air from forming thus allowing for more cooling potential. According to their results, up to 20 degrees.Now this can also be used in systems with a mixture of water and antifreeze but the results will be severly diminished, down to just a couple of degrees. On top of that beware of the "black sludge" that can accumulate with Water Wetter combining with certain types of Antifreeze. I would recommened using google to find results on this.Redline does recommened draining and refilling the system of Water Wetter and water once a year. This in my opinion is due to the fact that this is designed to be used in race cars and not so much street vehicles, yes even high performance street vehichles. If you are doing research you will find one over riding response "if you have a cooling system problem this will not fix it."I purchased this before I did enough research. I have decided not to use the product and take a loss on the investment. My car is a street car and I was going to flush my system and use only distilled water, since I live in an area that doesn't have to worry about freezing. After doing my research I will go with just a higher percentage of distilled water to antifreeze. This will help keep my maintenance time to a minimum and also increase my cooling efficiency. This works very well for blowing out water supply lines in an RV's plumbing system.  Be aware that there can be water still in the lines even after blowing out air through every faucet, so when winterizing, it can't hurt to use a RV safe antifreeze just to keep the water at the low spots (elbows, valves) from freezing. 
Seems a bit flimsy but works well .... I always hated leaving the hose in when it topped off and water spewed out I would need to run to the hose to turn it off while it was geyser of water flying out the side of my trailer .... I just wait till its full ... turn the shut-off valve off and I'm good to go wit no mess. Plus having a large valve at the end help with the hose not folding and crimping. For the price it does what it's suppose to do. This is a high-quality, well made grease gun. It connects well, and you have to move the connection sideways to pop it off the grease fitting - which is perfect because you do not want on that pops off easily. I pumped a lot of grease through this into hubs and the pressure was high, the pump action was smooth and nothing leasked. When disconnected, it also does not leak (it does not pressure out unless you pump it). Does exactly what it is supposed to and you can use it without having to run around the vehicle to turn the water on and off. 
This is a very good nozzle. It allows a good amount of control of the water spray pattern, ranging from a wide fan delivering a low pressure water stream, through to a high pressure, narrow stream. Perfect for cleaning cars (using a medium fan of water to get the car wet and to rinse off the soap, and a high pressure spray to remove road grime from the wheels and underside). It's good for watering plants too, using the fan end of the selector range. If you get it just right you can actually get it to mist too.The only thing this nozzle is missing is a quick on/off mechanism. As it is, you turn it off by rotating the front to one end or the other. This is the same mechanism used to select the spray pattern. This is a design improvement over the original, which only had the off position at one end of the spray selection.The rubber coated aluminum design is very sturdy and will last for years... the last one did. The only reason I had to replace the last one was my mistake... I left it attached to the hose for a few years and either the hard water or electrolysis caused it to become permanently stuck to the brass end of the hose, and it got damaged when I tried to remove it. Lesson learned... I remove it from the hose when it's not in regular use. The sky high ratings intrigued me, so when the Bon-Aire "ultimate" nozzle was available as a Lightning Deal, I bought one to see if it lived up to the hype.The product appears to be very well constructed, and is quite a bit larger and heavier, than your typical cheapo nozzle.  You adjust the flow of water by turning the spray head at the front.  Water flow can be cut off at either end of the range, as the flow pattern goes from off, to a gentle sprinkle, to wide spray, and then narrowing into a beam, and then off again.  Because of the larger sized head, the "ultimate" nozzle has a larger area of coverage, and can deliver a larger volume of water.The nozzle does a decent job of diffusing water flow, producing a nice gentle flowing fountain of water suitable for watering potted plants or delicate flowers.  When adjusted more to a spray, it is well suited for vegetable gardens and general use.  This is however, nothing unique as far as sprinkler nozzles go.Fully open, the front aperture is about 0.12 inches in diameter, which produces a thicker stream of water than your typical cheapo nozzle.  Sometimes a thick stream is advantageous, but you will be using more water, and the increased water pressure may stress your plumbing.  Unless your system has high volume, and good water pressure, you may not be able to take full advantage this nozzle.The nozzle appears to be solidly built, and seems to work as advertised.  Unfortunately the aluminum parts on mine have a reddish finish, rather than green, which looks cooler.  Although it can deliver a higher volume of water, the assertion that it is the "ultimate" is perhaps an overstatement.  It does a good job, but not that much better than the various cheapo nozzles and spray guns.  The economy models typically don't last very long, so if "the ultimate" proves to be durable, it might be worth the premium cost.  It's a bit heavy, and encourages using more water, so at this point I like it more than love it. 2 different hoses, totally different results. I typically use a light duty pocket hose to wash my car since it's easier to tote around, but it doesn't flow nearly enough pressure for this nozzle. I switched to my standard 3/4" rubber hose and it was night and day. This nozzle NEEDS a high-volume hose to function properly. Build quality is second to none, but I knocked it down a star because my other nozzles work just fine with my light duty hose. 
First, as with all of the Dupli-Color Metalcast paints, if you want the metalcast effect, you'll have to use the Dupli-Color Metalcast Ground Coat (MC100) on the surface before you apply the color or it will not come out right. The can says that it also comes out the same if you're painting directly onto chrome like surface but I have not tried this so I don't know. Now for this green. I'm more of a blue and purple guy for dark colors so only by my personal preference do I say that this green comes out just a tad light in color for me. Overall though, if you use the ground coat this comes out great with a nice metal sheen. I recommend this product. ... if the delivery mechanism was able to spray it on in a wide pattern rather than a spot pattern. It took numerous squeezes of the sprayer to get adequate coverage. The product itself was excellent. This is great wax! It truly deserves the Gold Class name. I use this after the Meguiar's Ultimate Polish. I also have migrated to a 6 in buffer/polisher. I used to do all of my polishing and waxing by hand, and with the buffer, this turns out great. I have an 89 LeSabre that is Black Sapphire in color. Before using the polish/wax combo, it looked more like a darker blue. Nothing really deep. After polishing and waxing, it now looks like the black in black sapphire. It looks great in the shade, as it should and looks beautiful in the sun. There is a nice deep, glassy color, and I am pleased with the results. The water also beads very nice, too. 
IHAVEN'T HAD THE CHANCE TO USE THIS MUCH BUT THE ONE TIME I DID, IT DIDN'T HOLD. I TRULY THINK THESE TYPES OF THINGS SIMPLY DO NOT SHIP WELL DURING THE WINTER MONTHS. IT SEEMS KIND OF WATERY. This look great and worked very well. only had the chance to use one time. end of the camping season for winter is now upon use.. I don't know why this product isn't already on all campers when you buy them. would and will tell my friends about this product.greatly meets my expectation. The bottle works wonderful, really last a long time! 5 stars! All the way I love this produce I used it all the times 
This air gauge is dead on accurate, it seals completely, allows air to flow the way it should and the two headed chuck fit all cars, trucks and even those pesky hard to reach motorcycle valve stems. I own three motorcycles and there is nothing more aggravating than trying to fit a chuck in between rotors, fork tubes and tight spaces on a motorcycle. You know what I mean. This two headed angled chuck is angled perfectly to fit over a cycle stem without leaking or having to bend the valve stem. I love it. a regular 32mm socket will not fit in the space of my equinox. this is a kind of shorter 32mm socket designed only for oil filter cap job. it works fine. The sewer hose support is very handy. Comes small enought and with a nice handle to carry. It expands from 1 foot to 20 feet and inbetween. Now there is no worries about not having enough of a pitch on the sewer hose from the camper to the sewer drain. With this placed properly so that the sewer hose slants away from the camper towards the drain (and not up hill) I dont have to worry about a potiential clog in the hose and everything empting out with a proper flow. 
It does exactly what it's supposed to do. No problems whatsoever. Does what it says it does......looks great ! My unit did not come with any instructions.  The tool seems too complicated to be very useful, but does work. 
Well made Excellent quality.  American made.  Top notch all the way around.  Built to last. Great quality.  American made. 
This buffer has plenty of power to get the job done, and appears to be well worth the money.  Some minor assembly is required.  There is a `manual' but it does not contain any instructions, instead it mostly covers general safety.  Assembly is fairly simple.  You first attach the curved top handle, either with or without, the straight side handle.  The handle can be installed for either right or left hand operators.  The buffer is top heavy, so installing the side handle is highly recommended.This unit comes with the accessories to get started right away.  For buffing, it has a wool pad, and rubber backing pad.  For sanding, a Velcro backed hard plastic disc is included, but you will need to provide the sandpaper inserts.  A special wrench for locking down the rubber backing pad is included.Controls are pretty basic.  There is a throttle switch on the bottom of the handle, with a lock button to keep the motor running.  The speed control dial is on the top of the housing, and goes from 1 to 6 (maximum).  The buffer starts to whine at around level 3, and gets screaming loud at full speed, when ear protection is definitely recommended.  The amount of vibration will vary according to the task, and motor speed.  When sanding or buffing fine dust is typically produced, so you may want to wear eye protection and a dust mask.If you are into weightlifting, using the buffer on a vehicle may not be too difficult, but for those not so physically fit, managing the weight and vibration, could be a challenge.  Because of the tool is about 18 inches long, your hands end up positioned about a foot apart, in order to keep the torque generated by the buffer under control.  Just a little inattention can result in losing control, or dropping the buffer, and you don't want to hurt yourself, damage your paint job, dent your vehicle, or damage anything else.The supplied wool buffer is quite thick, and does a pretty good job, but you do need to apply pressure for it to work.  For the average sedan, buffing the hood and trunk should be the easiest.  Things get harder when you do the sides, or curved or irregular surfaces, and have to both support the weight of the buffer, and apply pressure to the surface.  Buffing non-flat areas usually requires changing angles, and varying the point of contact, and amount of pressure applied.  Users will need to find the grip and techniques that work best.  Buffing will require some finesse at times, and if your muscles are straining, this is when accidents can happen, or you can hurt yourself.  Doing the roof can be tricky as well.The listed weight of eight pounds, may not sound like a lot, but if you are bracing your body, locking your forearms, and squeezing hard on the handles for an extended period of time, you may find your muscles a bit sore, or in `shock' from the vibration, if you overdo it.  Just go easy when using it for the first few times.The pictured buffer has a blue plastic housing and black handle, but the unit also comes with an orange plastic housing.  It has a ten foot cord with a twin blade plug, and comes with a set of spare brushes.  The buffer does produce very good results, so if you have a strong back, and the upper body strength, it could be a very cool buy. What can you say except that it holds a lot and has a big opening. The lid doesn't have a gasket so don't tilt or turn over. the only other small gripe is the hinge on the lid hits the handle and will probably help the fatigue factor Permatex is the stuff my automotive junkies.  It will allow you to undo what you have done.  You do know that spark plugs come back out don't you?  Make sure the application is correct.  Some metal combinations will prefer nickel over copper based and so on. but for general use, this is the goop for you. 
The Tender Jr. does not come with a cigarette adapter so I cut this in half to make two. I purchased 2 lighter plugs for a buck each from China&#8230; with free shipping&#8230; and they are working fine. These aren&#8217;t an exact match with the Tender cables but they fit together OK and are easy to determine polarity with the wire colors. You can also just use this as an extension cord for your Tender. The description states a length of 12-inches&#8230; but it&#8217;s actually 14-inches tip-to-tip on the connectors. Nice item for the price and it&#8217;s made in Mexico. put them on a 2011 jeep wrangler .These look great and go on with ease. If your are looking for taillight guards these are the ones to get. Btw the screws are the same length but a different diameter so follow instructions. I purchased these pegs to install on my Suzuki motorcycle.  I needed 10mm bolt sizing for my application, and these pegs meet that requirement.  The fit and finish is very good, and these pegs represent an excellent value for the price. 
People, this for the money is the best blade for your vehicle.They hold to the contour of the windshield and clear the window cleanly.Yes, they cost close to $20 (or more, depending on your vehicle) each, but they offer superior operation.  I've been using them on my 2003 Dodge Ram 1500 (Hemi) for three years now and I don't mind paying the price (twice a year, weather in Michigan is brutal) for these blades.  I was buying OEM type blades and replacing them every three to four months, so do the math... these cost about the same when OEM cost $5-$8 each.  Remember, Blades are sold separate not in pairs like blade replacements. I didnt need all the pieces but this kit had what i needed.  I may use the other pieces at a later time, so this kit for the price was a great investment.  Very hight quality. When looking at these products, simply calculate the actual cost per square foot. for example this"speaker kit" contains 1.38 square feet, for around 22 bucks(price fluxuates like its a stock or something?)can u think of anything thats worth 15 dollars a square foot? there are so many cheaper alternatives. dynamat is an awsome product, and it does work. but for those of us not made of money, search this "butyl flashing tape" u will be glad u did. 
The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around! Super heavy chain. Adjust chain so the tripod is about 6 inches lower that leveled trailer. Raise tripod using wrench included. Do not supoport full weight of trailer. This is for stabilization of the 5th wheel. In our case in provided extra stabilization for the bedroom. There are two horns, not one. One is 400Hz and the other one is 500Hz.PIAA | Automotive Sports Horn (400/500Hz) #85110The are exact fits on the mounts as the OEM horns and use the same bolts. A 1/4 inch drive ratchet and a 12mm socket is needed to remove and install the bolt. They came with grounding leads with ring spade lugs that mounted readily under the existing M6 bolts on the radiator supports. All you need is a 10mm socket.The two wiring harness leads are too short to connect the horns. Two wire tie mounts hold the harness to the aluminum bumper reinforcement. You can cut off the ties and use the OEM harness to connect the horns, but I chose not to.  I prefer NOT to cut off the OEM connector blocks.I made two pigtail extensions out of 18 gauge black primary wire, 5 inches long. One end needs a 1/4 inch wide exposed male quick disconnect. The other end needs an insulated female 1/4 inch quick disconnect terminal. Since I used 18 gauge wire, I used the red coded ones.The exposed male connector slides into the OEM horn connector perfectly. The female one clips easily onto the positive terminal of each horn.The horns how have a weather shield on the apertures.Best thing to my surprise is that they appear to be very high quality and Made in Japan.Also nice is that they need no modification to the horn relay or circuit. 
Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars Great Fit Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. 
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. Exact replacement from OEM. Exact fit worked perfect . Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs. Great Fit 
These are the best wiper blades I have used -- much better than other Rain-X blades. My only complaint is they are ugly. The connector is bulky and the arms are all plastic, making them look cheap. I would give these an extra star if they were lower profile. That being said, I would definitely recommend them. I love these things. They could be cheaper but are still reasonable and they seem better constructed than other brands I've purchased. Excellent option for an applicator sponge. These filters are of a better quality than stock, cost about the same or less than stock and are mudh easier to remove.  Even the feel between stock and these K & N's is noticable.  They use better quality cases, filter media and gaskets.  Highly recommend. 
Great wheel lock that is easy to activate and unlock.  It comes with 3 keys, one of which has a LED light on it.  The product also comes with a reminder cord that attaches to the handle bar as a reminder.  It does just what I was looking for. The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable.

The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around! I purchased this to be able to attach a high-end hydraulic assisted bike rake on the back of my Jeeps (JKs) with the rear tire still on.  It fit perfectly and teamed with the Bolt Lock BLT7018448 5/8'' Receiver Lock (Keyed specifically for your line of vehicle) it can be kept in the Jeep and my daughter doesn't need anything but her car key.The extender is exactly as advertised, well made, fit perfectly and does eactly what it is inteded for. 
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Works great, nice to have a second cable, but the OBD end of the cable is angled.  In my case, this cable won't work on my Subaru Outback.  I would prefer the option of a straight OBD connector.  Note that the angle connector works on my other four cars (Mazda, Honda, Dodge). Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted.

At less then $10 this is a steal!  The unit is well made and really does a nice job.  It's far bettter then the round adapter that plugs straight in and that on the back side you plug in the 30 amp cord.  The 90 degree 15 amp plug emliminates the problem of the cord pulling out or partially disconnecting from the outlet. Easy to replace. It lacks Toyota instructions, but it is exactly like existing Toyota part with all wires colored the same way so it is very obvious how to connect those.The original part has a silicone rubber tube going all the way from top to bottom with wires running inside it. This part only provides a short length of tubing that, at best, would cover half of the length of wires on my car.I thing they should provide a &#34;telescoping&#34; tubing of two diameters with one going inside of the other while you are crimping wires and then extended to cover the full length of wires 
CAVEAT: I have a front-wheel drive car, and I *back* into my garage.  The parking mat goes under my rear (un-driven) wheels.  Perhaps that makes my experience different from some of the others.I found about this product from a show on Speed Channel that was talking about garage products.  The host said the big benefit of this mat was that your tire rolled onto the front part of the mat first, holding it down, before it rolled it over the hump.  Thus, this mat didn't need to be fixed to your garage floor.  That's what I wanted: something that didn't need to be permanently attached to the floor.  The guy on TV didn't even mention that it came with tape.I did put a little masking tape on the garage floor to mark where I typically position the mat, so I can remove it (to sweep or whatever) and replace it right back where it goes as needed.  I don't use the adhesive tape it comes with to adhere it to the floor.  In my case, it works perfectly, just like the guys on Speed Channel described.  I've used it for a little over a month now, and my mat simply doesn't move.  (Ok, maybe it moves some ridiculously trivial amount, but for all intents and purposes, it has stayed put for a month.)  If the mat is going under your driven wheels or steering wheels, I can understand how it might move around.Others have complained that the mat is too narrow.  I wouldn't complain if they made it a little wider, but I don't have much trouble hitting it as it is. When I saw at the picture online I thought they were reflective, like a mirror finish, but they were just light gray, with a darker fabric on some of the sides. They fit the window fairly well, with only a small area in the bottom middle of the window where light gets in. It does help a little with keeping the car and steering wheel from getting too hot while sitting in the sun. Its better than using nothing. I grew up in the 80's so I remember well playing with Legos.  Building everying from cars to forts.  Well the Tri Lynx Comapny has brought us back our nostalic youth with Tri Lynx Levelers.  These are large square plastic pads (roughly 9"x9"x1" thick) that are stackable to just about any confgiuration you can imagine.  You can stack them in a "column" fasion for leveling jacks.  Or you can stack them in an offset alternating "brick wall" fasion for an interlocking leveler that is safe to drive on without fear of displacement.  They can even be stacked side by side for larger duel wheel RVs.  For my use, I wanted to use them for my leveling jacks and for pads were there was a side leaning tilt.  The box says to never stack more than 4 levelers high for a single configuration.  I've gone to 10 under my jacks and they still feel rock solid once pressure is put on them.I'm on my 4th set of Lynx levelers.  I'm convinced you can't have too many.  With that I fianlly invested in these "Stop'n Chocks"  Wonderful!!!  As I said these can be used under your wheels as well.  So the Stop n' Chalk stacks as the last piece at the rear of the Lynx configuration to allow the driver  just back up against them.  Now these are the most versitle set of leveling / chalking pads you can buy becasue they allow for front to rear leveling and side to side leveling.  If one side of the coach is lower than the other, you can build up just that side and use standard chalks on the other.  Also if you have enough of the Tri Lynx levelers you could potentially place say 2" of lift under a front axel on an tandem configuration and 4 or even 5" under a rear.  The one draw back is that you would need enough to building this as one continous pad (say 8' long or so.)  But like legos, if you have enough, your imagination is the limit.A couple of notes:  You MUST use these in conjunction with TriLynx levelers.  They will not work on their own.  In addition there is a noctch carved out of the front to force the user to stack in the above mentioned "brick wall" alternating fasion so that there's no risk of sepertaion between the levels as the rig is driving on or off the pad.  Also, I stongly suggest a spotter!  Driving a rig on or off a 9" wide "rail" is dangerous and having someone to tell you that you a little too close to the edge is a must. 
I installed one of these springs at the bottom of the door.  As others have said, 1 seems plenty strong to close the door without making it slam.  If you only hold the door a few inches open, it won't latch.  But if you open it like you are walking out it will close tight and the latch engages.I think installing the second spring will make the door slam too hard.  But its nice having the second spring just in case you need it.I installed it using the existing screw on the outside of the screen door (where the hinge attaches).  I think measured up 9" (as the directions say) and drilled a hole such that the spring fits between the screen door and the outside door when they are both closed.- to be clear - when you are standing outside the camper, with the screen door closed, you see the spring go from the hinge on the screen door to the door frame.The pictures in the directions seemed a little confusing to me.  It looks more like they want you to put the spring on the inside of the door.  But then you have the spring dragging across the frame when you open the door, scratching the frame and probably making a lot of noise.My way of installing it has zero noise (the spring is not rubbing on anything) and it works nicely.Just make sure there is adequate clearance between your outside door and your screen door before installing the spring.I will take a picture if I get a chance and post it.*** UPDATE ***I added a picture with notes.We had the camper out for 5 days and the spring worked great.  Using just 1 spring is enough to close the screen door and it even will pull the combined screen & exterior doors closed.  (not hard enough to latch, but closed).  I think I will leave it as-is and keep the second spring as a backup. I use this to open my screen door without having to to open the sliding panel to reach inside to open the door.  Keeps bugs out while making the door easier to open from outside. We got these to put on the RV doors.  We used one for door and they really work.  No more having to slam it shut as the springs brings the door into a closed position.

But then you have the spring dragging across the frame when you open the door, scratching the frame and probably making a lot of noise.My way of installing it has zero noise (the spring is not rubbing on anything) and it works nicely.Just make sure there is adequate clearance between your outside door and your screen door before installing the spring.I will take a picture if I get a chance and post it.*** UPDATE ***I added a picture with notes.We had the camper out for 5 days and the spring worked great.  Using just 1 spring is enough to close the screen door and it even will pull the combined screen & exterior doors closed.  (not hard enough to latch, but closed).  I think I will leave it as-is and keep the second spring as a backup. I purchased this to be able to attach a high-end hydraulic assisted bike rake on the back of my Jeeps (JKs) with the rear tire still on.  It fit perfectly and teamed with the Bolt Lock BLT7018448 5/8'' Receiver Lock (Keyed specifically for your line of vehicle) it can be kept in the Jeep and my daughter doesn't need anything but her car key.The extender is exactly as advertised, well made, fit perfectly and does eactly what it is inteded for. Hooked this up on my Jayco travel trailer to keep the bugs out. My five year old just loves running in and out without closing the screen door. This keeps the door closed with ease, and can even close the screen and main door. 
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. Great Fit Exact replacement from OEM. Exact fit worked perfect . Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs. 
The label on the box clearly says "Not for towing". This is used mainly for bike rack.Easy to install and quality is OK. It comes with a bolt and washer for securing the extension to your vehicle. The bolt and washer work together to prevent hitch extension from wobbling. So, it's like getting both the hitch extension and a wobbling stopper in one good price.In summary, it serves the intended purpose well with the addition of wobbling stopper. Good deal. Fits perfect along with my curt receiver. What I love the most is that you don't need to have the key on the lock in order to lock it on the pin. The provided dust cover is great to prevent any water and dust away from the internal mechanisms. Haven't had any problems yet. The keys are tough unlike some other ones that break when turning them. This Curt Manufacturing 5/8 in. Hitch Lock works great so far.  I have not had any issues with it yet. 
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. The tool appears to be of average quality.  However, I returned it to Amazon since it did not fit up to a Ford Taurus flex fuel engine.  This type of engine requires a special fitting that this tool does not have. 
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend. I bought this belt for my 2003 Chevy Tahoe with the 5.3L engine and 145A Alternator. Make sure you know which alternator you have BEFORE purchasing this belt. The 105A alternators use a slightly shorter belt. It fits perfectly, doesn't make any noise and works great! You will also need the smallerGoodyear 4040377 Gatorback Poly V-Beltfor the A/C system on these vehicles.My 145 Amp Alternator has a 145A stamped on the side, visible from the drivers side. You could also look for the old belt part number on the existing belt and order accordingly. Received within 3 days. Saw Mythbusters do a test of these LifeHammers and they worked quite well cutting through the seatbealt and any of the windows EXCEPT the WINDSHIELD. Commit that to memory! In a emergency situation it will not easily crack or break the windshield, side and rear glass only. Mine is getting mounted in clear sight and access from the front seat, right in the middle of the rear seat benches so as to be easily grabbed by all! I have had experience with a stuck seat belt and they are a bitch to cut through with a semi-sharp pockt knife. 
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. Great Fit Exact replacement from OEM. Exact fit worked perfect . Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs. 
The Tender Jr. does not come with a cigarette adapter so I cut this in half to make two. I purchased 2 lighter plugs for a buck each from China&#8230; with free shipping&#8230; and they are working fine. These aren&#8217;t an exact match with the Tender cables but they fit together OK and are easy to determine polarity with the wire colors. You can also just use this as an extension cord for your Tender. The description states a length of 12-inches&#8230; but it&#8217;s actually 14-inches tip-to-tip on the connectors. Nice item for the price and it&#8217;s made in Mexico. please note these are not white - but beige... other than that they are standard rv baggage catches these are a great additional tool for leveling the front and sides of the camper when you are by ourself! They are large enough to see from a distance to keep things on the level 
32mm is the correct size for my Jetta TDI oil cap, and this fits perfectly.It's also fairly low profile, another plus. The meter has all the functions you could ask for a multimeter in a compact size.  The digits are large for the size of the meter, so it's easily readable by middle aged eyes. Worked well for adjusting valves on my Honda Accord.  Price was right and they had all the standard sizes which are close enough to the metric 
This was used with the Battery Tender 800 on a lawn tractor and this cable is used to go from an outlet INSIDE the garage to the battery cable on the lawn tractor. I have 3 cars and a boat. The boat has 3 batteries. This will accommodate regular car batteries to house batteries for the boat. I have one permanently connected on my mini-motorhome.  It works great while connected to AC power AND the engine is running.  Whenever I'm hooked up to AC power, the battery is maintained when powered up and not damaged when the engine is running.  I'd surely call this a must have for RV's. 
Battery Tender makes good stuff, and this is another of their useful tools. It's very simple, a no-nonsense extension cord that comes in handy when the battery charger has to be plugged in a little distance from my motorcycle or when operating a tire pump a ways away. I bought this item for the battery tender .  Hook it up to the battery terminals and plug it in the battery tender. I ordered 2 different chargers to maintain my gate opener's deep cycle battery (a simple 4 output charger with extension cords for charging other deep cycle batteries from amazonBattery Tender 022-0148-DL-WH 12V 4-Bank Battery Management System) and this unit has a far superior charging design.The 4 bank battery tender does a simple fast rate charge then switches to a trickle charge at a constant voltage with 4 outputs.This unit pulses the battery under charge and features 3 operating modes with different current outputs for different sized batteries. The selections are motorcycle which also works well for SLA gel cells or AGM batteries, standard automotive starting battery, deep cycle batttery, and off.What makes the CTEK unit special is that it uses a pulse charge in all modes to attempt to desulphate batteries, while the battery tender does not.  This method of charging has proven successful in restoring lead acid batteries that won't take a charge any more.It comes with a waterproof 12V output cable and a set of clips or rings for permanent installation under the hood of your car.  In addition to the LEDs for indicating the type of battery being charged, a second set is provided for empty, 1/2 full, and maintenance pulse charge mode.There is also a noticable increase in quality between the battery tender and this unit - small details like a water sealed housing and gaskets on the connectors indicate quality in manufacture.For a single 12V lead chemistry battery this is a useful, well made tool. 
We use these to put color logos on the inside of the plate for display on the front of the vehicle. Back ground can be painted in on the inside of the plate for better contrast. The door protector is the perfect size. thick enough to protect the door even if you open too hard. Other protectors are thinner. Easy to mount. You will need to provide your own screws. THIS IS A STURDY AND INEXPENSIVE LICENSE PLATE HOLDER THAT ALLOWS FOR THE PLATE TO SIT ON THE EDGE OF THE HOLDER BECAUSE OF IT'S DESIGN.  GOOD PRODUCT. 
I've gotten a few sets of these (4) to cover the heads of my front and rear license plate bolts and I've had mostly good results from these covers. I reviewed a separate kit that came with the bolts and threaded plastic mounts for your bumper but that did not directly talk about the covers (I think, who can remember?). These covers and the clear plastic rings which allow the caps to be held in place are easy to install with the single exception that the holes in the clear plastic rings are almost always a little larger that the diameter of the bolts holding your plate in place. This creates the small problem of a chance to accidently crush the top of the ring as you re-tighten each bolt because the ring will sit low on the bolt threads causing the outer portion of the ring (which allows the cap to &#34;snap&#34; and be held in place) so that it falls under the back of the bolt head. So you'll need to slip the ring over the bolt head and you get near the end of tightening down the bolt. The only other problem I've had with these caps is that one cap in one set (new) split as I was snapping it onto the clear plastic ring. I had extras form an old set so no big deal. I never &#34;lost&#34; one of these caps from it popping off during driving so they're a great cover and they do come in multiple colors depending on what you're looking for. I recommend this product. I have two cars, both of which require the large #14 sheet metal self-tapping screws to mount the plate to the nylon retainers behind the plate (the ones mounted on the car that the screws screw into). Problem is that diameter of the plastic ring that holds the screw covers is too small to take the screw's large diameter head. The maximum screw head diameter that will fit the ring is .435 inch (11 millimeters). Option 1: Replace the nylon retainers on the car, but different cars have different retainers so one must search for new ones that will accept a #12 screw. Option 2: Try to find #14 self-tapping screws with smaller heads. I shopped around for #14 screws with smaller heads to no avail. Option 3: Grind down the screw head's diameter. Option 4 (not good): On one car I used #12 sheet metal screws that have a smaller diameter, but DO fit the rings, and wrapped the threads with tape. This sort of works, but I really can't tighten them down satisfactorily. So I have to check their security now and then. I'm leaving the other car as is for now. Maybe someone has more practical ideas? Sure would like to hear of them. BTW, SEE THE UPDATE BELOW.UPDATE 11/16/13:I think I've found a viable solution to the above problem. I used a #12 sheet metal self-tapping screw, placed a 1/2-inch long piece of ordinary shrink tubing (1/4" i.d.) over the threads towards the pointed end of the screw. Used a heat gun (or you can use a match, BIC lighter or soldering iron) to shrink the tubing which effectively increases the thread diameter to about that of a #14 screw. This allows me to tighten the screw securely and will last much longer than ordinary tape. One more thing: The THICKNESS of the screw head doesn't quite allow the chrome cap to fully snap into place over the nylon ring. The top of the head needs to be filed down a little leaving enough Philips "X" to use the screwdriver. I should have gotten the Honda cap.  This fits OK, but the screws are not "captured" in the cap.  With the original cap,the screws cannot fall out.  Considering the position of the screws when mounting this, captured screws are an advantage. 
I like it, it is inexpensive, do a good job, and check your connections on the same time. Great item. This product is very good but not great. It's their consumer grade polishing glaze and their professional line is really great! A good product at a very reasonable price. Good product!! 
We use these to put color logos on the inside of the plate for display on the front of the vehicle. Back ground can be painted in on the inside of the plate for better contrast. It bothers me when front license plate is screwed directly to the bumper.  Considering the cost of these mounting brackets, I wish manufacturers included them as standard equipment; it would show their attention to detail.When I found Cruiser Accessories 79150 Mounting Plate it seemed like a good value.  I especially liked multiple slots for mounting onto the bumper.  These slots provide a good number of mounting and adjustment options.  I used the upper two vertical slots because they were spaced exactly like the existing holes in my car's front bumper.Unfortunately, there was a couple of frustrating issues that spoiled the experience:1.  Four screws that are included with the plate are too long.  I saw them being long and I am glad I checked for this before installing the mounting plate onto the front bumper.  I used included four screws to attach the license plate and the Black Cruiser Accessories 20050 Classic Lite frame to the mounting plate - screws' sharp tips protruded 1/4" from the back of the mounting plate.  If I had installed the mounting plate onto the bumper first and then tried to attach the license plate with the included screws, I would have damaged the front bumper in two places (the bottom two holes ended up over an air intake slot on my car).  I expect all pieces included with the product to be carefully engineered for that product and working properly.  These screws, obviously, are of the wrong size.  The fact that I had to go to Home Depot to find properly fitting screws not only was frustrating, but also increased the overall cost.2.  The thin pieces of plastic at the top and bottom of the mounting plate are too flimsy.  When I unpacked the plate, these areas of the mounting plate were slightly deformed: bent inwards. Fortunately, the license plate covered the problem.When the mounting plate is installed, it looks nice, so I am not completely disappointed; however, I found a similar product from Bell at Autozone, and it was cheaper (though Bell's mounting plate had very long screws too). THIS IS A STURDY AND INEXPENSIVE LICENSE PLATE HOLDER THAT ALLOWS FOR THE PLATE TO SIT ON THE EDGE OF THE HOLDER BECAUSE OF IT'S DESIGN.  GOOD PRODUCT. 
with plastic bumpers being the norm, thought I'd use this plastic polish.  It brings the shine to the plastic painted areas just like step 2 does to the metal. Truly an impressive assembly of 4 parts. If there is a finer example of a little piece of rubbery roll-y wheel attached to a wooden handle with some metal parts in the middle tying it all together, show me. Does a super job on brass, copper, silver, aluminum, bronze and stainless steel. Polishes most metals to a mirror-like finish. Very similar to Flitz polishing cream. 
We use these to put color logos on the inside of the plate for display on the front of the vehicle. Back ground can be painted in on the inside of the plate for better contrast. This comes with 4 rubber feet that you install on the bottom.  Each foot is circular with a slot running from one side to the other that perfectly fits around the metal grate on top of RV stoves.  The board itself has pre-drilled pilot holes and a template that allows you to determine which holes to use for your particular stove.  It's a very well-done product.  The feet keep the unit in place during travel but it comes off easily when you want to use the stove.  The finish is very nice too so it looks excellent in place.  Highly recommend. THIS IS A STURDY AND INEXPENSIVE LICENSE PLATE HOLDER THAT ALLOWS FOR THE PLATE TO SIT ON THE EDGE OF THE HOLDER BECAUSE OF IT'S DESIGN.  GOOD PRODUCT. 
Great wheel lock that is easy to activate and unlock.  It comes with 3 keys, one of which has a LED light on it.  The product also comes with a reminder cord that attaches to the handle bar as a reminder.  It does just what I was looking for. Primarily:  They do what they are supposed to for my 30 ft. trailer. Work well and easy.Secondarily: They came shipped in their own box, which is weak enough to need an outer box - arrived in pieces, but all metal held up, though scratched.  Needed to be a little less green to package the weight of 4 metal stands. I did not receive what is shown in the picture.  It does not have the two round lids that turn on top, but rather a hinged lid held by two thumb screws.  Doesn't really matter, as it works just the same.  This is a nice cover, and I'm happy with it.  It looks better than the one it replaced. 
It fits perfectly to my 2005 Honda Accord.Filter quality seems to be good. Exactly what was offered, fit nicely, no major prep work, won't fade or crack, adjusts perfectly, easy removal and fits under seat in truck bought this for my 2004 honda crv.  fit perfectly and cleared the code.  easy to do just give the threads some wd40

If there is a finer example of a little piece of rubbery roll-y wheel attached to a wooden handle with some metal parts in the middle tying it all together, show me. This is a reinforced bracket with a plastic coating, very strong feeling when mounted securely.  No flex as I plug in/out of it.  The sockets seem to be likewise, very solid and secure feeling. 
It's okay for OBD stuff and gives some more codes on some models but it is not a replacement for a proper PC based code reader with full model specific software.If I would have done this again I would have bought a cheap net book. You can't say much about this quick disconnect plug. But one for sure: having it installedcharging your motorcycle is much easier than using those old fashioned alligator clamps.If you also interested in buying a battery maintainer the harness is included in this one:&#34;Black & Decker BM3B 6V and 12V Battery Charger / Maintainer&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051D3MP6/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0You may also like to hear that there is a adapter available from SAE-2-USB plug available:&#34;SAE to USB Adapter - Motorcycle Cell Phone Charger&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007VFFQRE/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1So if you also use a navigation system while riding you can easily charge this on the road. If you want a powerful diagnostic device, this is what you are looking for. I have been using other diagnostic devices in the past but there's nothing compared to this because not all error codes show on the dashboard but this scanner brought out one error that other scanners could not detect. Nice buy! 
Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Had to have this product to do the oil changes on my wife's 2009 Toyota Camry 3.5L V-6. Great quality! 
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. This makes it SO easy to charge in conjunction with my battery tender.  So far it has fit all my vehicles batteries ( Acura integra, Toyota Tundra, Toyota Pickup ) Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. 
I have installed a transmission cooler in my FJ Cruiser and use this scan tool/gauge to monitor the transmission temperatures in the pan and at the converter control valve sensor. Having the rig set up for towing, this product is a very valuable asset, plus you can watch various other parameters and sensor reading, MPG`s, etc etc and use it also as a scan tool...Excellent product! Perfect fit for rear window on my 2004 Ford Excursion Limited. Easy to install. No spotting seen or squeaking at all It works and the support staff at Linear Logic are helpful if you have any issues.  My local shop suspected that I have a bad O2 sensor that wasn't being flagged by the on-board computer.  With the ScanGauge, I programmed in codes for fuel trim, O2 sensors, and air/fuel ratio and can see that it all looks ok.  Saved $100+ in diagnosis charges and I can monitor the readings as I drive. 
Now we  do not have to move it  from car to car. These units work well and are accurate. Recommend one for all your vehicles. As title states, purchased for my wifes 2010 NIssan Rogue. Can never be prepared enough when it comes to families and the vehicles we drive. Opened up package and turned on car, plugged it in to make sure it works. BAM... Does just what it was intended to do. Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. 
The tool appears to be of average quality.  However, I returned it to Amazon since it did not fit up to a Ford Taurus flex fuel engine.  This type of engine requires a special fitting that this tool does not have. Works great, nice to have a second cable, but the OBD end of the cable is angled.  In my case, this cable won't work on my Subaru Outback.  I would prefer the option of a straight OBD connector.  Note that the angle connector works on my other four cars (Mazda, Honda, Dodge). Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators.

I have been using other diagnostic devices in the past but there's nothing compared to this because not all error codes show on the dashboard but this scanner brought out one error that other scanners could not detect. Nice buy! I found a Ford 6.0L diesel priced so low I couldn't pass, and, I knew beforehand it'd require certain upgrades to instill natural diesel longevity and I needed a tool to help - enter Scangauge II.Scangauge II has features beyond a simple scan tool, eg Trip Computer (Miles per Gallon; Tank-to-Empty; Cost per Trip), Horsepower, -Mile Time, 0-60mph WOTs, Stopping Distance and others...Neat features but not reason I purchased...Digital Gauges (reason): the Mfr refers to this feature as "X-Gauge"- Screen displays four real-time On-board diagnostics Parameter Identifications (OBDII PIDs) of user choosing- PIDs displayed can be changed via pressing adjacent buttons- Performance Data (MPG, Qtr Mile Time etc) may be displayed together/alongside PIDs- Displays vehicle mfr generic PIDs automatically (gasoline engine)- Displays diesel mfr PIDs (ie EOT, ICT, IPR etc) after user creates an 'x-gauge' by input data from Scangauge websiteWith basic knowledge and study I use this gadget to my advantage, I mean either repair vehicle myself, or, know what's wrong (exactly what's broken) beforehand, to preclude somename repair shop ripping me off - it's way too common.I think it comes ready to troubleshoot gasoline engines, in general, yet I'd to enter math data (avail on website) manually for it to sense and display PIDs unique to diesel.After several days of study/application, my opinion is this tool will help diagnose with near certainty, components which have failed and components in early stage of failure.  Its ability to depict four PIDs simultaneously in real-time allows comparison between what related PIDs reflect per desired and actual.Also note I found most big name Tuners boasting scan ability do not monitor/depict many key PIDs as Scangauge, a huge shortcoming for tuner price.Simply put, the Scangauge II is much more than an OBDII code reader and, it'll be difficult/near impossible to find an item offering same diagnostic capabilities for both gas and diesel engines at price.Update Jan 2014: I've purchased another for my Boy's pickup with a 7.3L.  We both have SCT Livewire 9600 Tuners but due to Livewire 9600's monitoring limitations we have Scangauges connected full time to monitor key PIDs.Kyle It's okay for OBD stuff and gives some more codes on some models but it is not a replacement for a proper PC based code reader with full model specific software.If I would have done this again I would have bought a cheap net book.

Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.  The pickle fork is the last resort for me, as it will damage the balljoint boot.I prefer to use the Snap On balljoint remover.  If that one cannot fit, then I will try this tool.  If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork. The product works very well based upon condition of your interior. It will not make your car new, but it does work. Hope this helps.

So, I can't comment on how well it works.  The main reason for this review is to put it out there that it does not work with a 2000 Chevy Silverado.  The siphon tube does not fit thru the bottom of the dip stick tube.  It would be really nice if Mityvac had a published list of what vehicles it works with and what ones it does not.  I have my fingers crossed that it'll work with my jet ski, otherwise there will be a new/(un)used Mityvac on *****'slist.  Long story short, do your research to see if you can confirm or deny if it will work with your vehicle before you buy it. 
Did not fit my car's filter harness after Amazon's compatibility tool said it would, there was a 1.5&#34; gap compared to the OEM filter, I have a 2006 Honda Civic Si - steer clear of this if you own the same car It fits perfectly to my 2005 Honda Accord.Filter quality seems to be good. I ordered this for replacement from oem gas cap and it fit very good on my Honda with great success 
As title states, purchased for my wifes 2010 NIssan Rogue. Can never be prepared enough when it comes to families and the vehicles we drive. Opened up package and turned on car, plugged it in to make sure it works. BAM... Does just what it was intended to do. This product does not fit your 2012 Toyota Tacoma! That's according to Amazon.YES, IT DOES FIT MY 2012 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab.I don't know what that white powder is on the rubber seal, but I cleaned it before installing the cap.  No error codes and no gas stolen so far. First of all, this was shipped in its original sales box all taped up, and that is it.  Was shocked to see the poor excuse of shipping method, but I guess you really cannot break this thing simply by shipping it.Installed on a 7K lb travel trailer, works pretty good, but did not elliminate all the sway.  Part of it is because I am towing with a large SUV that is really a little small framed for towing this size camper, even though the RV Dealers will say it is a perfect fit as does the tow vehicle manujfacturer.Sold the SUV and bought a big boy truck to tow with, and what a difference.  I don't even need this anymore, as the bigger tow vehicle makes all the difference.BTW, DO NOT back up with this connected to the tow vehicle and trailer, you will bend it faster that you installed it. 
Very good product.  Now my wife can pull into the garage without backing up and maneuvering her car to get it right.  Easy to install.  As a point of reference for her, I put a small &#34;cupboard door&#34; disc on the dash.  When we pull the car in all she needs to do is get the light to be within an inch of the &#34;cupboard door&#34; disc on the dash 360 degrees and the car is parked perfect.  Our garage is a 3 car one, but with my car, motor cycle, large mower, tools, tool chest, garbage cans, lawn equipment, wall cabinets,  etc....we need to make sure we manage the space.  And now we have more space. Dynamat is great, it's the original, you can't go wrong. I'm strictly using for door panels on both vehicles as I upgrade their stereo systems completely.  But I plan to put this on the floor of my truck as well, under the carpet. I tower out at 5'7&#34; which is not considered tall when it comes to working on or retrieving items from the bed of my 4x4 truck. This came in a nice carrying case that stores well behind the front seats in my truck without scratching anything. I have put on the front tire trying out the fit and it will work well . 
Great to protect the edges of your Car Doors in the garage, from bumping the wall & scuffing the paint off the edges. I need to buy another pack though, for the back doors protection too, as it is not long enough for both doors. We don't need it for the back doors very often, but I think it will come in handy at times. Since we like this so much, we will be buying another. Very good product.  Now my wife can pull into the garage without backing up and maneuvering her car to get it right.  Easy to install.  As a point of reference for her, I put a small &#34;cupboard door&#34; disc on the dash.

And now we have more space. The provided foam spacers and fit was perfect on my 2013 JEEP OEM hitch receiver.  Sturdy and well made.  The one I received had round corners so I did not have to 'modify' it as some other's stated they had to do.  I will not leave this permanently in my hitch and the weather, since there is potential for moisture to get into it.  If you put keys in this I'd suggest a zip log bag.  There are two holes in the back of the unit which I suspect is to allow moisture to escape, I thought about using Silicone RTV to close those up, but decided against it.  Weather, and especially near coastal areas, will probably corrode the combo lock at some point so I will not leave it permanently installed, and will keep in my cab until I need it. 
This is a nice product to have if you dont want to pay for your car to get detailed.  I like the ease of using this Powerball by just pairing it with my drill.  No cords and i can easilly maneuver it.  Cheap alternative if you dont want to do manual waxing.  I love the result and i enjoy cleaning my car.  This product work as expected and it comes with a free wax too. I think I would have expected better instructions for a USA made product. However, there is a lot of available information on the internet and at other vendor websites, so the installation is very straightforward, simple even. I like the small profile and display options. You would also think that technology today would burn in the settings so that you do not need to keep the unit energized continuously. I do not drive my truck for weeks and I will not leave something that draws milliamps connected so I have to disconnect this when not in use. That was not clear in anything I read about it. It fits perfectly and it is inexpensive, what more do you need? Good for the do it yourself oil changer. I installed on a 2003 4Runner. 
I bought this for my 99 ford escort lx sedan, so I could hear my sony stereo more. I followed the instructions and applied the product to my front doors. I have noticed a difference in the sound quality of my speakers. I can hear them more and there's less vibration on the doors. As far as road noise goes, it helped just a little. This product isn't made to reduce the road noise, just to help get rid of vibrations and make your stereo system louder and easier to hear on the road. The road noise level is still the same in my car. Works great, installed it on my motorcycle and also kept the high tone stock horn.  With both horns the sound is VERY loud, it will scare the crap out of any dummies that pull out in front of me now.85db stock horn91db stock horn + FiammIf you understand how decibel measurement works you will know that is a big increase in sound. I beleave I can really feel the difference in the power in the car can't tell the difference in mileage yet . The engine is quieter and smother running . Yes I would recommend this oil to all my friends.Paul 
I have an FJ Cruiser.  It's not a quiet vehicle.  I accept that.I have been working on upgrading my stereo system - replaced the head unit, put in 6x9 speakers in the doors, etc.  Well, the 6x9s are much more responsive than the stock speakers were, especially in the lower frequencies.  So, I developed a buzz.  I bought the Dynamat to see if I could get rid of that, after I tightened everything that I could find.Installation was easier than I feared - thanks for the tennis ball tip, BTW!  As far as the real results, though, I'm not sure that I've noticed a real difference in sound quality, noise, or heat.  Perhaps some.  The rattling has reduced, but not eliminated.Does the product work?  Possibly.  It's hard for me to say either way. I mounted these behind the front grill whereas the original single horn was in the engine compartment.  It is an improvement on the sound level but not as much as I expected.  I did use the provided relay and ran 12 gauge wiring (original was somewhere between 14-16 gauge) that did not rely on the original horn wiring.The horns are well made and I expect them to last the life of the vehicle.  I only gave them 3 stars though because the sound is not the ear splitting &#34;wake up and pay attention to what you are doing&#34; volume that I was expecting.  So even though I will keep them I will probably be looking for something that is even louder. HI.............THIS HAS BEEN AN INTERESTING PURCHASE FOR ME......FIRST I SHOULD SAY THAT RED LINE PRODUCTS ARE THE HIGHEST QUALITY YOU CAN PUT IN YOUR CAR.....THERE ARE A FEW OTHERS OUT THERE....IAM USING....TRANSMISSION,,,,POWER STERING,,,AND BRAKE FLUID.....FOR MOTOR OIL I USE MOBIL 1 OR PENNZOIL ULTRA.....IAM SURE RED LINE OIL IS JUST AS GOOD......WHEN I CHANGED ALL MY FLUIDS WHEN I GOT MY CAR I NOTICED IMPROVEMENTS RIGHT AWAY....THE STEERING FELT BETTER AND THE TRANSMISSION WAS SHIFTING BETTER.....MY CAR GAS MILLAGE IS 21 TO 29....I CAN DO 31 ON THE HIGHWAY WITH CRUISE CONTROL ON....BACK TO THE WATER WETTER.....I HAVE NO IDEA IF ITS WORKING OR NOT....MY TEMP GAUGE GOES TO THE SAME PLACE AND I DONT KNOW WHAT ITS DOING IN MY RADIATOR.....NOTHING BAD IS HAPPENING BUT I BOUGHT IT BECAUSE OF THE PRICE AND THE NAME ON THE LABEL....I HAD $10 TO SPEND....RED LINE ROCKS.....IF YOU READ THE TECHNOLOGY I WOULD SAY IT MAKES SENSE BUT DONT EXPECT TO SEE A RESULT.....I TRUST THE NAME....RACE TESTED PRODUCTS........JOEY 
Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!! Dynamat is great, it's the original, you can't go wrong. I'm strictly using for door panels on both vehicles as I upgrade their stereo systems completely.  But I plan to put this on the floor of my truck as well, under the carpet. Looks and fits the same for a 2000 Toyota Sienna van. I ordered extra so I will not be without any at a later date. 
Its a tire gauge that is pretty basic to use. You insert the metal pin into the tire tread gap and the rear part tells you the depth. Walk around the vehicle and check all the tires. If the front tires are worn more than the rear, its time to rotate the front tires to the rear. The pair of levels are a great value.  I recently purchased these for a second time, as the originals were sold with my previous trailer and I wanted to make my new trailer easier to get on a level stance.There really isn't much to go wrong as far as product failure is concerned.  Accuracy is up to you with the initial installation.Recommended method of installation is to get your trailer level/RV, front to back, and side to side.  Once you have your trailer true, install the graduated levels in locations which will show you front to back level (placed on the side of the trailer) and side to side (place on the front or back of the trailer).  Make sure the bubble indicates "level" by being in the center point of the tube.Installation should be done once all your components are "stressed" as they will be for trailer/RV use (I.E. front tongue on a travel trailer, all the normal weight sitting on the winch foot, or in the case of 5th wheels/motorcoaches, landing gear down), try to place the levels on the RV in clear view of the winch/landing gear controls to enable leveling without having to relocate to a different location to view the levels.I accomplished this on a travel trailer by placing one level on the very front center, and the other on the side of the frame tongue close to the winch.  Though small, with sharp eye-sight, you can take advantage of the one on the front of the trailer as you position the trailer to see if you can establish a level side to side stance as you near your desired location.On my 5th wheel, my landing gear controls are on the front corner of the main body.  I placed one on the side of the rig for front to back level, and another right around the corner on the front side (for side to side level) still within sight of the controls, as well as from the truck cab for backing up.  Even though the level is off center, if it is installed properly with the trailer level at the time of installation, it will work fine.As far as the graduated scales are concerned, you will have to find your "scale" for adjustments, as it depends on where the levels are placed in reference to the center of the pivot points.The levels come with a self adhesive foam strip on the back for placement as well as two holes for screws if you wish to drill holes in the side of your rig.  I go with the adhesive strip route, as I don't like unnecessary holes.  The only negative with the adhesive strips is they will flex if stressed and it can put the levels off level, though this only happened to me with the first pair after the foam tape aged a few years.One last comment . . .the green bubble tube will fade from extended UV exposure.  It will not interfere with the accuracy, just makes it a little harder to read.If you are looking for larger levels which can be read from a distance, I know they are out there, but I have no experience with them to make a comparison.  I do not wish to clutter the appearance of the rig with large levels. This device attaches securely to the tow vehicle, but at a cost.They are cumbersome to attach and detach, with several moving parts and the potential to scratch the tow vehicle paint during either process if you don't have three hands available.To attain the secure vibration free fit, you must crank down on the ratcheted web strap hard enough to deform the door where it attaches to the window channel. It also deforms the rubber window seal.Foam pads protect the door somewhat where the bracket would otherwise rub on the body, but if the area isn't meticulously clean beforehand I can see where it would dull the paint over time.Because of the metal claw part that fits into the window channel, raising and lowering the window caused a screeching sound on my driver's side window.Finally, when they are detached from the door, they make for a very bulky awkward device that doesn't store conveniently or compactly in the vehicle.I'm sending them back. 
this is my second review of this product since i bought one for my car and my wifes car. You got to be nuts if you let the dealer charge you $90.00 for a replacement filter that is of lesser quality. it takes 5 min to install. most are installed behind the glovebox. These wipers do what they are supposed to do... Clear the window of liquid debris.  I would give the wipers about 4 stars cause I have noticed from time to time not the best performance but overall very good.This review actually comes in mostly due to the amazing customer service I received from Valeo.  When I was picking up one of my wiper blades, the plastic piece fell apart rendering the wiper blade utterly useless. I decided to search reviews on amazon to see if anyone else had the problem.  I found another review like mine and that reviewer said that they e-mailed the company and got replacement plastic clips.So I decided to e-mail the company and Watkins Devane replied back with in about 20 minutes.  After supplying my car information and model number of the wiper blade I had issues with, I was sent replacement parts that arrived in about 2 days.  Installed new clip and wiper works great again.Just a tip, if you plan on e-mailing the company with an issue like this, provide your car make, model, and year along with the wiper blade model number to expedite the process. According to the selection process, it showed that this product fits my car. I have had trouble making this fit for my car. Again, with all my reviews, I research more than the average person and thus far I had to put the old wiper blades back on my car - sorry.... I hate giving bad reviews, but this is what I feel. 
Installed in my IS 350. Could have used another few square feet, but it is easy to install once you remove all the carpet, spare tire and rear deck lid factory insulation. Don't forget the license plate and fuel door. Very small cars only. SUV or truck or large car tires do not fit well between the ridges and deform the product. I fastened the mat down with 4 tapcon concrete screws, each 2 inches long, into my garage slab. The leading edge of the mat tore off the screws and folded up. The adhesive strip behind the mat was also useless. I would have had better result with a 2 x 4 piece of fir or pine and concrete screwing it to the garage slab. You also have to aim the car perfectly when you park it because the mat is only as wide as the tire. I can't return it because it's damaged from use due to faulty design. Wasted my money. I use it everyday primarily for a storage cover.  I have not had the cover on the bike in rain or weather.  I got the XL for my CBR500R with full large rear bags and windshield.  I can lock my helmet to the rear seat area put the cover on and it will cover up the entire bikes exhaust and 3/4 of the rear tire and entire front tire.  Two bungies mid bike and front tire enable hokking cover under bike.  Very sturdy and breathable with exhaust panels (silver durable material) and inner windshield liner.  Much bang for the buck. Would certainly purchase another if I had to without question. 
Very good product.  Now my wife can pull into the garage without backing up and maneuvering her car to get it right.  Easy to install.  As a point of reference for her, I put a small &#34;cupboard door&#34; disc on the dash.  When we pull the car in all she needs to do is get the light to be within an inch of the &#34;cupboard door&#34; disc on the dash 360 degrees and the car is parked perfect.  Our garage is a 3 car one, but with my car, motor cycle, large mower, tools, tool chest, garbage cans, lawn equipment, wall cabinets,  etc....we need to make sure we manage the space.  And now we have more space. when I park for awhile or need to take my Engel refrigerator/freezer in my car into the house or hotel room, this does the trick of keeping it powered up. So far working really well.  stuck them to the ground and now the wife can park her car and leave walking room in front.  I just worry that if these every move she will drive right into our kitchen. 
Even though Amazon says it does not fit my truck; it does fit my 2002 Chevrolet 2500HD crew cab with 6.0L gas engine. I replaced both sensors and harness. Both sensors were rough looking and the rear sensor had standing water on it. It was a little bit of a chore to get to them because you have to remove the intake but it was not too bad. This is an excellent product.  It really works best with Mercedes and BMWs where they also have the oil filter on the top of the car so you dont even need to get under the car to remove the oil filter.  Ive also used this on my Audi, which it works fine, but you still need to get under it to get the oil filter out.Also should point out, this wont work on some domestics because the way they snake their dipsticks into the oil pan.  Clear example is the Dodge Ram 04.  It comes with a tubing small enough to fit practically any car, but the dipstick on this truck snakes through to major curves so didnt work on that car.But I can say it will work for almost any import or german car.Dixit I purchased this belt for my 2003 Chevy Tahoe. I had no idea Chevy would put 2 serpentines on a newer generation vehicle. This smaller belt fits the A/C system only. It works like a champ and fits perfectly. I would recommend the Gatorback belts to EVERYONE! As an installation side note, you have to remove the air intake and larger serpentine to get to this "bottom of the motor" mounted unit.... way to engineer that one GM! 
This helped tremendously to silence the water pump on my Jayco fifth wheel. Jayco had originally mounted PEX tubing directly to the pump so any vibration was transmitted directly into the walls. These flexible hoses help to reduce the amount of vibration transmitted. Though it does still get loud when its cold and the hoses stiffen. These hoses are quite long (about 20&#34;) so pay attention to available space. Its nice to not have water usage wake everyone up in the middle of the night! This is a high quality motor oil that reduces engine heat and doesn't have wax in it's ingredients oil like conventional oil does. I like using this in my tractor because it's air cooled and gets very hot. This oil is used on performance engines for a good reason and that is because it won't break down at low or high temperatures and the synthetic will bond with the metal and reduce friction. Airaid intake tube thought I would give it a try, not expensive compared to other intake tubes.  gave my 6.0 truck a boost in performance.  it will add that throaty noise to your engine when you put your foot down. 
I use these on all my vehicles, from my 1930 Model A (6 volt version) to my quad and my '07 Silverado. They are very easy to install and should be used on any vehicle that sits for over a month at a time. I have nothing bad to say about them. Every one I have came with two sets of leads, and makes it very nice for multiple vehicles. I own both a travel trailer and a sailboat, so needed a method to check battery condition as well as charging ability of my truck's system.  This unit addresses both needs.  I was surprised at how large and heavily constructed it was, but am pleased at its obvious durability. There was some confusion on my part initially on how to read one of the scales, and feel they could do a little better in explaining that. But, it's easy to figure out once connected to a battery.  Simple and straight-forward to use, no college degree or inch-thick operating manual required.  Just hook up and read.  Purchase with confidence. This item is great if you have multiple adapters and need to use the cigarette for charging items for those in the back seat. I have two ports and the extension is used for one of them. 
I use it on a 17 foot Boston Whaler.  I connected it directly to the battery so I can use spot lights, other lighting, charge cell phones, etc.  Can't get any simpler.  Basically a piece of useful junk.  Recommend it. 7 Prong connector is the best for use in any towing situation even if you only need a flat 4 lead connection.  This unit is well used on rigs where you may run into many towed vehicle applications that do not match the 7 pole set up.  4 pole is at the ready if you need it. I bought this converter so as to use my &#34;Snap&#34; sat radio in my truck in the garage. The snap radio is used in the 12v power supply in my truck and to be able to use elsewhere I decided to try this out. Plus if need be it can be used as a cell phone charger. I have not used it enough to comment on quality but I have 2 other Schumacher products that are high quality. I see no reason why this product would be any different. 
Just received the tail bag and it looks to be of good quality workmanship. I was surprised to find out it had a rain cover that also doubled as a safety reflector. You can never have too many visibility features on a motorcycle! It comes in a nice box and the instructions on how to install are clear. I have some soft-sided sport bags on my bike already but I'm considering getting the matching set for this tail bag to make it all look cohesive and to take advantage of its built-in compatibility with this unit. Nice Cordura material which should keep my stuff safe and dry for the most part. It's big enough for a shaving kit, some underwear, spare gloves, etc. This thing has 2 readouts and 4 scales and no instructions on how to read any of htem.  The SWR is easy enough to figure out but the others are anyones guess, came with some little wire antenna that is nowhere in the one sheet instruction that comes with it.  The signal strength meter dosn't seem to register at all.  It was cheap enough and probelly works, but your  have to find an engineer to tell you how to use it. Although it looks to be made with a thick sturdy plastic shell, mine came misaligned. I had to unscrew it and reset the 2 halves together. Functionally, everything seems to work but time will only tell how it will hold up. Also the company logo peels off pretty easily. 
This high temp paint made an old BBQ grill almost like new.The high temp paint handles my electric grill temps nicely. Copper Anti-Seize is a higher temperature version of the old grey product.  It doesn't dry out as fast as the original.  If higher temperatures are to be encountered go with the nickel Anti-Seize. I have a automatic standby generator for my home and in northern Michigan the temps can really get extremely low, like way below 0 My generator has had trouble starting in these severe climates. the specs call for SAE 5-30 I use this SAE 0-20 and it has no problem firing up in these cold temps. 
CHEEP My last same-sized container anti-seize, standing at attention, lasting me 30 years (home use), so my children will finish this one.About it:It's silver in color, 8-oz. container (a bunch), -65F - 1600F, Anti-Seize, -Corrosion and -Galling; has Lid Brush; label indicates "Made in USA".Specific Use: Ease assembly and disassembly of hardware which experience extreme temperatures and/or corrosive conditions.I've used this routinely, and sparingly for it does not take much - just a light swipe on threads, mating surfaces etc.  Most of my last container went to lubricating boat and boat engine components for very good saltwater corrosion prevention.A general caution is: not apply to business end of sparkplug, O2 sensor etc (lightly on threads/sealing surface only) - else could impact component performance (never seen it happen lol).*UPDATE: I visited Permatex website - wished I'd done so earlier ... A summary:From Website Technical Data Sheets (TDS),This Permatex (80078) has ingredients of "aluminum, copper and graphite lubricants ... meets or exceed requirements of Mil Spec Mil-A-907E."Temperature Range: "-51F to 1600F"Flash: ">350F"TDS Applications: "Sparkplug threads, Exhaust & Engine Hardware, Brake Assemblies, Boilers, Ovens, Jet Engines and Turbines.", and does refer to a "Marine" use.Permatex Copper:  This may be a preferred product due to seemingly inherent do-all capability: Dielectric grease, anti-seize, anti-corrosion to include mating surfaces of dissimilar metals.

The horrible ethanol we are forced to purchasing as part of our gas absorbs water and can damage engines. Sta-Bil is designed to help prevent this from occurring. 
Works like crap. Does not allow enough air in to blow lines out. Save your money and use an air nozzle instead. Trust me! Does what it exactly is suppose to do. One of the bottles cleans the air filter and once the air filter has dried, the other bottle lubricates the filter for the next use. Would recommend In my 2001 Silverado installation was easy,fit perfect and pleats in filter were thicker than plain filter i took out. Airflow was not affected but noticed less dust buildup on dash and less odour with the FRAM FRESH BREEZE!!  You should change your cabin air  filter twice a year for fresh clean air and to protect your heat and air conditioning system! Great for people with allergies to dust and pollen. Will definitely buy again!! 
I got this to go along with my 12volt air compressor I got. I'll carry it in my atv in case I run across any situation that I may need it. It's heavy duty made so it shouldn't build up to much heat when in continuous use. A few years ago I purchased a cheaper air compressor here, and it is a very heavy little unit and works well. This unit also works well but is very lightweight for what it is. I'm not sure that the construction will hold up over an extended period of use and hauling.If you were just going to put this in the car trunk in case of emergency, then it would probably work fine, and I'm sure that is the target demographic....casual users and individuals who need to inflate balls, air mattresses, etc. For these buyers, the digital display and light is also a perk for easy use and emergency kits.If you regularly use an air compressor or are a bit rough with your "tools," you might want to take a pass and opt for a unit with meatier construction. These can save you time and frustration while camping. If you spring a leak use one of these. I bought these to quiet a pump, but I found it was not needed for that. I had purchased an accumulator tank and it came with a very short connector so I used one of these and have the other for an emergency. It makes sense how it would dampen sound. RV's have little space to work in so one is a handy spare water-connector that is easy to finger tighten. Recommended. 
Wow, this stuff works well!  We have a wall air conditioner in our home.  It is a quiet variety that we paid a good deal of money for, due to that claim.  It still had a bad resonance of some vibrating metal on the machine.I applied this to all accessible (front face) surfaces, and only the spots where there was not a decal or other item present, probably less than 30% of the total frontal surface (keep in mind 50% is the evaporator and blower vent), and the available space on the front cover.  Wow, we can definitely hear a difference in the room it is installed in.This thing has a strong resonance, so we can still hear it in other spaces.  I feel like it doesnt dampen all modes, but it certainly does enough for a noticeable difference in the space where we have the AC located. I bought about 10 boxs for my PT. The top of my PT would make a flutering sound when driving, not no more. Also road sounds dimed down some. When it rains, the top of my PT doesn't sound like a tin can anymore.... This product does not seem like much to look at but when used at night,it is very effective and easy to see.I always place mineLED lights in an area of my car that is not to obvious. I would not place on the dashboard but perhaps on the side of my console orin a storage area in the dashboard. It can be a deterrent to car thefts. 
I use it everyday primarily for a storage cover.  I have not had the cover on the bike in rain or weather.  I got the XL for my CBR500R with full large rear bags and windshield.  I can lock my helmet to the rear seat area put the cover on and it will cover up the entire bikes exhaust and 3/4 of the rear tire and entire front tire.  Two bungies mid bike and front tire enable hokking cover under bike.  Very sturdy and breathable with exhaust panels (silver durable material) and inner windshield liner.  Much bang for the buck. Would certainly purchase another if I had to without question. I was originally going to get one of the small squares to go behind my newly installed speakers but after comparing the price per square foot, I decided to tackle a box of this stuff. A box let me cover four doors and my roof in my subaru wrx wagon.This car is my first non Mercedes in 15 years and although the subaru is still an econo box, this made the stereo sound way better, reduced road noise and give the car a more &#34; luxury&#34; feel. Well worth the price and effort to install. I use this on the back window of my Jeep Grand Cherokee. It does not flex enough to have full contact on the window. It only has about 8&#34; of contact. I will not purchase this again.

Would certainly purchase another if I had to without question. I tower out at 5'7&#34; which is not considered tall when it comes to working on or retrieving items from the bed of my 4x4 truck. This came in a nice carrying case that stores well behind the front seats in my truck without scratching anything. I have put on the front tire trying out the fit and it will work well . I got them for my Camry and they are perfect fit for front or rear seat head rests.Convenient to carry shirts from laundry, hang umbrella, wife's purse and grocery bags. 
Rain-X makes terrible wipers, but you don't need them if you put enough of this on.Tip: don't put it on the side windows, unless you want all the rainwater rushing up into your car whenever you crack them open. Nice cover and much better then the one that came with my Hybrid RV. Allows you to get to the valves from the top which is really nice if you have a Hybrid where the front bed is above the LP tanks so if you need to get to your tanks you won't have to put the pop-out beds back in just to lift the cover off the LP tanks. The top opening lid isn't going anywhere like someone posted here that they lost it on the road. If you close it like you should it locks in place and is very secure... no way could it come off and get lost. I Ordered Polar white and thats what I received and matches the old one. Trivia:  You can't have a sewer hose on the ground in Oregon.  It must be elevated!Betcha didn't know that, but what the heck!  It's always nice to have your "stuff" run downhill into the dump station instead of just sitting there in the hose!  Some people (Joe Flatlanders) carry a rain gutter to accomplish the same thing, but is a rain gutter collapsible into a nice little package with a handle?Word to the wise:  NEVER leave you black tank gate valve open!  It's ok to leave your gray tank open but NEVER leave your blank tank valve open! 
I have a Marantz DC garage door opener and it's is very quiet, but the noise from the garage door moving on the tracks was driving me crazy.  After WD40 and other lubricants didn't work, got the CRC White Lithium grease and applied it.  The noise was reduced to a bare minimum.  A must have if you have a garage.  I have also used this on door hinges, van sliding door, etc.  Works great!! We got these to put on the RV doors.  We used one for door and they really work.  No more having to slam it shut as the springs brings the door into a closed position. I bought this for my 99 ford escort lx sedan, so I could hear my sony stereo more. I followed the instructions and applied the product to my front doors. I have noticed a difference in the sound quality of my speakers. I can hear them more and there's less vibration on the doors. As far as road noise goes, it helped just a little. This product isn't made to reduce the road noise, just to help get rid of vibrations and make your stereo system louder and easier to hear on the road. The road noise level is still the same in my car. 
CHEEP My last same-sized container anti-seize, standing at attention, lasting me 30 years (home use), so my children will finish this one.About it:It's silver in color, 8-oz. container (a bunch), -65F - 1600F, Anti-Seize, -Corrosion and -Galling; has Lid Brush; label indicates "Made in USA".Specific Use: Ease assembly and disassembly of hardware which experience extreme temperatures and/or corrosive conditions.I've used this routinely, and sparingly for it does not take much - just a light swipe on threads, mating surfaces etc.  Most of my last container went to lubricating boat and boat engine components for very good saltwater corrosion prevention.A general caution is: not apply to business end of sparkplug, O2 sensor etc (lightly on threads/sealing surface only) - else could impact component performance (never seen it happen lol).*UPDATE: I visited Permatex website - wished I'd done so earlier ... A summary:From Website Technical Data Sheets (TDS),This Permatex (80078) has ingredients of "aluminum, copper and graphite lubricants ... meets or exceed requirements of Mil Spec Mil-A-907E."Temperature Range: "-51F to 1600F"Flash: ">350F"TDS Applications: "Sparkplug threads, Exhaust & Engine Hardware, Brake Assemblies, Boilers, Ovens, Jet Engines and Turbines.", and does refer to a "Marine" use.Permatex Copper:  This may be a preferred product due to seemingly inherent do-all capability: Dielectric grease, anti-seize, anti-corrosion to include mating surfaces of dissimilar metals.

The horrible ethanol we are forced to purchasing as part of our gas absorbs water and can damage engines. Sta-Bil is designed to help prevent this from occurring. 
GLAD  I  WENT  WITH  THE  CHROME AND  NOT  THE BLACK ONE, I  HOOKED  THIS ONE UP TO  MY GV1400 MOTORCYCLE IF  YOU  HAVE JUST  A  LITTLE  KNOW  HOW YOU CAN  DO  IT YOUR SELF , ALL  YOU WILL NEED TO GO WITH THIS IS A RELAY THAT DOES NOT COME WITH IT. YOU  CAN  GET IT ON HERE OR ANY PART STORE, I  HAVE MADE MANY PEOPLE JUMP  DUE  TO THE SOUND OF  THE  HORNS  LOUDNESS. I got it quickly it looks good can not wait to use it as soon as I can go out side . I was a touch skeptical. But I can afford to throw it out if I don't like it.  Well I can say, I will NOT be throwing this out!  I was so impressed with how my cars looked when I was done that I had to ask my self. Why didn't I buy this sooner. And it is true. A little goes a long way. 
Very quick and easy mounting and really adds to the look of the rear of the Jeep.  These are metal and not a cheap plastic and mount with included screws into the existing lens cover screw holes. Easy to install. I used my own screws because of the material that I was mounting the bracket on. I had to tape one of the light adapter plugs as it was a loose fit in the bracket. Very strong adhesive backing and perfect fit.  I'm glad that no drilling was required to attach to the door entry. 
I had higher hopes for this, but for the cost, I guess I shouldn't have.Unit is light - about the weight of a candy bar is how it feels in your hands.  The cutter has a horrible entry angle, you'd think in an emergency your tendency while using this would be to pull straight up, but this is angled at more of a 45 degree angle so that won't work quite as well - things have a habit of getting caught and folding over with my testing.But the mount - oh my, it's just horrible. In every respect.  There's a little sheet inside that recommends using sticky backed velcro to mount it.  But the back is hollowed, with just a few thin lines of plastic that the velcro sticky side could even stick to - no way there's nearly enough surface contact for that to be even remotely feasible.  There are screw mounts, but not many people want to drill screws through their cars interior.  Then it's a really tight pull to get this thing out of it.  Hardly what I'd want to have to deal with in an emergency, trying to pull this out, having the whole thing come out because the velcro sticky back couldn't adhere to the base at all.  Then trying to pull this out of the base while I'm fumbling to pull both sides apart from each other, while theoretically in an emergency situation in which I may be in a deadly situation, or addled because of an impact or airbag deployment...Going to look for a better solution, since this one clearly is not it. I receive the unit with a black power adapter not white color like the picture show. But no big deal!It comes with all mounting screws and 2 stripes of foam double side tapes. I will not use these tapes, these are some cheap foam type. I don't think it will hold for long. I use black 3M heavy duty exterior double side tape for mounting. I did not use screws because I mount the laser unit underneath the garage door opener. for ceiling mount screw is still the best! I use heat gun to warm up the these tape for mounting, it works like a glue!This unit comes with a mounting bracket, first you have to mount the bracket than hook the laser unit onto the bracket. however the laser unit is not secure on the bracket. It can come loose very easy! which mean it can fall onto your car. So, I add an electric tape at the back of the unit, now the unit stays!The red laser is bright and clear, it can be see clearly in day light. the laser will turns on and stay on about 2 to 3 minutes.9V battery for power outage backup is also a great feature!Great buy! I had to pry off some car interior trim in order to work on the radio.  The seams were very tight so I knew I needed a better tool than a flat head screwdriver with some tape wrapped around it.  These tools are smooth, strong and didn't mar any parts of the car. 
Valterra is known for quality RV products and accessories, this is no exception. Shipping was on time and product was exactly what I was expecting. The product is just as pictured and seems to be a quality tool.  It's a gap gauge; what more do you want? The Tender Jr. does not come with a cigarette adapter so I cut this in half to make two. I purchased 2 lighter plugs for a buck each from China&#8230; with free shipping&#8230; and they are working fine. These aren&#8217;t an exact match with the Tender cables but they fit together OK and are easy to determine polarity with the wire colors. You can also just use this as an extension cord for your Tender. The description states a length of 12-inches&#8230; but it&#8217;s actually 14-inches tip-to-tip on the connectors. Nice item for the price and it&#8217;s made in Mexico. 
Have not yet needed to use them, bought them for when I do need them. I am however, very impressed with the quality of the cables. The bag they came in is durable, handy, convenient & good quality. The price was outstanding for these cables. They are low profile to ensure that they do not rub on the wheel well. Only issue I had, was attempting to purchase another set of the rubber tensioner in case one breaks. Amazon did not seem to offer more than one size, which of course was not the size I needed. Most reviews caution you to have an extra, or you could find yourself in trouble if one side breaks. So if anyone knows where to buy extra tensioners, please let me know. These are great.  In my first manual tire change I used these and I'm thankfull I have them.  They are very strong, easy to use and grip.  The size and shape was perfect.  Overall pretty basic and not much more to say other than if you need tire spoons, these are a very good deal -- you won't go wrong.  Highly recommend these. These do not have the stackable banana plugs as pictured from Amazon.com.  You need to view the customer's pictures to see how these look.The build quality is cheap.  The quality of the wires itself is not as flexible as DMM test leads.  I use these on a bench power supply.  I will never use these on a DMM.If you plan on using these on a DMM, I would highly recommend you buy some Fluke test leads. 
i use this lube all around the house....door hinges, oven hinges, key locks, sliding door tracks etc.works nicely and doesnt leave a visual layer....dries invisible Installed in my IS 350. Could have used another few square feet, but it is easy to install once you remove all the carpet, spare tire and rear deck lid factory insulation. Don't forget the license plate and fuel door. Positioned 2 of these fore and aft of the optimul wheel location - haven't backed into the bikes or lowered the garage door on the bumper since! 
Does a super job on brass, copper, silver, aluminum, bronze and stainless steel. Polishes most metals to a mirror-like finish. Very similar to Flitz polishing cream. The Quik Interior Detailer is a great product from Meguiars. This provides the finish I like on my interior (not too glossy, but a nice clean matte finish).This interior detailer spray also has a nice smell to it. Safe for all surfaces (vinyl, leather, plastic, chrome, navigation/entertainment consoles and LCD screens). This does not only protect, but cleans stains, road film etc. off the paint and bring its to nice clean shine. My cars have ranged from light colours (white and silver) to darker colours (red and blue) and this works perfectly to clean and protect. Sometimes, depending on how dirty the paint was,  2 applications would be done to restore the finish. Safe on clear coats and glass this is perfect. Also, one heavy shower does not remove the wax. Give it a try. 
Primarily:  They do what they are supposed to for my 30 ft. trailer. Work well and easy.Secondarily: They came shipped in their own box, which is weak enough to need an outer box - arrived in pieces, but all metal held up, though scratched.  Needed to be a little less green to package the weight of 4 metal stands. My unit did not come with any instructions.  The tool seems too complicated to be very useful, but does work. Bottle came as described, have not had to use it, but it comes with the TPMS safe sealant in most flat kits. 
The Tender Jr. does not come with a cigarette adapter so I cut this in half to make two.

Nice item for the price and it&#8217;s made in Mexico. please note these are not white - but beige... other than that they are standard rv baggage catches these are a great additional tool for leveling the front and sides of the camper when you are by ourself! They are large enough to see from a distance to keep things on the level 
Great wheel lock that is easy to activate and unlock.  It comes with 3 keys, one of which has a LED light on it.  The product also comes with a reminder cord that attaches to the handle bar as a reminder.  It does just what I was looking for. The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around! This air deflector makes the air go to the side.  That's all it does.1. There are 2 pieces and no printed instructions - just the box where you can see how to assemble.2.  The 2 pieces fit together by grooves.  Slide and you can adjust by pulling/pushing to get it to fit on vent.3.  Magnets to hold this on vent.  The magnets aren't strong but - barely strong enough to hold on the ceiling.There's nothing good to look at with this deflector.  It kind of disappears since it's transparent plastic.If this will fit your vent, just get one.  See how you like it and you can order more later. 
This idea is the same as the house screen door closers we used many years ago.  A spring that attaches to both the door and the wall.  Thanks for having this, we needed to be able to keep the screen door closed because of our pets and this works great. I use JB Weld for everything and it rarely if ever disappoints.I had a problem with people stealing the mirrors off one of my motorcycles, so I JB Welded them to the bars.  Fixed!I had a lamp harp with a broken threaded fitting, so I JB Welded it back on and it works perfectly!I had door stoppers that kept falling off, so I JB Welded them and they're solid now!I've used JB Weld for at least 100 other fixes and I love the stuff. They stick on with double side tape.  I now have a little issue with the door not closing as easy, but I keep my doors off most the time so this works 
How do you rate these?  They do exactly what they are supposed to do.  What more can I say.  It don't stink no more?!  LOL GLAD  I  WENT  WITH  THE  CHROME AND  NOT  THE BLACK ONE, I  HOOKED  THIS ONE UP TO  MY GV1400 MOTORCYCLE IF  YOU  HAVE JUST  A  LITTLE  KNOW  HOW YOU CAN  DO  IT YOUR SELF , ALL  YOU WILL NEED TO GO WITH THIS IS A RELAY THAT DOES NOT COME WITH IT. YOU  CAN  GET IT ON HERE OR ANY PART STORE, I  HAVE MADE MANY PEOPLE JUMP  DUE  TO THE SOUND OF  THE  HORNS  LOUDNESS. I probably should compare it to another to see how accurate it is, but I really like how easy it is to use and turns off and on by itself. 
Fits on my Hi-Lift jack just fine. Does exactly what it is supposed to do.If you are using it on wheels that are deep make sure the straps are long enough to reach the spoke pattern. The Tender Jr. does not come with a cigarette adapter so I cut this in half to make two. I purchased 2 lighter plugs for a buck each from China&#8230; with free shipping&#8230; and they are working fine. These aren&#8217;t an exact match with the Tender cables but they fit together OK and are easy to determine polarity with the wire colors.

Nice item for the price and it&#8217;s made in Mexico. Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. 
These things are rated 8,000lbs but that's for ( GVW ) so while it's correct technically in reality each item is rated by the label at 2,000lbs per each item and if you had 4 (they sell them in pairs), if you had 4 of them you could put 8,000lbs on them, technically and according to them.****I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO RELY ON USER REVIEWS TO GET THE INDIVIDUAL WEIGHT RATING!!!!***GVW is a very deceptive and dangerous way to market and label these products.  Consider this, on a truck, the majority of the weight is on the front two wheels while the rear wheels don't have as much weight - same is true on a front wheel vehicle.  This leads to situations where you could overextend the capacity of these products.I'd like a very clear rating: 2,000lbs, 4,000lbs, 6,000lbs for each stand or ramp on Amazon so that I know how much weight I can safely put on it similar to what is found on jacks....a jack is not labeled as 6,000lbs if it can lift a 6,000GVW vehicle, 6,000lbs means that the jack can lift 6,000lbs!After all, I'm planning to get under these things!!!!On items like this where someone's life very literally depends on the labeling ---  it would be really really really nice (and a legal requirement) that the specifications on Amazon very clearly stated both the operating weight, maximium weight, and crush (failure) weight per each ramp/stand versus this GVW rating which is deceptive and just plain dangerous.I have very literally found people working underneath 8,000lbs trucks without the wheels using jack stands sold as "2ton" when in reality each jack stand was only rated at 1ton or 2,000lbs.....their comment back, "this is a 2 ton stand and 8,000lbs GVW divided by 4 is 2,000lbs or 1ton, plenty of margin."  When in reality 6,000lbs are up front....3,000lb for each wheel  and each stand rated at only 2,000lbs....making their jack stand 150% overloaded! --- horrendously scary (all because marketing is so bad in this area).  Yes people should exercise care in using double protection and users should Always read their instructions and warning before putting their life on the line -- but for the love of God, there is a responsibility on the makers and marketers of these products to label them very clearly and in bold with the weight that EACH can hold and Amazon should post that weight for each item in BOLD Yellow or Orange wording with very clear warnings.Amazon and automotive sellers on Amazon need to get on the ball regarding the needs of auto ethusiasts and for the safety of the weekend mechanic who should not have to do complex math to figure out how much weight each item can hold!We REALLY need to get away from GVW, it's deceptive and dangerous!****I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO RELY ON USER REVIEWS TO GET THE INDIVIDUAL WEIGHT RATING!!!!*** Didn't realize that this had a 3500LB capacity and 350 FT LBS for the tongue weight.  I'm using this on my travel trailer so I can take all our bicycles which all three bikes and bike rack make up a tongue weight of 180lbs.  A great buy It is apparently well made.  Works as you would expect.  Mine reads between 1 and 2lbs higher than the pressure compared with my racing gauge in the 29lb - 44lb range.  It is marked in 2lb increments but seems to bounce around a bit.  wouldn't count on getting closer than within 2 of your desired pressure with this unit.  It is good for filling past your point, knowing you are there,  then use a more accurate gauge and let air down to the exact pressure you seek.  For lots of uses it will be fine just to go with this tool and accept the +/- 2 lbs or so of error. 
These jack stands are pretty well made.  And very light.  They do the job and offer adequate height adjustment.  Only criticism is that the base is fairly small for its size and could get a little wobbly if the jack is extended to its maximum height.  I haven't had a problem yet, so this concern may be unwarranted.  I use these stands with hockey pucks for protection of my car's frame.  They fit nicely on top of the supports.  I would buy these again for sure. Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. I have a 98 Jeep Cherokee with the high back seats. These covers fit perfectly. The top-to-bottom fit is ever so slightly loose but I don't mind. The side-to-side fit is nice and tight. Quality of the material is good for the part you sit on, so-so for the back but who cares. Where else can you get 2 good covers for the price of 1? 
Save your paint buy the door gards for your jeep the only thing I can say is make sure you clean the door jam first and make sure you have lined up and its easy if read the instruction don't just peel the cover off and try and stick it on you will miss place the guards where you want them then pull on the clear tape and the cove will come off then just push down This is the OEM cabin air filter for the 2006 Acura TL, and trust me: this thing does what it's supposed to do. I couldn't believe how much crud this thing had caught between the B12 service on my girlfriend's 2006 TL.One thing I will say is that this is a PITA to replace. After disconnecting the glove compartment door and removing the two screws and push fittings securing the assembly to the console, pull the console down. Directly down. That means sit in the passenger seat and apply equal force to both sides of the assembly... or you'll break a tab and your interior will never be the same. I've seen two people make the mistake of busting the tabs loose right to left. Don't be another. These work great.Only need a small flat tip screw driver to pull back on the clips to remove the old ones and install the new ones.  Don't remove the clips completely, just pull them back a little bit and lift the hood gently at the same time.  2 people makes this a flash. 
This is a good starter kit for setting up a basic inverter system.  All three cables appear to be made well. The best thing about this product is the price.  You would be hard pressed making these cables yourself for the price. As many others have stated, these should be factory installed, but for the price and ease of installation, you can't beat the value. I didnt need all the pieces but this kit had what i needed.  I may use the other pieces at a later time, so this kit for the price was a great investment.  Very hight quality. 
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. It a belt... it fits, it hold and it rotates. There is no noise coming from it.Happy with the fit and performance. Great Fit 
I just got the Ramps this week and used them for the first time TODAY on my 2003 Chevy Silverado Extended Cab with a 5.3.  It actually has a 2/4 Drop and 20" Wheels with 275/45R20 Tires.  I was on my Asphalt Driveway,  I put the Ramps right it front of my front tires, Get into my truck, and drove right up them!!! Didn't slip AT ALL.  There is a Rubber Pad in the middle Front, pretty thick, not large,  but it seemed to work for me.  I used to be a Professional Mechanic 3 months ago, and always had access to Racks.  I Changed Occupations for the better, and so I no longer have Rack access.  So I got a set of these.Again my truck is lowered, and so I was worried about a ramp not fitting under the front of my truck to drive up.  I had no problem with these like I said.  I put them right up Against the tire, and then drove right on up!!!  The Negative is it's not UP very high, at least on my lowered truck.  On my Low to the ground creeper, I could just get under to change the oil and oil filter.  I wanted to change the Fuel filter also, but that was ALMOST impossible.  It's along the frame railing back a bit near the front of the Gas tank,  I could barley get back enough to just reach the filter and 2 wrench it with one hand to get the filter off.  I did manage though.  I wish I could of do it on a rack at my old Job, but my old Boss is P.Oed that I left.  Now he has to work far more and hired a couple Idiots to take my place.  I wouldn't get my car worked on there now!!!I'm not going to knock it down any stars because it didn't lift my truck up enough as I knew how much it would raise it before I ordered them.  Again, No slipping for my truck and it's Rear Wheel Drive!!!  It didn't Sink in the Asphalt, or Crack, or anything else.  Nice and Solid.  The Price was right as $48, with no tax and free 2nd day shipping for me.  It's harder for me to do oil changes these days, having to do it at home, but then again, I've seen some of the work so called Pro Mechanics do on peoples cars/trucks from different places, and I think I'll stick doing most ALL that I can, other then things that just isn't feasible for me to do at home.  Things like Smog Check. Sure you can use a C clamp or a adjustable wrench but this isn't very expensive and looks to be of reasonable construction. My only issue is I have everything to install brakes but I've been waiting for almost 3 weeks for a floor jack to ship and I'll be damned if I'm breaking out the jack out of my trunk when quality floor jack is on order. Ok finally used this tool and all I can say is Perfect! Works just as it should, I tightened in small slow increments and let the piston settle all the way back. Made adding the pads a dream, now if there was a way to keep the freak'n pads in place till you slide the caliper back in place ! lol We bought and installed extras of these on our RV, just because the manufacturer never seems to put them in convenient places.  I want to pull into my site, and sit right in my seat at the leveling controls and do everything right there.  I installed extra level bubbles around the driver so all my rough leveling is done, and THEN I can walk around and fine-tune it at the back.My only warning to buyers:  make SURE you have them exactly where you want them before pressing on.  They DON'T move or come back off.  It's actually difficult to set them prefect on the first try because they stick so well.  Use a good carpenter's level to get the RV straight, then hold these steady with both hands and place CAREFULLY.  I'm kinda shaky so I really had to brace my hands on the RV while setting them. 
Super heavy chain. Adjust chain so the tripod is about 6 inches lower that leveled trailer. Raise tripod using wrench included. Do not supoport full weight of trailer. This is for stabilization of the 5th wheel. In our case in provided extra stabilization for the bedroom. The install is easy, just level your camper using a carpenter level of 3 feet or longer.  Set the level from side-to-side on your smooth flooring or counter top. Then set the level from front-to-back the same way on the smooth flooring or counter top.  Now position the Hopkins 08525 levels, one on the side you prefer to work from at the front of the camper, on a flat vertical surface.  Do the same on a side wall near the front corner on a smooth vertical surface.  Use the double stick tape to position, but consider adding pop rivets or small screws to hold the setting for many years.  Holes are provided in the Hopkins levels.Use the front level first to drive onto leveling ramps or boards, then use the side level along with the tongue jack to finish (after you unhitch). Extend your stabilizer jacks and you're set for level comfortable sleeping in your camper. Everything about these jack stands speaks to quality.  These jacks stands are very well made of heavy gauge aluminum with a hardened steel pin with a bearing lock for the height adjustment.  Some light assembly with a flat head screw driver is required before use.  There's a screw (provided) that threads into the bottom of the base to fasten the stand support (red) and base together.  Another reviewer stated that his stand 'wobbled'. While it's possible that reviewers stand was defective, if the screw is threaded into the hole and tightened down firmly into the base, the stand won't wobble. On my SUV vehicle, the jack points are very close together, so the base of a tripod-style jack stand is too wide for use.  The narrow profile of these stands is perfect and allows me to slip the jack stand behind the jack and under the rear jack point. Once in position, remove the pin, adjust the height and reinsert the pin. I also don't care for the ratchet style jack stands, which have been known to fail.  There are lots of low priced jack stands on the market, but when it comes to safety (yours), spend a few extra dollars are get a pair of these pin-thru aluminum jack stands by Torin.  They work extremely well and they look cool too. 
I wanted a higher rating for my garage jack stands since they will be holding the Beast up while I scurry about underneath.  These fit the billl.  The safety bar gives me a little extra confidence and the welds look OK to my untrained eye. These jack stands do what they are supposed to do. My Disco 2 is about 5,000 lbs and they hold it just fine. My only advice is that you make sure you know your vehicle height. These jack stands are tall. I use them on the lowest setting on my Disco and I still have to jack it up an inch or so to get it high enough to put these under. I will be lifting it soon though, so that will change, and hence the reason I got these. For a normal car though, these would probably not be my first choice.Also, if you are using them on asphalt, be aware that they might sink down into the ground a little. On concrete you wouldn't have this problem, but asphalt is soft enough that the edges of the stands might cut through.Finally, be safe and get a good pair of wheel chalks to use. A very simple concept but someone had to be the first to invent it. I suspect others will soon imitate this.Photos show lifting tires. No doubt it would work fine for that - especially with heavy, over size tires (as shown) or farm equipment tires. But it's good for so much more.A piece of steel under the corner of a small building, set hooks under the steel, and lift the building for re-leveling. Hook it under a mower deck of a riding mower to remove/sharpen blades.You trust your jack, now trust the accessories they provide so you can get the most from it. Be sure to get the base for the jack, better than carrying around a piece of 2x6 and no one will toss it on your camp fire, either. 
I've been climbing around under cars since 1959 and these jack stands are sweet.  One can drop a four wheel drive on these puppies and they're not going flex.  Or one can get their sports car up to a "DECENT" working height of a shade under twenty-four inches.It doesn't matter if these have a capacity of six tons each or they're six tons for two of them because they're shipped and you're going use them......as a pair.  Our full size F-250, with tool boxes is 8,800 pounds so what do I care if they're not six tons each?  They're going be holding up a single corner or side of the vehicle at a time.  In the meantime, the spec sheet packaged inside the box the jack stands are packed in, clearly spec these jacks at 6T "each."If you need to be reassured, call the manufacture's customer service line between 8-5 PST @ 1-888-448-6746 and let customer service tell you directly what the truth is regarding any of your questions.On our jack stand copy, I checked the delivered jack stand base welds and found all gusset welds and manufacturing quality control, to be good to excellent manufacturing/welding.  I checked out the stamped sheet metal parts and found the stamped sheet metal work to be "excellent."  There was nothing in the manufacturing of our jack stands that would seem abnormal (a standout), cheap or inappropriate for a product of this kind.This is not a high end, tech grade, stainless steel, high pressure fitting where each weld is x-ray'd.  This is a typical red and black jack stand one uses at home or a shop to support a car, pickup, flatbed or box truck for the purpose of safely making repairs under a jacked up vehicle.  Used normally, with safety in mind during proper placement, there's no reason to believe that if you use these jack stands, you won't be able to safely get under a vehicle, make your repairs and get on to the next item on your check list.Overall, I am very pleased with the pair of auto jacks we received and I feel comfortable recommending these beasts to all who find themselves to be mechanically inclined and in need of safely crawling around under their jacked up vehicle. I grew up in the 80's so I remember well playing with Legos.  Building everying from cars to forts.  Well the Tri Lynx Comapny has brought us back our nostalic youth with Tri Lynx Levelers.  These are large square plastic pads (roughly 9"x9"x1" thick) that are stackable to just about any confgiuration you can imagine.  You can stack them in a "column" fasion for leveling jacks.  Or you can stack them in an offset alternating "brick wall" fasion for an interlocking leveler that is safe to drive on without fear of displacement.  They can even be stacked side by side for larger duel wheel RVs.  For my use, I wanted to use them for my leveling jacks and for pads were there was a side leaning tilt.  The box says to never stack more than 4 levelers high for a single configuration.  I've gone to 10 under my jacks and they still feel rock solid once pressure is put on them.I'm on my 4th set of Lynx levelers.  I'm convinced you can't have too many.  With that I fianlly invested in these "Stop'n Chocks"  Wonderful!!!  As I said these can be used under your wheels as well.  So the Stop n' Chalk stacks as the last piece at the rear of the Lynx configuration to allow the driver  just back up against them.  Now these are the most versitle set of leveling / chalking pads you can buy becasue they allow for front to rear leveling and side to side leveling.  If one side of the coach is lower than the other, you can build up just that side and use standard chalks on the other.  Also if you have enough of the Tri Lynx levelers you could potentially place say 2" of lift under a front axel on an tandem configuration and 4 or even 5" under a rear.  The one draw back is that you would need enough to building this as one continous pad (say 8' long or so.)  But like legos, if you have enough, your imagination is the limit.A couple of notes:  You MUST use these in conjunction with TriLynx levelers.  They will not work on their own.  In addition there is a noctch carved out of the front to force the user to stack in the above mentioned "brick wall" alternating fasion so that there's no risk of sepertaion between the levels as the rig is driving on or off the pad.  Also, I stongly suggest a spotter!  Driving a rig on or off a 9" wide "rail" is dangerous and having someone to tell you that you a little too close to the edge is a must. These jack stands are awesome....very tall.  My jeep has 4-5 inch of lift and is sitting on 35s.  These stands have no problems holding it off the ground with lots of room to spare! 
I hate how they force a comment! There really isn't much to say except the item was as discribed and it arrived on time and functions as it should. Just be sure your RV is level with a 4 foot level on the floor both ways before sticking them on. There are plenty of RV Park type campgrounds out there.  However I like the scenic view and smells of a wooded campground.  There's just one problem with these.  In my area of the country, these are usually built on a ridge and the pads aren't always as level as they could be.  For owners of most larger rigs, you know well that the stablizer jacks have NO ability to level a trailer that isn't level.  Enter the Camco Tri-Levelers.  Back your trailer into within 18" of your intended final stopping point on the pad.  Lay a pair of these right behind the rear tires of the trailer, making sure their parallel with the tires.  Back up until you've achived your desired height.  On asphalt these will not move.  Then use a pair of standard chalks to chalk the front tires.  After that, your set, drop your trailer and set it up.Why do you need them?  Of course, camp long enough and you'll see everything from people driving their trailers onto 2x8s to slabs of concrete.  These are MUCH safer, will not rot, will not slide, and will not crack.  They are study and made of think ridged plastic.  Each one I would say weighs about 5 lbs so they'll still be lighter than anything else you carry.  And they will last forever!  You could safely leave these under your rig for years without worrying about damage from weather or sunlight.Why not 5 stars?  Three reasons...  1) It's not safe to use these on your own without a spotter.  An experienced RVer can back his rig onto a pad with no assistance.  However with these it's just not safe.  You could easily back off the back edge since the rear lip is no taller than the ones to each tier of leveling.  2) These are only suitable you rearward sloping pads with minimal side-to-side slope.  Due to the face that these are only 18" long they cannot level a tandem axel trailer from side to side as both axels will not touch the leveler.  And they are too long to fit a second Tri-leveler under the front tire for standard trailers.  Though side-to side leveling would be possible for single axel trailers.  3) Final placement is important as it could damage your tires (especially if being left for a season.)  When I use them and the trialer is still hiched it pinches the tire.  After leveling this seems to go away.  But if it didn't and you were concerned for your tires, this would mean rehitching and adjusting.  Each level is only about 5" long by approximately 9" wide.  So tire contact can be an issue.  For more agressive slopes, my recommendation after using them a couple of times.  Drive you rig onto them until the rear of the chock (whichever level your using) is pinching your tire.  And making sure you don't drive off the back!  Then when you let the tongue down it will stop pinching and sould be just right.Final thoughts...  These levelers are purpose built for the most common type of leveling.  They do very well at that.  They don't do well with other types of leveling.  Though I suppose you could use them with a foward slope as well if you were creative with your tongue jack.  If it seems like I'm being critical of them, I'm just trying to give an honest review.  I do think they are a great, well built product that is worth owning if you enocounter this type of issue with your trailer.  If you have issues with side-to-side leveling, there are other products out there that will suit you better as well as cost you more.  Personally I own both since I never know what type of situation to expect.  I like the simple design.  No assemlby means they're easy to move.  Unless the situation requires it I will always grab these first for just that reason.  One final thing to consider.  Anytime you raise a tire or pair of tires on your trailer you're obviously going to have a more significant rise on the end of your trailer.  Make sure your carrying something to let you sill use your stablizing jacks. As high beams are on only when its really dark I liked the increased field of vision how it increased the sides and the length of what I can see.  Yes I would buy them again. 
Considering this is made in China, it is a quality product, too bad all my locks are keyed to the some number I've read rave reviews on this stuff for years, finally ordered some and the reviews are right. great product.Pros- no/low shine. no greasy feel. nice smell, after a while.Cons- strong smell at first but it dissipates quickly. I guess I'm a bit jaded .. I'm always surprised when something actually does what it's supposed to.. It works well if you have half a brain unlike some other reviews that I have read of people that can't get it to work.. Either they are a little gumpy or the laws of physics cease to exist in the particular location they happen to be in... 
The pair of levels are a great value.  I recently purchased these for a second time, as the originals were sold with my previous trailer and I wanted to make my new trailer easier to get on a level stance.There really isn't much to go wrong as far as product failure is concerned.  Accuracy is up to you with the initial installation.Recommended method of installation is to get your trailer level/RV, front to back, and side to side.  Once you have your trailer true, install the graduated levels in locations which will show you front to back level (placed on the side of the trailer) and side to side (place on the front or back of the trailer).  Make sure the bubble indicates "level" by being in the center point of the tube.Installation should be done once all your components are "stressed" as they will be for trailer/RV use (I.E. front tongue on a travel trailer, all the normal weight sitting on the winch foot, or in the case of 5th wheels/motorcoaches, landing gear down), try to place the levels on the RV in clear view of the winch/landing gear controls to enable leveling without having to relocate to a different location to view the levels.I accomplished this on a travel trailer by placing one level on the very front center, and the other on the side of the frame tongue close to the winch.  Though small, with sharp eye-sight, you can take advantage of the one on the front of the trailer as you position the trailer to see if you can establish a level side to side stance as you near your desired location.On my 5th wheel, my landing gear controls are on the front corner of the main body.  I placed one on the side of the rig for front to back level, and another right around the corner on the front side (for side to side level) still within sight of the controls, as well as from the truck cab for backing up.  Even though the level is off center, if it is installed properly with the trailer level at the time of installation, it will work fine.As far as the graduated scales are concerned, you will have to find your "scale" for adjustments, as it depends on where the levels are placed in reference to the center of the pivot points.The levels come with a self adhesive foam strip on the back for placement as well as two holes for screws if you wish to drill holes in the side of your rig.  I go with the adhesive strip route, as I don't like unnecessary holes.  The only negative with the adhesive strips is they will flex if stressed and it can put the levels off level, though this only happened to me with the first pair after the foam tape aged a few years.One last comment . . .the green bubble tube will fade from extended UV exposure.  It will not interfere with the accuracy, just makes it a little harder to read.If you are looking for larger levels which can be read from a distance, I know they are out there, but I have no experience with them to make a comparison.  I do not wish to clutter the appearance of the rig with large levels. Excellent replacement for the original wipers on our Mazda5.  I typically prefer to go up a size on wipers since it gives a larger clean area.  You can typically go up 2 inches which translates to one inch per side from where the blade attached to the arm.  When the car is dirty, you should be able to see where that extra inch goes - if it hits the top of the trim or other part, you're out of luckWe're using a 28" blade on the drivers side of my wife's Mazda5, and this clears very nicely - no skips or squeaking.  Although it is now spring, this type of blade has an advantage over the multi-piece blade designs in that ice can't get trapped in the arm, so winter driving is much easier. Easy to replace. It lacks Toyota instructions, but it is exactly like existing Toyota part with all wires colored the same way so it is very obvious how to connect those.The original part has a silicone rubber tube going all the way from top to bottom with wires running inside it. This part only provides a short length of tubing that, at best, would cover half of the length of wires on my car.I thing they should provide a &#34;telescoping&#34; tubing of two diameters with one going inside of the other while you are crimping wires and then extended to cover the full length of wires 
If you leave spark plugs in an aluminum head for 100,000 miles, your spark plugs may break or the threads strip when you try to remove them.  Using anti-seize is supposed to prevent this.  If you use it, torque to the lower end of the tolerance because of the added lubrication from the anti-seize.  I never had spark plugs stuck even without anti-seize so I can't say for certain that it works but it is cheap insurance.  You can use it on any fasteners subject to corrosion. The only thing I have against scissor jacks is that after they have been raised to the height prior to having to level my 31' RV, it requires quite a hefty force to raise it for leveling. The included socket and turn handle had the pin break at the socket and I had to improvise with an icepick for a temporary repair. A Camco socket that I purchased also for using fit perfect, but a 3/8" drill wanted to burn out tring to raise the jacks. I plan to use something more powerful next time. I'd like to see some gearing on the crank to make the jack raise easier when leveling my rv. THe Jack does have the strength and ability to take the weight without any problem. I use this for my hi-lift, just as nature intended. As advertised, it keeps the jack handle isolated and free from noise while driving. Keep in mind, when it comes time to use the jack, you will need to unbolt the chain mount typically placed on top of the jack to remove the handle isolator completely, which is a bit of a nuisance. Still though, this is an essential part for anyone with a Hi Lift jack. 
First, as with all of the Dupli-Color Metalcast paints, if you want the metalcast effect, you'll have to use the Dupli-Color Metalcast Ground Coat (MC100) on the surface before you apply the color or it will not come out right. The can says that it also comes out the same if you're painting directly onto chrome like surface but I have not tried this so I don't know. Now for this green. I'm more of a blue and purple guy for dark colors so only by my personal preference do I say that this green comes out just a tad light in color for me. Overall though, if you use the ground coat this comes out great with a nice metal sheen. I recommend this product. I have always had good results with Dupli-Color products and this engine paint is no exception. It goes on easy and covers in just a few passes. Dries fast and has good flow out. Plus these colors beat the dull steak habit, they are a welcome break for the usual Ford blue and Chevy orange. They are durable and and have pretty good heat resistance. I really like how this color turned out. Hella Replacement.  Kinda.  Mine came with BLUE wire.. they should always be white. Its also not covered in fabric and the white ones are. 
Well made Excellent quality.  American made.  Top notch all the way around.  Built to last. Great quality.  American made. 
I bought two sets / 4 total. I use them near the middle of the lifting range which puts the saddle about 18 to 19 inches high. This is perfect to get my truck off the ground and give me an inch or so of ground clearance to R&R; the tires and do other work underneath the vehicle.I don't need 6t worth of lift, but I like how these j/s have a wide lifting range. With these set for my range (as stated above), they are not teetering at the top of the range like others I've used in the past, but are comfortably in the middle. They are very stable and solid units.It would be helpful if the info stated the lifting range of the units, not just the tonnage they can support as a pair.Min. Lift Height (in.)14 29/32Max. Lift Height (in.)23 1/2 This seems to be one of the better levelers. There are two different scales on these levels. One is for the side-to-side (back of the coach) and the other is for the front-to-back (side of the coach). The reason there are different scales are they are more-or-less calibrated in inches.For example, it is simple Trigonometry to determine how many inches the coach is out of level simply by using the formula for right-angles and solve for one side. The input values are the angle (determined by the level) and distance from the level to the point at where you want to know how many inches of lift are needed.For the side-to-side level, the 1&#34; markings are pretty accurate as long as you put the scale in the center of the coach, as most coaches are within an inch or two of width from another.  However, for the front-to-back level, even though you put the scale in the center, the result will vary wildly due to the length of the coach. Using this level on a 18ft coach will result in a far different measurement than say a 35ft coach.Also, if you don't put the level in the center (in the side or back), then the two ends of the coach will be different. For example, if the level is in the center, then when the level measures 1&#34; off level, that means 1&#34; on either front or back. But if you put the level off-center, then the level reading 1&#34; might truly be 1/2&#34; on one end, and 1 1/2&#34; on the other. Again, it is simply a principle of Right Angles in Trigonometry.Also, do not rely on the self-adhesive backing as over time it can move. As hard as it may be for you to do, drilling a couple holes and inserting screws into the levels is the best bet. The install is easy, just level your camper using a carpenter level of 3 feet or longer.  Set the level from side-to-side on your smooth flooring or counter top. Then set the level from front-to-back the same way on the smooth flooring or counter top.  Now position the Hopkins 08525 levels, one on the side you prefer to work from at the front of the camper, on a flat vertical surface.  Do the same on a side wall near the front corner on a smooth vertical surface.  Use the double stick tape to position, but consider adding pop rivets or small screws to hold the setting for many years.  Holes are provided in the Hopkins levels.Use the front level first to drive onto leveling ramps or boards, then use the side level along with the tongue jack to finish (after you unhitch). Extend your stabilizer jacks and you're set for level comfortable sleeping in your camper. 
Super heavy chain. Adjust chain so the tripod is about 6 inches lower that leveled trailer. Raise tripod using wrench included. Do not supoport full weight of trailer. This is for stabilization of the 5th wheel. In our case in provided extra stabilization for the bedroom. I bought two sets / 4 total.

As good as originals at a good price. Much better quality than some of the knock-offs in the local stores. Iridium plugs are worth the few extra dollars.  They last longer and perform better!They have also been known to to eliminate low-end stumbles, deacceleration backfires, and similar issues.Current price at Amazon (with free shipping) is cheaper than my local motorcycle shop and also cheaper than Bike Bandit. This is an K and N recharge kit with the Aerosol not the pour out style that works easier for the user. Great buy for less than what you would pay any where else for the same stuff. Well worth the price and shipping and receiving were simple and super fast. Thanks again Amazon. 
Good quality R.V. water heater drain valve. Brass construction with a steel finger tip handle built in. A vital component when winterizing or just performing general maintenance. Teflon tape will seal threads upon install. Great replacement for older leaking or rusty valves. It is a shutoff, does what it is supposed to. Camco 40003 RV Water Tank Filler with Shutoff Valve.  would buy again a must on water pumps, thermostat housings, fuel pump mount to the engine block and on differential covers. also good for a thread sealant. highly satisfied.

Not sure why Harley can't put this nut on their filters, or maybe an inward 1/2" driver hole.  Anyway, it makes yanking this thing off much easier because the strap wrench or the Harley-style filter wrench doesn't let you get your hand in there to manage the filter and all the oil that pours out after it comes loose.  This helps me ensure a clean oil change... as clean as it can be.  Not sure why they chose 17mm for the bolt size, but whatever.  What I wasn't excited about was that, at least for me, the black paint seemed to not be "as black" as the Harley filter, or it may have faded or been affected negatively by road salt or something.  It wasn't gray or anything, it just wasn't as black as the Harley filter I replaced it with (because I couldn't wait for shipping from Amazon.com).  Not a big deal... it's still black.  Just not... as black. First off, don't get turned off by the name, Yellow is the color of the stuff, it won't turn your paint yellow!  It does look great on yellow paint though, also reds and darker colors like dark blue and black.  For lighter colors you are better off going with something else, Collinite 845 is a great choice.Pros:-DRIPPY wet looks.  You'll want to grab a towel and dry your paint, its that wet!-Decent durability, approx 2-3 months on a car parked outdoors-Fills in minor swirling-Leaves paint nice and slickCons:-Stains trim (rubber, black plastic)-Needs to be applied very thin, otherwise it can be hard to take off-Can streak if used on a hot surface or if too much is usedOverall, this is a great wax that has been around for a very long time because it looks so great.  its a total steal at the price. 
This is one the best oil filters on the market for the Harley-Davidson Motorcycles. I use these filters on my 2007 Harley-Davidson Fatboy Motorcycle because they do a great job in filtering my oil. The oil filter on my Harley is mounted on the front of the engine. This location plus the fact the crank position sensor is in the way of using most oil filter wrenches, you have to buy a special wrench, which will slip in use, to remove the oil filter . This oil filter has a 17mm nut welded on end of the filter housing, this makes installing or removing the oil filter very easy. You don't have to worry about damaging your Engine Crank Position Sensor which are expensive to replace. I highly recommend this great K&N Performance Oil Filter for any Harley-Davidson Motorcycle owner who uses regular or synthetic motor oil. Great price and it's chrome plated to boot. It filters oil and comes with the gasket and crush washer you need to change the oil I bought it on Amazon, verified buyer. It is true that sometimes it takes times for oil to lubricate your engine: it could be weak oil pump or restricted flow. It fits my Lexus LS400. After I change oil with this new filter, I hear the ticking sound on the engine head; it could be the filter restrict oil flow and cause the oil not to flow easily. 
It fits perfect on my riding mower 18.5 hp B&S engine.Phram is a excellent quality replacement oil filter for my mower engine The tool appears to be of average quality.  However, I returned it to Amazon since it did not fit up to a Ford Taurus flex fuel engine.  This type of engine requires a special fitting that this tool does not have. Even though Amazon says it does not fit my truck; it does fit my 2002 Chevrolet 2500HD crew cab with 6.0L gas engine. I replaced both sensors and harness. Both sensors were rough looking and the rear sensor had standing water on it. It was a little bit of a chore to get to them because you have to remove the intake but it was not too bad. 
Love this product and I love the price.  I don't know how they have such a great product at this price but they do and I love it!  Will buy much more. They say if you buy the best you won't be sorry.  But just because it costs more doesn't mean it's the best, does it?  Well I think in this particular case it is the best.  And you will pay for it.The Chevron Techron product gets high scores from everyone & everything I have read in many automotive mags, but the equipment they make it with must be made from gold boullion.  Suffice it to say if you want to clean your engine parts that gas touches, this stuff is the best.  I just gave it 4 stars because of price not quality.  I own several cars, motorcycle, boat, waverunners, so I'd buy it by the case if the price would come down enough to make it worth while.  On the other hand if you have one or two cars, I guess you don't need to put it in the tank all that frequently to obtain the results you want.  A bottle of piece of mind?  Yes, it works. I dont really have much to say but there chrome and they work on all wheels. Oh my only Con is I got Ripped off!!! Don't let the Price you see Fool you. I payed 11 bucks for these. 
I installed this with a Whisper King pump and accumulator kit.  I'm not sure of how each of the components performs on their own, all I can confirm, is that when you install the Whisper King, the pump silencing kit and this accumulator, you'll achieve the performance you're looking for and the system is very quiet.  I'm guessing, but I'd say it's more than half as quiet with this set up. I installed this with a Whisper King pump and a pump silencing kit.

Excellent kit for a normal width receiver. It has all you need. It will not fit a Tacoma or Tundra as the pins are not long enough. For a regular width receiver it is a perfect set, I just wish they would make a kit like this for the larger receiver. The kit is complete and very nice but I can't dock it stars for not fitting an unusual receiver. One key for all is great and it comes in a nice storage bag. Needed a brake controller and this one came highly recommended.  Smaller than it looks, so fits the Jeep JK perfectly.  But, I could only give it three stars because Tekonsha does not make a plug-in adaptor for the Jeep JK, so this is a "wire by hand" deal that takes some time in the cramped quarters of the Jeep.  They make the plug ins for many other vehicles, don't understand their lack of coverage for the Jeep.  Build is high quality, and I like the manual control on the bottom, just in case you don't feel that the automatic braking is enough in certain situations. Does what it supposed to do,Fits most of my scooters.Does not fit a Honda Shadow 750's disc brake, because the disc is too wide.One star less, because the mechanism to mount the pouch to the handlebars is very weak, and impractical (I can't install it on handlebars of scooters because they have the handlebars covered with plastic, and can't install it on the handlebars of my motorcycle, because the hand grips and throttle are too wide, so it does not fit; the pouch also does not have a locking mechanism, so it's kind of moot to try to mount it somewhere).Otherwise, a great purchase! 
This sunshade is easy to use and folds up to a nice compact size that fits under my seat well. It's a quite large size so is made for an SUV or car that has a large windshield like my Toyota Prius. While it doesn't fit the Prius perfectly, it's the closest size to being perfect.At this price, I have no complaints with this and can recommend it. Didn't realize that this had a 3500LB capacity and 350 FT LBS for the tongue weight.  I'm using this on my travel trailer so I can take all our bicycles which all three bikes and bike rack make up a tongue weight of 180lbs.  A great buy I got them for my Camry and they are perfect fit for front or rear seat head rests.Convenient to carry shirts from laundry, hang umbrella, wife's purse and grocery bags. 
Sets under the left side frame rail under the drivers door. (2005 Ford F150) ... If you have the proper filter wrench it's a very fast job. I stuck this mirror onto the wall of my cubicle to keep an eye on spies wondering by. It stuck to the fabric lining and works very well. It is clear and the flip thing works fine.  It fit my stock mount on my windshield perfectly.  It does come with a mount for you to use, just no glue.  But, as I said, it fit my old one with no problems at all. 
ok, but very light weight Didn't realize that this had a 3500LB capacity and 350 FT LBS for the tongue weight.  I'm using this on my travel trailer so I can take all our bicycles which all three bikes and bike rack make up a tongue weight of 180lbs.  A great buy These seem well made and are as advertised.  Heavy yes but the construction seems worth the weight.  Look at the mfg weight rating.  While these seem strong enough for automotive work I would be leery for weight limits over recommendation.  I concur with all of the positive reviews. 
I like this design because it has nothing to hang down and it fits equally well inserted from either direction. The rubber cap keeps junk out of the lock's workings. It's strong enough to handle any load you will put on it from a class V hitch (tested to 40,000 lbs).It's good enough that this is my second of these locks. First is still great, needed one for another vehicle. We put these on the front and rear of our 4door JK.  We lifted it 4&#34; and put 35s on it so it was getting harder to get in and out, these handles are at the top rollcage bar and very strong. Cinch is easy to use.  Connected a 30,000 lb recovery rope to a 40,000 lb tree saver and pulled a stuck Dodge out of the mud.  Really strong and light weight. 
The Tender Jr. does not come with a cigarette adapter so I cut this in half to make two. I purchased 2 lighter plugs for a buck each from China&#8230; with free shipping&#8230; and they are working fine. These aren&#8217;t an exact match with the Tender cables but they fit together OK and are easy to determine polarity with the wire colors. You can also just use this as an extension cord for your Tender. The description states a length of 12-inches&#8230; but it&#8217;s actually 14-inches tip-to-tip on the connectors. Nice item for the price and it&#8217;s made in Mexico. I bought these to change the tires on my GSXR. These tire irons are bigger than they appear to be. The description has them listed as small tire irons but the ones I received are 18 inches long from tip to tip and about 11.67mm thick (see pic). The thickness and the fact that these irons have a handle means you can place maximum pressure on them and they won't bend. The end has an s tip that gets under the tire and makes it easy to lift the tire over the rim. These are well made and will last a long time. The Amazon description says it holds six quarts.  The stamped information on the bottom of mine says seven quarts.  From experience, I'd say it holds well over 6 but not quite 7 quarts.The cap seals nice and tight -- I have no worries about putting it in my trunk (full of oil) to tote it to Pep Boys for oil disposal.  (Although I wrap it in a trash bag just in case.)The funnel attaches well and stores away easily, even with oily hands.  There's a kind of a four-sided grate over the funnel hole that may stand a chance of catching a washer or drain bolt before it falls in.  The grate can also be used to tighten and twist off the funnel.It's made of thick, strong plastic that seems as if will last for a very long time.  It is extremely low to the ground, and fits easily both under my Honda and my riding mower.For those people who think the funnel is too small -- I don't share the concern.  If your car's drain bolt is more than a foot or so higher than the funnel, perhaps you need to sit the container on a cinder block or something to raise it.  Part of my oil change toolkit is a chain like the kind you find on pens at the bank (see attached link).  I use it like a plumb line to ensure that the funnel is well under the drain bolt.MMF Industries Secure-A-Pen Ballpoint Counter Pen with Base, Black Ink, Medium (28904) 
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. Inexpensive, yet works as good as the ones sold by Honda dealerships. Made true to specs and fits right into the slot on my Accord 2006.Will buy again. 
Did not fit my car's filter harness after Amazon's compatibility tool said it would, there was a 1.5&#34; gap compared to the OEM filter, I have a 2006 Honda Civic Si - steer clear of this if you own the same car I used this in my manual shift Nissan D21 Hardbody. These transmissions (Nissan, Honda, and Toyota) contain what are called Yellow Metals (brass synchronizers and bearings), so they can NOT take newer GL-5 or those parts can be worn away within 10k miles.When I replaced my older, non-synthetic oil with this newer synthetic oil, the transmission shifts better and smoother, goes into gears better, etc.I liked this stuff so much, I ordered it again for another vehicle. I recently bought a 2011 Hyundai Tucson loaded to the gills and was astonished at how impossibly wimpy the single note factory horn was.  Leather seats, nav, panoramic sunroof, bluetooth, backup camera, kick-*ss sound system with subwoofer and iPod integration, etc., all kinds of toys.  Yet the factory horn sounds almost as robust as the horn in the 1966 VW bus my family had when I was a kid.  "Meep meep."  Note I said the Hyundai horn was ALMOST as robust as the '66 VW.  I think the VW horn had a little more oomph.  What was Hyundai thinking??I found a Hyundai tech to swap the original Hyundai/Kia P.O.S. horn with this item and the results are awesome.  My first ever new-car mod and it worked out great. 
Mobil 1 V-Twin 20W-50I was skeptical about using this oil in my Ducati 696 at first, because the manual had specified 15W-50 and many other riders wanted me to use a 10W-40 instead. Many of them claimed that the 20W-50 was designed for slow revving Harley-Davidsons with true V-Twins instead of the somewhat higher revving L-Twins from Ducati.I had clutch slippage with Rotella T6 5W-40, so I tried the M1 V-Twin 20W-50 because it is the only over the counter synthetic xW-50 JASO MA-compliant oil I can find outside the realm of boutique Motorcycle-specific oils from Motul or Silkolene at nearly double the price.The V-Twin 20W-50 is fairly thick out of the bottle, and my 696's engine starts up with a slow lumbering attitude and sound. I contacted Mobil to make sure they would recommend it, and they stated that the V-Twin 20W-50 was the correct oil to use in my 696. Once on the road, I didn't hear/feel anything wrong. WOT 9000 RPM upshifts were clean and precise. The datalogs I got from my Ducati Data Acquisition did not show any RPM spikes, and I did not hear the cat-like screeches after an upshift.As for the high-revving engine comment earlier, I looked up Buell's 1125 and Aprilia's RSV4 engine oil requirements. They both called for 15W-50, and Amsoil's catalog showed recommendations for 20W-50. The 1125 and RSV4 are by no means low revving engines, they can rev higher than most of Ducati's engines which are already fairly high at 9k-11k RPM.Overall: 5/5 stars, great oil to use if your bike needs 15W-50. Bought this to use withValterra F02-4100 45 RV Hydroflushso I could wash out my tanks.Here is my review of that setuphttp://www.amazon.com/Valterra-F02-4100-45%C2%B0-RV-Hydroflush/product-reviews/B0002UHVAA/ref=cm_cr_dp_synop?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints;=0&sortBy;=bySubmissionDateDescending#R2CUAU2B8XC98QIt works great.I also like that I have this as an emergency backup if one of my valves ever fails. Red line diff  oil for my 02 C5 Z06!!!other than all diff oils smelling bad, great oil and will put my Z06 to the limit w/o worring about diff. 
2007 F=150 Ford Pickup (Triton V-8).  No tether without you rigging it but it does the job.  Depends on what you want.  I'm happy.Update 02/10/2014Has proven to function tho sometimes finicky on the relock and after use seems somewhat flimsy.  I probably will replace with a metal one somewhere along the line (if available) and am lowering my original rating from five to three stars accordingly. It's an aftermarket replacement idler pulley.  It fits and works but I give it the extra star since it is a metal pulley instead of plastic (oem). does its job, durable, CHEAP!!!its only 4 star review said they wished it snapped, or clicked, but its a tight, snug fit, u can tell its not going anywhere.all my lights work perfect, dont question it, buy it, u wont regret. 
Below is the formula:1/3: to the manifold (using brake booster)1/3: to the fuel tank1/3: to the engineYour engine will be much cleaner. Remember: do it at night, otherwise, you will scare your neighbor with dark smoke. Works perfectly on engine and transmission oil drain plugs on all cars and most valve gaskets on imports.  I use this stuff any where I can on the engine to prevent leaks happening. Forget the rest. The others are only gimmicks compared to Chevron Techron. Techron absolutely works. It will remove the corn fuel tarnish from your engine and keep those injection needles clean. Yes, I said tarnish. Tarnish will build up in your engine, fuel lines and injectors if you are not using Techron. No, it doesn't matter if you have a 'flex fuel' automobile or not, this tarnish is akin to pancake syrup and will eventually ruin your engine. 
IT WORKS Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.  The pickle fork is the last resort for me, as it will damage the balljoint boot.I prefer to use the Snap On balljoint remover.  If that one cannot fit, then I will try this tool.  If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork. Very sticky stuff that will stay where you want it.  It's also very slippery, so should work fine for any motor work you have. 
Be sure to check with the Auto or Truck Manufacturer to find the correct SIZE of Oil Filter for your vehicle. Amazon's Parts Locator says that the Motorcraft  FL820S does not fit my 1995 Mercury Grand Marquis, 4.6 Litre V-8 engine. This is incorrect. The fact is that the Motorcraft FL820S is the FORD-recommended filter for my 1995 Mercury engine, and is recommended in almost every application of the Ford /Mercury/Lincoln 4.6 Litre engine size.The Motorcraft FL820S interchanges with the BOSCH 3410, the FRAM TG2, and the K&N; 2010.The Motorcraft FL820S  has over 50 pleats, high flow rate, silicone anti-drainback valve, and steel end caps.Amazon's current low price ($3.69) is an excellent value for a quality oil filter that's MADE IN USA !!My car is driven in heavy traffic, desert temperatures, mountain driving, and trans-desert trips from Phoenix to L.A.The standard FORD Motorcraft Filters performed just as well as the high-dollar types -- and filtered MUCH better than the K&N;, which has a very high flow rate (for racing), but the low 90% efficiency rating of the K&N; makes it a no-no for extended oil changes. I wouldn't run a K&N; oil filter for more than 3,000 miles -- you'd just be stirring up dirty oil and pumping it through the bearings !! :>(For my American V-8 engine, I have found the best value to be the Motorcraft FL820S Oil Filter and Mobil 1 5-W-20 Extended Life (Synthetic) engine oil. The quality of the oil filter allows for filter changing every 5,000 miles, and the engine oil is changed once-a-year, regardless of miles driven.For maximum oil life, be sure your PCV system is working properly -- Remove and wash out the PCV Valve with Carburetor  Cleaner, and check for collapsed and/or damaged PCV hoses. A leaking PCV system will suck un-filtered dirt right into your engine !!1995 Mercury Grand Marquis RS225 HP 4.6 Litre SOHC V-8Modified Air Box w/ K&N; Air FilterBosch Impeller Fuel PumpBosch 19 Lb.

I haven't really used it yet for the reason intended, changing the oil in my jet ski.  So, I can't comment on how well it works.  The main reason for this review is to put it out there that it does not work with a 2000 Chevy Silverado.  The siphon tube does not fit thru the bottom of the dip stick tube.  It would be really nice if Mityvac had a published list of what vehicles it works with and what ones it does not.  I have my fingers crossed that it'll work with my jet ski, otherwise there will be a new/(un)used Mityvac on *****'slist.  Long story short, do your research to see if you can confirm or deny if it will work with your vehicle before you buy it. 
I purchased these to increase my light output on my motorcycle.  It is an improvement over the standard 55W low beam that was in there. I wanted upgrade the gear oil in my new Mustang GT and selected Royal Purple because of its reputation and durability. It is noteasy to distinguish between the 2 oils in the gears but I certainly noticed a difference using RP in my 6-speed transmission. Used this on my 2004 BMW 325Ci for my Transmission Fluid Change. Noticed an immediate difference on how the car shifts. I would recommend this product to all BMW owners 
This fits not only the Ecotec, but newer VW TDI's with the canister filter.  Works great, relatively low profile and goes nicely on a 3/8&#34; drive.  I accidentally ordered three (fat fingered the cart), and sold one to a fellow VW driver and one to a guy with a GM. Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars This fit all four O2 sensors on my 2002 Toyota Tundra and I could have not completed the job without this specialized socket. 
Works great, nice to have a second cable, but the OBD end of the cable is angled.  In my case, this cable won't work on my Subaru Outback.  I would prefer the option of a straight OBD connector.  Note that the angle connector works on my other four cars (Mazda, Honda, Dodge). I cut the horn off the compressor. The horn will fit under the stock cowbell. The compressor was attached under the right side panel to the frame with 3 large zip ties. I ran some hose from home depot to the cowbell and connected it to the stock horn wire. The horn sound goes right between the cylinders and is loud as h3ll.  Many of cell phone scum bags will tell you that my set up works real good.

OEM quality, as mentioned, made in Japan.  The only gripe is the OEM cap has Honda screws that are have washer locks on them to keep them on the cap and thus less likely to drop while removing them.  The replacement screws are separate.  The cap also comes with a replacement gasket.TIP:  Always replace plug wires one at a time from the old cap to the new cap in the same order/rotation you pull from.May as well replace the rotor and coil while you are at it:Beck Arnley  173-7988  Ignition RotorOEM 5100A Ignition Coil This O2 sensor was a direct replacement for the original part.  Wire was the correct length and wires/plug matched original perfectly.  Easy install and I have seen a few MPG increase in fuel economy since installation.  The replacement of these sensors will also help ensure longer catalytic converter life.  Very happy with this purchase. Exact replacement for my transmission on my F-150 2001 transmission.  Use the original gasket as stated by manufacturer and drop pan and remove and insert new filter&#8230;add fluid and you're good to go 
A good buy.  Does the same job that the Honda OEM part does. Does what it says it does......looks great ! Does what it is designed to do and Amazon has great prices on them. But, if you are replacing yours on a ford f-250 with 5.4 go with 15718 with the longer cord. And a 2003 f250 w/5.4L only has 2 not 4 like it shows. 
This product will do what is says it will do.  That being said, it does not inspire confidence in heavy use situations.  It does not appear very rugged.  Nice that it comes with the mount, but again the mount is very thin and light and probably won't last very long.  Also, the wire coloring does not match with the standard US codes.  White is ground on the item, while in most cases in the US, black is the ground wire.  Where was this thing made?  Again, it is a good price, and a useful product, but just beware it might be very rugged or reliable.  Make sure to read the enclosed documentation so that you match your wiring correctly. GLAD  I  WENT  WITH  THE  CHROME AND  NOT  THE BLACK ONE, I  HOOKED  THIS ONE UP TO  MY GV1400 MOTORCYCLE IF  YOU  HAVE JUST  A  LITTLE  KNOW  HOW YOU CAN  DO  IT YOUR SELF , ALL  YOU WILL NEED TO GO WITH THIS IS A RELAY THAT DOES NOT COME WITH IT. YOU  CAN  GET IT ON HERE OR ANY PART STORE, I  HAVE MADE MANY PEOPLE JUMP  DUE  TO THE SOUND OF  THE  HORNS  LOUDNESS. This is a great product.  You can see exactly what goes thru it and will know when the tanks are clean. 
I use this in my 2005 Lincoln Town Car Signature Limited.Always use Motorcraft in a Ford/Lincoln/Mercury vehicle.This will last a long time, but you don't necessarily need toreplace it every year.  Fuel filters are best replaced after a certainmileage, not necessarily time.  If it's a few years old, replace itanyway.  But if not that old, replace after 30,000 miles sincelast replaced.  If neurotic about replacement or don't knowdate of last replacement, replace right away or after somelesser interval like 20,000 miles.  But if you believe thefilter might be in serious need, do replace it at once.This is a sturdy, solid unit but does not include a clip; canbuy that separately or your installer can locate it without a lotof fuss. I recently lost a key fob and decided to order two replacements:  one for my regular key ring and one to just squirrel away with a spare key.  That would bring me up to a total of three identical fobs, as I have a complete key set for both my truck and my car so it doesn't matter which one I'm in... I have keys for everything.They don't tell you in the instructions but you have to program all of the identical fobs at the same time with a maximum of three.  Well, I should have still been OK.  However, no matter how many times I tried, one of the new fobs wouldn't program.  On the off chance it was just a dead battery, I replaced it.  No joy.So while you can't beat the price, it's a crap shoot as to whether it will work or not.  It appears in all respects to be an OEM fob. I'm not sure how accurate this thing is.  I have a new battery but this will show less than 12V after a few hours with the engine off.  It will, however, show over 14V after the engine is started.  I would assume if it stays consistent that you can tell if there is a problem at some point in the future.  I think this is more useful than the factory gauge.  I would recommend getting this type of voltage meter if your battery is getting old. 
Fifty cents wort of tubing and a nipple.  This is a joke.  It now resides in a zip-lock bag in a lower drawer of my tool box, never to see the light of day again. This product restored my black trim on my bumper, fender and side door panels! The only draw back is the bottle is small and if you have a large truck you may want to invest in another bottle. Quality Automatic transmission Filter. Shipped fast, packaged well, and quality direct fitment. Looks the same as the OEM Filter.  Silver metal on one side, and black poly on the other side. If you drop and drain your transmission fluid pan, I highly recommend to change the transmission filter. Quick and Easy to install; pull straight down. 
I put these in my '03 TJ Jeep Wrangler.  They fit perfect and work exactly as you'd expect they should.  I installed a set of 55w HIDs in them and the light output is tremendous. IT WORKS I was frankly stunned bu how well this stuff works. I put it in my 2006 Dodge Caravan and within a mile the shudder was gone. 
Based upon condition of your wheels, the cleaner does require some elbow scrubbing but does a descent job. Hope this helps. I was hoping to use the clay bar to remove water spots on a new truck but the one provided with this Mequiar's kit was worthless for this purpose. The kit does include everything you need to apply the products in the kit which is a plus and probably the reason the kit is so popular. A good buy.  Does the same job that the Honda OEM part does.

I love JB Weld and use it probably once a month.  Some recent projects where I've used JB Weld is to repair a set of my wife's ear rings, my daughter's music box with little ballerina dancers (one of which broke off), and my son's toy motorcycle.  The most money saving repair I've done with this is to adhere the plastic anti-lock break sensor into the middle of the hub of the back wheel on my 2003 Toyota Sienna--I would have needed to replace the entire hub and that would have cost $300+ probably just for parts!  It needed to be able to take extreme temperatures and JB Weld did the trick.To apply, I use a scrap piece of cardboard to mix it on, I split off a piece of shim (or a popsicle stick would work too) to use as a stir stick and applicator, and fix away. I just got the Ramps this week and used them for the first time TODAY on my 2003 Chevy Silverado Extended Cab with a 5.3.  It actually has a 2/4 Drop and 20" Wheels with 275/45R20 Tires.  I was on my Asphalt Driveway,  I put the Ramps right it front of my front tires, Get into my truck, and drove right up them!!! Didn't slip AT ALL.  There is a Rubber Pad in the middle Front, pretty thick, not large,  but it seemed to work for me.  I used to be a Professional Mechanic 3 months ago, and always had access to Racks.  I Changed Occupations for the better, and so I no longer have Rack access.  So I got a set of these.Again my truck is lowered, and so I was worried about a ramp not fitting under the front of my truck to drive up.  I had no problem with these like I said.  I put them right up Against the tire, and then drove right on up!!!  The Negative is it's not UP very high, at least on my lowered truck.  On my Low to the ground creeper, I could just get under to change the oil and oil filter.  I wanted to change the Fuel filter also, but that was ALMOST impossible.  It's along the frame railing back a bit near the front of the Gas tank,  I could barley get back enough to just reach the filter and 2 wrench it with one hand to get the filter off.  I did manage though.  I wish I could of do it on a rack at my old Job, but my old Boss is P.Oed that I left.  Now he has to work far more and hired a couple Idiots to take my place.  I wouldn't get my car worked on there now!!!I'm not going to knock it down any stars because it didn't lift my truck up enough as I knew how much it would raise it before I ordered them.  Again, No slipping for my truck and it's Rear Wheel Drive!!!  It didn't Sink in the Asphalt, or Crack, or anything else.  Nice and Solid.  The Price was right as $48, with no tax and free 2nd day shipping for me.  It's harder for me to do oil changes these days, having to do it at home, but then again, I've seen some of the work so called Pro Mechanics do on peoples cars/trucks from different places, and I think I'll stick doing most ALL that I can, other then things that just isn't feasible for me to do at home.  Things like Smog Check. This little set has come in handy many times with working on our cars. I bought it on a whim but so many times I've been glad to have it around. I even used it on a computer monitor once, zero scratches or scuffs. 
The directions suggest two cap fulls per gallon.  Cutting that in half is the perfect ratio in my opinion.After much research, I landed on this product and I'm happy with the results. No more using the penny or quarter to measure the tire tread. No more second guessing. With this gauge, you can see the actual measurement at an affordable cost. The only drawback I noticed,like some reviewers say, is it leaks oil. While the product applies to the purpose it serves, the packaging is very misleading. Don't judge it by the capacity of its bottle size because the content is only half the dimension of the bottle. It leaves the person scratching his/her head wondering if the volume within is half-empty or half-full. It goes by weight, but then why use such a large bottle (besides it is unsealed) giving the impression that you get a good deal based on the volume. I know the review should only be for the product, but the packaging Is very misleading. 
These refrigerator bars work well to keep your food from shifting around while driving down the road. They are adjustable and have strong springs which allow them to be moved and remain in place. The fridge in our camper did not come with any devices to keep food from moving around and we would often open the door after driving and have some of the contents spill out. These bars will prevent most of that from occurring. I bought this wheel chock to prevent my truck from slipping down an icy roadway during freezing weather at my mountain cabin.  I have to park on the road above my cabin during inclement weather because my driveway is too iced up to drive on.  This roadway has an incline and in the past,  my truck slid backwards on the ice after putting the truck in park and setting the parking brake.  I put this wheel chock behind the rear tire and it keeps my truck from sliding on the ice.  The nice thing about the strap on the wheel is the wheel chock usually freezes to the road during the night and I can pull it loose when I need to remove the chock.This chock is expensive, but worth the extra expense and I am going to order another one so both wheels are chocked I purchased this for a small RV modification. My RV has a pretty clunky means of getting our freshwater hose into the water bay--essentially a removable floor pan that has a corner cut out for the hose.  So you remove the floor pan, route your hose, then replace the floor pan with the corner cut-out allowing the hose to pass through.  The trouble with that is that any bends or movement in the hose results in the floor pan lifting out of place.  I wanted something more secure to keep critters out of my water bay, so I'm using this.  I will mount it to a new floor and then screw that floor down permanently.  I have used these before for water hoses, and though it says &#34;electric cable hatch&#34; it will work fine for a standard RV freshwater hose too. 
The rubber is soft so my vehicle doors are protected from hitting the concrete wall. I used doubled sided adhesive tape and it holds it nice and tight. Great product! This clip holds my EZ-pass perfectly and it is easy to switch vehicles if I want (unlike the Velcro strips).  Once placed on the windshield on clean glass it stays in position.  My car has been really hot in the summer and the suction cups have held.  Putting the clip behind the rearview mirror keeps it hidden and I don't even notice it when driving. Have had these for almost a year on my '13 JK Wrangler. They do a great job in keeping the door frames from getting scratched up and ruined. The glue strips are easily used on the back, by pulling off the protective paper coating, just place them onto the door jam, and hold in place for a moment. They stick in place even without the doors being on the Jeep for most of the year! 
So far working really well.  stuck them to the ground and now the wife can park her car and leave walking room in front.  I just worry that if these every move she will drive right into our kitchen. This works well so I can keep my unit inside the garage yet hook up my vehicle when there is no room to park it inside . I have to batteries in a camper van . I used to have to crawl under and hook it up in winter meaning it didn't always get done . With the proper disconnects attached it is no longer a difficult thing to do . Just make sure the leads can't rub on anything . Very simple to install and very effective.I needed a way to ensure my car was forward enough so i could close the garage door, but of course didn't want to hit the wall in the front.  Now I just pull forward until I can feel my tire push up against the AccuPark and I'm done.  I've got more room on the second garage bay, but may get one just so i can pull up as far as I safely can without guessing. 
These are lightweight universal mats--nothing special.  I use them on top of the OEM mats in my car to protect the OEM mats. These are light weight and do the job, to help stabilizer ground pads from sinking into softer surfaces.  Our stabilizer foot pads are about the same as I have seen on the majority of campers under 7000lbs, so they should do great for most campers.  Do recommend them to anyone looking for such an aid, especially camping in sandy or light soil conditions, and they are durable. Sizes listed in reviews and the two in the description (15.8 x 10.5 x 5, and 12.5 x 9.5 x 7) don't match to what I received...The bag I received is in between what has been listed in the descriptions:  13.5" x 9" x 6" (empty).While seemingly a good quality bag, with a fair amount of straps and attached rain-cover (hidden in the heel of the bag), it seems the manufacturer (or seller) has no idea how to use a measuring tape!The bag itself is quite nice... good padding, rubberized bottom to prevent sliding, small pockets on either side, and zippers seem of reasonable quality.For the price and bag quality, I'm not complaining.  It works great on my CB750, and it does fit on the pillion of my VT1100c2 (without having to remove my rider backrest)  So if you have standard seating (or a touring/adventure style), this bag will do well for you as a pillion bag, and with a little strap adjustments, it also fits vertical on the front or back of a sissy-bar, or horizontal on a larger luggage rack... 
Very good purchase for the money. Very good quality and worth what I paid. Like I said in the title, it's huge. I can get the zippers to about 2 inches apart with a 3X motocross helmet with the visor attached. If I take the visor off, it has plenty of room to spare. I don't think you could find a helmet without a visor that is too big for this bag.I use an &#34;AFX FX-17 size 3X&#34; sold here on Amazon, if you want to see what visor I'm talking about.I like that once my helmet, goggles and gloves are dry I can store them all in this bag. I don't need a gallon of this stuff.  I don't need a quart.  I don't even need a pint... so this was the perfect size to have on hand for occaional small engine reassembly and repair. I ordered these tire irons to change the tires on my Buell Blast, The fact that they include a pouch to keep the Tire irons in is a great addition. I used them to mount my rear tire (Pirelli Diablo) and it really held up to the job. I was think that with the way that I was cranking on these that it would bend, but not so. I would have to agree with other reviews that to have another pack so that I would have 3 Tire irons to use while mounting is a good idea. I know it ups the price a bit, but it's worth it. i did get my tire mounted with just two, but I did notice there was a point where I wouldn't have minded having a 3rd...Great Tire Iron, I would recommend these..

When ordering this ball I didn't realize the dimensions. I know they come in two sizes, but didn't realize how big it really is until I opened the amazon box today...no biggie, it'll still work. If your planning on doing rims or small areas, you should get the little guy! Great buy though....... When I ordered this, I was guaranteed fitment on a Toyota 3S-FE engine. When it arrived, it was not the correct size. i left two stars because I did run out and buy the correct size from another store, however, I didnt want to have to do this when I had all the rest of my parts shipped in. 
these are very nice and flexible the straps are firmly connected.  I foresee many years of service from these covers I have mixed feelings about these bags. I replaced a set of Dowco teardrop shaped sport saddlebags with these. The Dowco's held more stuff and were fairly waterproof, even without the rain covers. I bought these bags in order to match the tail bag I had purchased, since they were a "system" but let me tell you... these things are not nearly as "water resistant" as they are advertised to be. In fact, without the built in day-glo rain covers (which ARE nice to have), these bags allow even the lightest sprinkling of rain in. You better use a waterproof liner if you have anything that needs to be kept dry. IF you have enough forewarning to put the rain covers on, you're good but get caught in a sudden down pour and your stowed gear is damp, at the least. Over all, for the price (and for the fact that all my soft-sided luggage now matches) I'd say it was a good buy. Just be aware of the weather and if you even THINK it's going to rain, deploy the rain covers. These MicroFiber cloths work great!  When it comes to Microfiber cloths, don't skimp out on brand/price. The cheaper ones break apart easily, nor are they as absorbent. 
I wish there was a guide somewhere that shows you what cars these sunshades fit. I bought this one (Super Jumbo) for my Toyota Camry, hoping it would fit. Well, it did not fit. I had to return it, and order the regular Jumbo sunshade. The regular Jumbo sunshade fits the windshield like a glove. Quality is good, and it folds up to about 14&#34;. So, if you have a 2007-2013 Toyota Camry, DO NOT BUY THIS ONE!!! Order the regular Jumbo size.Amazon, can you please look into getting some sort of reference guide that will show customers the correct vehicle application? This would make buying this product a whole lot easier.CPS Very clever idea. Had to use on my 2013 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Sahara with a lift kit and adjustable drop hitch. Spinning ball hitches for different sizes won't work in my case because the adjustable hitch height is a solid piece specific to the entire hitch. In order to tow my 2 different trailers I'd need 2 drop hitches. Interchangeable balls is the perfect solution and I have to say these are perfect. They work well and are rated around 8k pounds of towing. Saved a lot of money here compared to my closest towing accessory store. Bought a new weight distribution hitch that came equipped with a 2&#34; ball ... I needed a 2-5/16&#34; ball for my larger travel trailer but wanted one with the larger big beefy 1-1/4&#34; shank ... my WD hitch had a hole for that size and NO WAY would I go buy a 2-5/16&#34; ball with a smaller diameter shank and use a spacer in it!I want to best thickest built ball and shank and I could not find a ball this size with this larger shank here locally.Price was great and I love having a big bad boy ball and shank to pull the 5-6K load of my trailer.

So, now I change tires myself and these tools are excellent for the job (I use plastic rim shields to prevent rim damage).  Mine have gray handles, but say USA on them, so I believe they are indeed made domestically, which is another big plus. tire repair kit was purchased in the event i get a flat tire having no spare. i got rid of those terrible riding runflat tires and decided to carry a small air compressor and these plugs. just hope i don't ever need either but there's always AAA.

work great for my John Deere X500 Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars 
These did not fit my '08 suburban, the description said w/ 9x3 hook, so I assumed that to be included. It wasn't and I was unable to use these on my '08 suburban. They are a bit slick and need to be sand blasted or something. I would not buy these for any Tire size 15 inch or smaller. Get a 4x4 , cut it, use it. paid $3.17 here ....... cheaper than "wally world". I bought three as these work on my motorcycles. filters the dirt, protect my engine.the "classic" purolator filter is way better than a fram (more pleats of filter media) IMO.I'm using these on a Kawasaki EX 500 Ninja but the L14610 will fit any Kawasaki or Honda motorcycle that uses a cartridge oil filter and has enough room , these are approx. 3.25 inches in length .....Or you can use the L14612 which is shorter (2.5 inches in length).why give your hard earned money for the oem filters which are made as cheaply as the motorcycle manufacturer can buy them and branded with their logo.....crappy filters is what you get from the dealer..... I want my stuff to last, LOL. 
I did not want the ghetto blue look at all ... but wanted brighter and a nice hint of the Whitish look (maybe with a tinge of blue) ... but these really look VERY close to the original basic cheap Sylvania bulbs. I can see a HINT of difference and not totally yellow but really all it adds a tinge (and I mean TINGE) more whitish but still primarily yellow.I saw the Sylvania Silverstar zXe models but the bulbs looked really blue and I thought it would give the ugly blue color so I went with the Ultras .... kinda thinking the zXe's would have given me more of the look I was going for.If you want regular yellow with a SLIGHT hint of white (hardly any) but brighter then stock then these are good ... if you want a more HID look with more whiteish look then go with the zXe's as those should give you more of what you want (I am returning these for the zXe's in hopes they are what I am wanting).I did more research on the zXe models and though the bulb is blueish most all reviews say it is NOT lbue at all ... just really white and that was what I wanted ... I know I couldn't get an HID look from a bulb but I wanted something close and still have the same brightness if not more then the regular bulbs.They are ok but just not the white kinda bright like they advertise and I thought they would be plus the brightness really isn't any brighter to me in my GMC Sierra then the basic cheap Sylvanias we're.Overall totally not worth the money. Using this to paint the shields in a pair of Mini H1's for a retrofit I'm doing, and the color looks great! paid $3.17 here ....... cheaper than "wally world".

Fits a little tight especially around the front fender and floorboards but it works.  I have a 03' Shadow ACE 750cc.  After a couple rain storms I can report my bike stayed dry (except a portion of the front wheel) and through heavy winds, the motorcycle cover stayed put.  What&#8217;s nice about this cover is the price and how it has elastic hooks to secure the cover in place.  If you decide to buy a cover and your bike has a windshield, floor boards and aftermarket mirrors I recommend you buy a 2XL (if your bike is similar in size to a Shadow 750cc).  Look at the picture I posted, mine has stock mirrors and no windshield and fits VERY tight.  My mirrors shift out of place when the cover is on.  Before each ride I have to adjust them cause the cover is soo tight.  Also, if you have floor boards that&#8217;ll make the fit even more tighter.  Buying one size bigger and I would say you bike will be 100% covered. I use it everyday primarily for a storage cover.  I have not had the cover on the bike in rain or weather.  I got the XL for my CBR500R with full large rear bags and windshield.  I can lock my helmet to the rear seat area put the cover on and it will cover up the entire bikes exhaust and 3/4 of the rear tire and entire front tire.  Two bungies mid bike and front tire enable hokking cover under bike.  Very sturdy and breathable with exhaust panels (silver durable material) and inner windshield liner.  Much bang for the buck. Would certainly purchase another if I had to without question. Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones.

work great for my John Deere X500 This was a fraction of the price of the ones at the store and fit perfectly for my 2004 Lexus RX 330 AWD. 32mm is the correct size for my Jetta TDI oil cap, and this fits perfectly.It's also fairly low profile, another plus. 
Very good purchase for the money. Very good quality and worth what I paid. Like I said in the title, it's huge. I can get the zippers to about 2 inches apart with a 3X motocross helmet with the visor attached. If I take the visor off, it has plenty of room to spare. I don't think you could find a helmet without a visor that is too big for this bag.I use an &#34;AFX FX-17 size 3X&#34; sold here on Amazon, if you want to see what visor I'm talking about.I like that once my helmet, goggles and gloves are dry I can store them all in this bag. I don't need a gallon of this stuff.  I don't need a quart.  I don't even need a pint... so this was the perfect size to have on hand for occaional small engine reassembly and repair.

these valve stem caps look good and are as described.  i am happy with the purchase and i am thinking about ordering additional sets for my other cars It's sta-bil how can it be wrong and this is the best price I could find. I am very happy. I wanted some inexpensive seat covers and picked these.  So far they do the job as intended.  Time will tell how they wear and how long they last. As of now I'm satisfied with this purchase.Auto Expressions 5040620 Braxton Grey Bucket Seat Cover 
bought this for my 2004 honda crv.  fit perfectly and cleared the code.  easy to do just give the threads some wd40 It fits perfectly to my 2005 Honda Accord.Filter quality seems to be good. Inexpensive, yet works as good as the ones sold by Honda dealerships. Made true to specs and fits right into the slot on my Accord 2006.Will buy again.

Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. Great Fit They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. 
...fits my 1973 Chevy/GMC 4x4 steering wheel perfect. Stretch it over the wheel and wrap the vinyl string around it nice and tight. The vinyl will break so just stretch it a little. Fits on my Hi-Lift jack just fine. Does exactly what it is supposed to do.If you are using it on wheels that are deep make sure the straps are long enough to reach the spoke pattern. a regular 32mm socket will not fit in the space of my equinox. this is a kind of shorter 32mm socket designed only for oil filter cap job. it works fine. 
These seem well made and are as advertised.  Heavy yes but the construction seems worth the weight.  Look at the mfg weight rating.  While these seem strong enough for automotive work I would be leery for weight limits over recommendation.  I concur with all of the positive reviews. Very sturdy, bright color, well made. This is what you need in a chock although I cannot find a weight rating. These things are rated 8,000lbs but that's for ( GVW ) so while it's correct technically in reality each item is rated by the label at 2,000lbs per each item and if you had 4 (they sell them in pairs), if you had 4 of them you could put 8,000lbs on them, technically and according to them.****I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO RELY ON USER REVIEWS TO GET THE INDIVIDUAL WEIGHT RATING!!!!***GVW is a very deceptive and dangerous way to market and label these products.  Consider this, on a truck, the majority of the weight is on the front two wheels while the rear wheels don't have as much weight - same is true on a front wheel vehicle.  This leads to situations where you could overextend the capacity of these products.I'd like a very clear rating: 2,000lbs, 4,000lbs, 6,000lbs for each stand or ramp on Amazon so that I know how much weight I can safely put on it similar to what is found on jacks....a jack is not labeled as 6,000lbs if it can lift a 6,000GVW vehicle, 6,000lbs means that the jack can lift 6,000lbs!After all, I'm planning to get under these things!!!!On items like this where someone's life very literally depends on the labeling ---  it would be really really really nice (and a legal requirement) that the specifications on Amazon very clearly stated both the operating weight, maximium weight, and crush (failure) weight per each ramp/stand versus this GVW rating which is deceptive and just plain dangerous.I have very literally found people working underneath 8,000lbs trucks without the wheels using jack stands sold as "2ton" when in reality each jack stand was only rated at 1ton or 2,000lbs.....their comment back, "this is a 2 ton stand and 8,000lbs GVW divided by 4 is 2,000lbs or 1ton, plenty of margin."  When in reality 6,000lbs are up front....3,000lb for each wheel  and each stand rated at only 2,000lbs....making their jack stand 150% overloaded! --- horrendously scary (all because marketing is so bad in this area).  Yes people should exercise care in using double protection and users should Always read their instructions and warning before putting their life on the line -- but for the love of God, there is a responsibility on the makers and marketers of these products to label them very clearly and in bold with the weight that EACH can hold and Amazon should post that weight for each item in BOLD Yellow or Orange wording with very clear warnings.Amazon and automotive sellers on Amazon need to get on the ball regarding the needs of auto ethusiasts and for the safety of the weekend mechanic who should not have to do complex math to figure out how much weight each item can hold!We REALLY need to get away from GVW, it's deceptive and dangerous!****I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO RELY ON USER REVIEWS TO GET THE INDIVIDUAL WEIGHT RATING!!!!*** 
Not much to say, they are what they are, and at a great price! These are high quality, and I only use the best in my 2003 Subaru Impreza WRX Sport Wagon. ^^ These are great blades made by Anco.  They are beam style blades that hug your windshield.  They leave a streak free shine and are great in the rain.  They are easy to install and work great.  I can say these are comparable to the Bosch brand blades, and would recommend these highly.  5 stars. Great Item these are factory OEM sensors. they fit perfect and work perfecly. would recommend the purchase of these knock sensors. 
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Perfect fit for rear window on my 2004 Ford Excursion Limited. Easy to install. No spotting seen or squeaking at all Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. 
Fit my '98 Nissan Frontier's oil pan perfectly. Looks to be of nice quality.  Torque to 25ft/lbs (on the Frontier anyway) It a belt... it fits, it hold and it rotates. There is no noise coming from it.Happy with the fit and performance. These item does fit perfect on my 2004 BMW x3. does what its suppose to do. so far so good thanks 
Even though Amazon says it does not fit my truck; it does fit my 2002 Chevrolet 2500HD crew cab with 6.0L gas engine. I replaced both sensors and harness. Both sensors were rough looking and the rear sensor had standing water on it. It was a little bit of a chore to get to them because you have to remove the intake but it was not too bad. I replaced my Honda Fit horn with this disappointment. All the reviewers that said this is not loud were correct.It sounds like the stock horn. This was a waste of time and money. It a belt... it fits, it hold and it rotates. There is no noise coming from it.Happy with the fit and performance.

I am reading lots of bad reviews on these pigtails.  What worries me the most is some seem to be shipping with a different thread type and people are stripping them trying to make them work.  Why the heck can't these be standardized?  I've also read that some come with different sizes of NPT as well as different thread types.  It seems that what is listed is not always what you order, and on top of that, someone like me, who does not know how to recognize the different thread types and sizes won't even know if I received the correct part or the wrong part.I recommend you double check your part number on the hose before installing them to avoid stripping your regulator.I thought, why not use quick connect hoses to connect my regulator to my appliance.  It seems these mate up nice to other quick connects--but only if made by CAMCO, and then these quick connect fittings don't mate up easily to the other parts like regulators etc.  WTF?  I need still another adapter?  And some people tell me perhaps multiple adapters to make it all work?  I'm not going to use three different adapters to mate up a quick connect.  That means I have a huge lunking thing sticking out ready to be damaged, knocked out of place, that is sure to leak out all my expensive propane.Ok, so I called CAMCO.  I wanted to be sure I ordered the right part and spoke to two different people at CAMCO that blew me off.  It seems Camco parts don't necessarily fit each other.  And they don't sell adapters to make them fit. It would be great if they could provide some customer support and perhaps make up some custom hoses to help people make things work.I give this a 1 star because CAMCO's huge fail in helping me put together a system that will allow me to hook up external tanks to my RV.One star also, because they ship different types of hose fittings and buyers don't know what they are getting.Honestly, I'd like to order one of every one of their parts and analyze them.  I'm an engineer, and if I can't figure out what to order, based on conflicting information--reviews that report receiving different size fittings 1/4&#34; npt than specified 3/8&#34; npt, and a multitude of part numbers--and a need for adapters when a buyer should be able to buy everything he or she needs without an adapter---it all tells me CAMCO has not thought out how their products are used.Think about it, there are only so many way propane tanks, hoses and appliances are hooked up. I don't see any need for adapter other than those that attach to the tanks. while amazon normally has a very updated and accurate fitment chart, the one for this item was off. the item was as described, and the picture was accurate of what the item looked like, however fitment showed it would fit my 02 Tahoe with the 5.3 L engine. this is not true for one reason.  - Flex Fuel - if you have a Flex Fuel 5.3 engine the filter is VERY different. you not only need a special tool to release the different type of 'quick disconnect' but you also have to get a different filter. Make sure you do your research prior to ordering from the more accurate fitment charts from the actual brand's website. If you don't have flex fuel on your engine, this should be the right one, and its just a matter of purging the fuel system, and breaking free 2 flare nuts on either side. the change only takes about 10 minutes. make sure you know what you need before ordering. Precise sizes since they weren't listed in any description: .045 .080 .050 .040 .060 .044I used to gap 4 NGK Iridium IX spark plugs. The tool's metal didn't bend. Would buy again. 
I ordered this for replacement from oem gas cap and it fit very good on my Honda with great success It fits perfectly to my 2005 Honda Accord.Filter quality seems to be good. bought this for my 2004 honda crv.  fit perfectly and cleared the code.  easy to do just give the threads some wd40 
Fit my '98 Nissan Frontier's oil pan perfectly. Looks to be of nice quality.  Torque to 25ft/lbs (on the Frontier anyway) Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars Great Fit 
If your working with spark plugs you need this. As standard as they come and guaranteed to work.  Helped me gap my plugs with no problems. If you don't know how to use, just youtube it. I haven't really used it yet for the reason intended, changing the oil in my jet ski.  So, I can't comment on how well it works.  The main reason for this review is to put it out there that it does not work with a 2000 Chevy Silverado.  The siphon tube does not fit thru the bottom of the dip stick tube.  It would be really nice if Mityvac had a published list of what vehicles it works with and what ones it does not.  I have my fingers crossed that it'll work with my jet ski, otherwise there will be a new/(un)used Mityvac on *****'slist.  Long story short, do your research to see if you can confirm or deny if it will work with your vehicle before you buy it. I truly don't know why I waited so long to get one of these. Take the guess work outta knowing weather your tires need replacing or will pass inspection. Can't go wrong with this one. 
I bought this to do the brakes on my Porsche and it does not working very well it's too fat to fit in the space. Does what it supposed to do,Fits most of my scooters.Does not fit a Honda Shadow 750's disc brake, because the disc is too wide.One star less, because the mechanism to mount the pouch to the handlebars is very weak, and impractical (I can't install it on handlebars of scooters because they have the handlebars covered with plastic, and can't install it on the handlebars of my motorcycle, because the hand grips and throttle are too wide, so it does not fit; the pouch also does not have a locking mechanism, so it's kind of moot to try to mount it somewhere).Otherwise, a great purchase! My unit did not come with any instructions.  The tool seems too complicated to be very useful, but does work. 
It fits perfect on my riding mower 18.5 hp B&S engine.Phram is a excellent quality replacement oil filter for my mower engine The tool appears to be of average quality.  However, I returned it to Amazon since it did not fit up to a Ford Taurus flex fuel engine.  This type of engine requires a special fitting that this tool does not have. This is great oil I use RP in all my vehicles from air compressor up to truck. This gear oil works great in my 05 F150's front diff. 
Don't waste your money on Fram filters. Mann filters will not fail you if you plan on a long oil interval in excess of 5k miles.Fit my E39 528i perfectly. It also came with the correct o-ring to seal the oil filter housing. Just buy it already! For about the cost of 3 throw away filters, you get a lifetime filter that provides better air flow.  I was due to replace my filter anyhow, spent a little extra an got this.  It popped into my '07 Altima 3.5 without any tools.  A perfect fit.  There's a decal to add to air intake box so that hopefully future service personnel (Jiffy Lube and the like) won't keep trying to change the filter for you. If your car has, on the driver's side an air foil that is used to help direct air over the blade, this unit is not compatible with that air foil. You should either keep your original and buy the refill rubber strip or buy the OEM unit from the dealer (or online).Otherwise, the blades work well. 
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones.

Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles.

I have previously used in: 1980 Honda CX500C to fix a rough idle, 2000 Suzuki SV650 to stabilize fuel, and a 2005 Chevy Cobalt to fix a problem with stalling at idle. IT WORKS This fit all four O2 sensors on my 2002 Toyota Tundra and I could have not completed the job without this specialized socket. 
It fits perfect on my riding mower 18.5 hp B&S engine.Phram is a excellent quality replacement oil filter for my mower engine This makes it SO easy to charge in conjunction with my battery tender.

the ones I received are not identical to the picture.  one can only be installed on the side and the other can only be installed on the front (or back).  the markings are different for left to right level vs front to back level. I attached these to my travel trailer. This product makes it easy to level both front to rear and side to side. The install is easy, just level your camper using a carpenter level of 3 feet or longer.  Set the level from side-to-side on your smooth flooring or counter top. Then set the level from front-to-back the same way on the smooth flooring or counter top.  Now position the Hopkins 08525 levels, one on the side you prefer to work from at the front of the camper, on a flat vertical surface.  Do the same on a side wall near the front corner on a smooth vertical surface.  Use the double stick tape to position, but consider adding pop rivets or small screws to hold the setting for many years.  Holes are provided in the Hopkins levels.Use the front level first to drive onto leveling ramps or boards, then use the side level along with the tongue jack to finish (after you unhitch). Extend your stabilizer jacks and you're set for level comfortable sleeping in your camper. 
I bought this to look in my winch on my Jeep. I just took one of the bolts out and put this in, I would thing if they really want it I'm sure they can get it out, this just makes it a little harder and if you install two they will have to work twice as hard. And for the price you can buy two.. now if I could remember where I put it. I know ill find it and the put the key in it an put both in a tool bag in my jeep i used it to insulate my headlight on my motorcycle! (i put in an hid light) not the most flexible stuff but can be cut up and set nicely! 
This is everything you need in a tread depth gauge, and nothing you don't. Here's how you use it: You press the &#34;probe&#34; down into the tread gap to measure the depth. You then rotate the cylinder around to match the exact mark to the line. The measurements are on four sides of the cylinder, making them easier to read than being stacked on top of one another. Being able to rotate the cylinder makes it much easier to measure something as minute as 1/32 of an inch. Before installing the level, make sure you are level with the camper first.  Also don't think that a top of one of the storage compartments is level because it isn't.  Once you put on the level, it is very hard to take off.  But I do like how it reads in inches.  It does make it easier to level the camper. Rain-X makes terrible wipers, but you don't need them if you put enough of this on.Tip: don't put it on the side windows, unless you want all the rainwater rushing up into your car whenever you crack them open. 
Use this goop on trailer line connections and when you replace a bulb in any application where moisture is likely.  My Tracker boat trailer has incandescent bulbs and they are encapsulated in nearly water-tight containers, but they do get water within.  They are not meant to be 100% tight so if you replace a bulb, be sure to add some of this stuff to the socket.  Also, the true thief of light is corrosion, not bulb extinction, so apply some wherever there is a vulnerable spot.When changing spark plugs, along with the application of anti seize on the plug threads, use some dielectric grease at the junction of the coil pack and valve cover gasket and at the wire to coil pack. RV orginal hose was leaking from metal to rubber hose area. I had to also buy an adaptor becasue the small end was not the same size. Found one at an RV parts store for .99 cents. This is the kind of spark plug gapper / gap tool you should use when gapping Iridium spark plugs. Simply wonderful. 
I was asked to rewrite my review for some strange reason. I can only assume it was because the person approving my review didn't understand the product or the review.&#34;These work great for the backseat riders. It assists them in climbing up into my 2012 Wrangler. Arrived on time and adequately packaged.&#34;This review is for Rear Seat Grab Handles... their purpose is to give the backseat passengers something to &#34;grab&#34; onto. They are made for Jeep Wranglers. They fit the headrests of a 2012 Jeep Wrangler based on my personal experience with MY 2012 Jeep Wrangler. They arrived on time and weren't all jacked-up, so I can only assume that the packaging was adequate. Ordered this to put on top of my floor jack which was 3" diameter but it did not fit, it was just sitting on top loosely.  So I'm giving it 3 stars, if it fits your application, I'd imagine it would be rated highly.  So it's back to either a puck or wood for me.Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you, it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews, and leave a comment if you have any questions, I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help. I got this when I read the reviews about the lighter outlet blowing fuses. I don't like the clamp quality but they are ok, I can fix anything so if they go bad I will just replace them with better quailty

My G coupe needed an intake air flow replacement pretty badly after I purchased it (despite the fact I purchased it with only 37k miles) and I already knew about the K&N; air filters and I like how it's a one-time purchase deal, no need to buy again when it's filthy.bought the filter, slapped it on, and it has been working flawlessly for a little over 2 weeks now. I combined the K&N; air filter with the popular Z-tube mainly because I was already going to be in there so I figured why not just add the Z-tube for a bit more efficiency. at this point, I have no complaints, I do feel a slight increase in power in 2nd and 3rd (not a 100% sure if it's all from the air filter or with the Z-tube), and rev noise has stayed the same. Arrived on time and in great shape! It does stop the car wheel as it said it would.  As I purchase a new larger auto I only have about 8 inches, (4" clearance for the front and back) left in the garage when I bring in the auto.  A little nervous the 1st time so I S-L-O-W-L-Y inched forward then would stop, get out and look, and repeated a few times until the wheel touched it, then got out and saw I had the 4 " front/back.  Now I drive in normally and it stops me at the location I need... I used this stuff for years in my motorcycle tires and never had a flat in a Slime equipped tire.  I did have two flats (one front, one rear) on a couple of secondary m/c's I had, that did not have Slime in the tires.  That was when I used to change my own tires on the garage floor.  But I have a recent story.  Nowadays . . .Being older and less inclined to wrestle with tire changes myself, I now use a dealer shop to mount my replacement tires. I recently took my Yamaha in for the first rear tire change at 8000 miles.  I had Slime in the tube and the mechanic complained that he couldn't get it to balance and had to install a new clean tube.  OK.  Then . . .2 months and 600 miles later I walked out of a restaurant and there sat my bike on a flat rear tire.  It was a small rusty nail.  And I had not installed Slime in this new tire due to the mechanic caution about balancing.  I got it fixed, but here's my situation nowadays. . .I still am not using Slime pre-installed inside of my tubes. BUT - in my underseat storage compartment, I keep a new 8oz bottle of Slime and a compact 12v air compressor.  I'm going to try from ever again being stranded helpless with a flat.A final comment about running Slime full time, pre-installed.  The manufacturer does not seem to recommend that on highway speed vehicles, and describes Slime as a temporary repair method only.  OK, so that's what I'm doing now, plus preserving my proper tire balance.  However, in my younger more worry-free years I ran tens of thousands of motorcycle miles with Slime pre-installed in my motorcycle tires, and never noticed a balance problem.  I never had a flat either.I'd keep one in the tool kit. 
It does get a bit warm while providing the 5 amps of power to the Koolatron car cooler (which I took into hotel rooms at night), but it did exactly what it was supposed to do so can't complain. One issue: There are two different sizes for so-called "cigarette lighter" outlets. This has the "big" size, which means "small" size plugs can have issues. Solution if that is a problem for your particular plug is simply to use a toothpick to "shim" the small-size plug into the large-size socket. This is one-size-fits-most. It works on the filter for my 2002 Volkswagen Passat, but it's too large to grip the filter on my 1993 Chevrolet S10. Worked well for adjusting valves on my Honda Accord.  Price was right and they had all the standard sizes which are close enough to the metric 
This sunshade is easy to use and folds up to a nice compact size that fits under my seat well. It's a quite large size so is made for an SUV or car that has a large windshield like my Toyota Prius. While it doesn't fit the Prius perfectly, it's the closest size to being perfect.At this price, I have no complaints with this and can recommend it. Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones.

Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. This is one-size-fits-most. It works on the filter for my 2002 Volkswagen Passat, but it's too large to grip the filter on my 1993 Chevrolet S10. 
Well built with a weatherproof cover; comes with two keys and will protect your hitch or what ever you need to protect. Covered my spare which is mounted on my trailer with this cover for improved appearance.  The fabric is nice and substantial.  Elastic keeps it firmly in place.  Also provides UV protection to the rubber. Easy to use. Keeps my trailer hitch safe and secure.Has a cover over the key hole to protect from rain and dirt.

I use it everyday primarily for a storage cover.  I have not had the cover on the bike in rain or weather.  I got the XL for my CBR500R with full large rear bags and windshield.  I can lock my helmet to the rear seat area put the cover on and it will cover up the entire bikes exhaust and 3/4 of the rear tire and entire front tire.  Two bungies mid bike and front tire enable hokking cover under bike.  Very sturdy and breathable with exhaust panels (silver durable material) and inner windshield liner.  Much bang for the buck. Would certainly purchase another if I had to without question. Just got my cover and Im very happy with it. It is very well made and is heavy duty. It covers my Honda Shadow completely no dust or rain will get in with this inexpencive garage. Would highly recommend. This is one of the best accessories I have purchased. It fits perfectly and keeps the heat down in my Jeep. This is great all year round but especially in the summer. The front window is big and the dash and steering wheel get very hot if not covered. I would higly recommend this product for form, fit function and good looks. Carries the Jeep brand also. 
Did not fit my car's filter harness after Amazon's compatibility tool said it would, there was a 1.5&#34; gap compared to the OEM filter, I have a 2006 Honda Civic Si - steer clear of this if you own the same car I purchased this belt for my 2003 Chevy Tahoe. I had no idea Chevy would put 2 serpentines on a newer generation vehicle. This smaller belt fits the A/C system only. It works like a champ and fits perfectly. I would recommend the Gatorback belts to EVERYONE! As an installation side note, you have to remove the air intake and larger serpentine to get to this "bottom of the motor" mounted unit.... way to engineer that one GM! Bought for my new Corvette.  Chevy sells a similar (if not the same0 product for a much higher price.  The CTEK web site shows this unit brand labeled for BMW, Audi, Maserati and Lamborghini so it may well be the unit Chevy buys brand labeled.It has a 4 mode charging system.  The last is a pulsed maintenance mode so it can be kept on all the time for when the car will not be used for several weeks.  Well-made and comes with a bag to hold it and the accessories, that I put on a pegboard hook in the garage. 
it works, but my only gripe is that the hardener should be double the size, as it takes 2x the amount to properly cure this stuff in my experience, which makes the difference between dirt hard and rock hard. My last bottle of wax was Mothers California Gold. To be honest I can't tell any difference between that and the NuFinish either in applying it or the end result. Both are great. dropped right in and made a noticeable difference. Went from about 17 mpg to about 22 mpg highway. The plus is its also reusable.

Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. 
It fits perfectly to my 2005 Honda Accord.Filter quality seems to be good. This fits not only the Ecotec, but newer VW TDI's with the canister filter.  Works great, relatively low profile and goes nicely on a 3/8&#34; drive.  I accidentally ordered three (fat fingered the cart), and sold one to a fellow VW driver and one to a guy with a GM. bought this for my 2004 honda crv.  fit perfectly and cleared the code.  easy to do just give the threads some wd40 
Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.  The pickle fork is the last resort for me, as it will damage the balljoint boot.I prefer to use the Snap On balljoint remover.  If that one cannot fit, then I will try this tool.  If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork. IT WORKS I haven't really used it yet for the reason intended, changing the oil in my jet ski.  So, I can't comment on how well it works.  The main reason for this review is to put it out there that it does not work with a 2000 Chevy Silverado.  The siphon tube does not fit thru the bottom of the dip stick tube.  It would be really nice if Mityvac had a published list of what vehicles it works with and what ones it does not.  I have my fingers crossed that it'll work with my jet ski, otherwise there will be a new/(un)used Mityvac on *****'slist.  Long story short, do your research to see if you can confirm or deny if it will work with your vehicle before you buy it. 
I bought some really bad fuse holders that had some horrible fuses included. I had to replace the fuses with the ones from this ATD. These fuses are great quality and they include all the common fuse sizes which is great. This is a sweet buy when you consider your local auto parts store asks $3-$5 for just a pack of 3 fuses in one size. You get alot of fuses in the most common amperage's. Please note these are just one size fuse, There is still one size larger blade fuse and two smaller sizes. Check what you have before ordering. Personally I got them for my fuse-able links I'm adding for all the accessories I have added to my vehicle. When you do any accessory installs in your vehicle I recommend fusing at the point you tapped power from. Better safe than sorry. When I ordered this, I was guaranteed fitment on a Toyota 3S-FE engine. When it arrived, it was not the correct size. i left two stars because I did run out and buy the correct size from another store, however, I didnt want to have to do this when I had all the rest of my parts shipped in. Have not yet needed to use them, bought them for when I do need them. I am however, very impressed with the quality of the cables. The bag they came in is durable, handy, convenient & good quality. The price was outstanding for these cables. They are low profile to ensure that they do not rub on the wheel well. Only issue I had, was attempting to purchase another set of the rubber tensioner in case one breaks. Amazon did not seem to offer more than one size, which of course was not the size I needed. Most reviews caution you to have an extra, or you could find yourself in trouble if one side breaks. So if anyone knows where to buy extra tensioners, please let me know. 
My last same-sized container anti-seize, standing at attention, lasting me 30 years (home use), so my children will finish this one.About it:It's silver in color, 8-oz. container (a bunch), -65F - 1600F, Anti-Seize, -Corrosion and -Galling; has Lid Brush; label indicates "Made in USA".Specific Use: Ease assembly and disassembly of hardware which experience extreme temperatures and/or corrosive conditions.I've used this routinely, and sparingly for it does not take much - just a light swipe on threads, mating surfaces etc.  Most of my last container went to lubricating boat and boat engine components for very good saltwater corrosion prevention.A general caution is: not apply to business end of sparkplug, O2 sensor etc (lightly on threads/sealing surface only) - else could impact component performance (never seen it happen lol).*UPDATE: I visited Permatex website - wished I'd done so earlier ...

Sadly, its inverter was unable to support my refrigerator. The Duracell DPP-600HD doesn't have enough momentary  output to handle the initial start-up current spike of a refrigerator's compressor motor. The specifications say it can momentarily provide up to 960 watts. This equates to 8 amps at 120v.  Yet, public benchmark figures for a home refrigerator's start-up current indicate 13 amps for up to 1/2 second. Other appliances that use electric motors such as sump pumps are likely to exhibit the same characteristics. My suggestion is that customers immediately test this product with any device they intend to power during an outage.Some important specifications are missing in the Amazon listing.  One of the key statics is the capacity of the internal battery, which is 28 amp-hours at 12 v.  This equates to 336 watt hours.  Yet, AC output is much lower than this presumably due to inverter losses.  These losses increase with power output.  The following table illustrates this.  The last column is my calculation.load.................watts....hours....watt-hoursCordless telephone.....5........35.0 ...175Portable stereo.........10........22.0 ...220Laptop computer.......20........7.0 ....140Fan.......................100.........1.7....17036" TV...................133........1.2 ....1603/8 drill.................300........0.4 ....115Warm-air fan heater.312........0.4 ....109Blender..................385........0.3 ....109HID Floodlights.......400........0.3.....107Observe that the total energy delivered (watt-hour) drops with power consumption.  Ultimately, the usable energy is significantly less than what is contained within the lead acid battery.For reference, a refrigerator will use about 200 watts of electricity when the compressor is running. Typical consumers will have their refrigerator running about 50% to 60% of the time, which equates to an average of 100-120 watts being consumed continuously.ConsDoesn't handle current spikes associated with certain electric motorsProsBoth AC and DC outputPortableSimple operation Be sure to check with the Auto or Truck Manufacturer to find the correct SIZE of Oil Filter for your vehicle. Amazon's Parts Locator says that the Motorcraft  FL820S does not fit my 1995 Mercury Grand Marquis, 4.6 Litre V-8 engine. This is incorrect. The fact is that the Motorcraft FL820S is the FORD-recommended filter for my 1995 Mercury engine, and is recommended in almost every application of the Ford /Mercury/Lincoln 4.6 Litre engine size.The Motorcraft FL820S interchanges with the BOSCH 3410, the FRAM TG2, and the K&N; 2010.The Motorcraft FL820S  has over 50 pleats, high flow rate, silicone anti-drainback valve, and steel end caps.Amazon's current low price ($3.69) is an excellent value for a quality oil filter that's MADE IN USA !!My car is driven in heavy traffic, desert temperatures, mountain driving, and trans-desert trips from Phoenix to L.A.The standard FORD Motorcraft Filters performed just as well as the high-dollar types -- and filtered MUCH better than the K&N;, which has a very high flow rate (for racing), but the low 90% efficiency rating of the K&N; makes it a no-no for extended oil changes. I wouldn't run a K&N; oil filter for more than 3,000 miles -- you'd just be stirring up dirty oil and pumping it through the bearings !! :>(For my American V-8 engine, I have found the best value to be the Motorcraft FL820S Oil Filter and Mobil 1 5-W-20 Extended Life (Synthetic) engine oil. The quality of the oil filter allows for filter changing every 5,000 miles, and the engine oil is changed once-a-year, regardless of miles driven.For maximum oil life, be sure your PCV system is working properly -- Remove and wash out the PCV Valve with Carburetor  Cleaner, and check for collapsed and/or damaged PCV hoses. A leaking PCV system will suck un-filtered dirt right into your engine !!1995 Mercury Grand Marquis RS225 HP 4.6 Litre SOHC V-8Modified Air Box w/ K&N; Air FilterBosch Impeller Fuel PumpBosch 19 Lb.

This makes it SO easy to charge in conjunction with my battery tender.  So far it has fit all my vehicles batteries ( Acura integra, Toyota Tundra, Toyota Pickup ) Nice OEM plugs. Worked well and enhances performance on my '03 Toyota Corolla. I like the factory pre-set gap which allows for easy installation that never requires adjustment feature This scanner does the work it is intended to. And it seems it has to be installed in the car to enjoy it's benefits. But the tip of the cable connection got broken and one has to order another cable.... seems like a common issue from previous reviews 
Comparing all specs against all the other manufacturers.I don't think you will find a better made or better price on a thermostat.Also I might add if you ever have any issues with Stant, they will make it right.Have experience through out the years.They are quick to replace anything exchange etc..Stant has great tech support.. Even without a lot of mechanic knowledge or doing much mechanic work, this item is worth the price. Stick here or there and hear what you can't otherwise. It is great for the person shopping for a used car and you will know when you hear something that isn't right.As for the home mechanic, it is invaluable in pinpointing where things are wrong. Fuel injectors, pistons, valves, anything that moves.And for the computer tech, I have also found this device is great for finding soon to be faulty harddrives. You can hear everything that is going on without disconnecting anything. Long before real problems come up, this thing can find them.As for quality, it really is just a plastic tube with the correct diaphragm at the end to convert the metal pole vibrations to audible noise. Its is FAR better than naked ears, but there are many products out there that are better than this. As valuable as it has been, I would have paid for a better quality version if I were to buy one again. Much better than the OEM plastic idler pulley. Only time will tell if this will last any longer than the OEM unit, but I'm pretty sure it will. Pain in the butt to replace - but if yours is making noise, you'd better replace it soon. I've read too many horror stories about the idler pulley seizing up, and being thrown through the timing cover, damaging the timing belt. 
Installed on my 2006 Rubicon Unlimited. It looks good. It installed cleanly with the supplied hardware and wrench. I like the type of key and the lock opperates smoothly. I feel better knowing it is there to protect my vehicle from gas theft or tampering. Easy to install, be sure and read the directions, was a good fit and installation was easy. Fits well on my 2012 Jeep Wrangler. Nice OEM plugs. Worked well and enhances performance on my '03 Toyota Corolla. I like the factory pre-set gap which allows for easy installation that never requires adjustment feature 
Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.

The 3rd generation powerprobe includes a number of changes for additional flexibility.  In short, it is a vehicle powered DVM with both a 20 foot cable and an additional 20 foot extension giving you a 40 foot working range around either the battery terminals or cigarette lighter outlet, both clips and a plug are included in the kit.With the series 3 units they use a hard gold plated banana jack to hold the removable probe or cables to extend your reach.  If you purchase the accessory kit, it includes piercing probes that self center on a conductor, pierce the insulation, and attach to the jack allowing you to tap a wire at any point to locate intermittant problems.While the DVM is backlit all the time, it also has 2 bright white LEDs facing forward to aid in finding and probing terminals in dark places.  The actual probe is hardgold plated with a sharp tip and removable at the banana jack.  Another identical probe is included with a screw-in female banana jack in the accessories kit to retrofit the powerprobe I and II units to accept external cables and probes.If you need to excite a circuit with a connection to battery ground or to battery positive, the switch allows a momentary connection to bridge the probe tip to either voltage which is useful in testing relay driven circuits, indicator lights, and other small current loads.  The prope voltage is always displayed during testing on the meter. The voltage/ground switch is circuit breaker protected in case you accidentally drive 12 volts into a chassis ground.  Additionally, since the switch takes abuse it is easily replaced if it fails with just a screwdriver.Combined with the testlead set, the powerprobe 3 greatly simplifies testing of vehicular wire and big rigs up to a single trailer.  The DVM has 5 selectable modes of operation designed for different problems.  Reading the manual is important to get the full value from this meter.Although the price is a little high, the design and construction quality are excellent.  Enough wire is provided to check running lights on trailers or to look for blown fuses.  All of the wiring is exceptionally flexible and heavily insulated with top quality connectors.  Both the tester and accessories come in hard plastic cases that can be stowed in a service box.Not mentioned in specifications is that although the probe runs from 12-24 VDC, the meter can be used to measure voltages up to 80VDC. Heavy rubber, good gauge coated snap connectors; comes with variety of components necessary to test different configurations of sparkplug on vehicles/equipment.Has extended accessory to test recessed plugs, such as those on a Ford Triton engine (coil on plug setup).This test set will indicate YES/NO as to 'fire' - not a measurement of current.In sum, if I'm experiencing a miss at idle or under load, and static ohm's are good, and this tester indicates all plugs receiving fire, there is high probability a weak coil exists.  I then pull/reinsert plug wires one at-a-time while engine is running/stumbling to pinpoint faulty plug/wire/coil - (o'skool way).Kyle I ordered 2 different chargers to maintain my gate opener's deep cycle battery (a simple 4 output charger with extension cords for charging other deep cycle batteries from amazonBattery Tender 022-0148-DL-WH 12V 4-Bank Battery Management System) and this unit has a far superior charging design.The 4 bank battery tender does a simple fast rate charge then switches to a trickle charge at a constant voltage with 4 outputs.This unit pulses the battery under charge and features 3 operating modes with different current outputs for different sized batteries. The selections are motorcycle which also works well for SLA gel cells or AGM batteries, standard automotive starting battery, deep cycle batttery, and off.What makes the CTEK unit special is that it uses a pulse charge in all modes to attempt to desulphate batteries, while the battery tender does not.  This method of charging has proven successful in restoring lead acid batteries that won't take a charge any more.It comes with a waterproof 12V output cable and a set of clips or rings for permanent installation under the hood of your car.  In addition to the LEDs for indicating the type of battery being charged, a second set is provided for empty, 1/2 full, and maintenance pulse charge mode.There is also a noticable increase in quality between the battery tender and this unit - small details like a water sealed housing and gaskets on the connectors indicate quality in manufacture.For a single 12V lead chemistry battery this is a useful, well made tool. 
My unit did not come with any instructions.  The tool seems too complicated to be very useful, but does work. It does what it is supposed to do, that is to increase placement distance from the car to the electrical outlet Great wheel lock that is easy to activate and unlock.  It comes with 3 keys, one of which has a LED light on it.  The product also comes with a reminder cord that attaches to the handle bar as a reminder.  It does just what I was looking for. 
I have previously used in: 1980 Honda CX500C to fix a rough idle, 2000 Suzuki SV650 to stabilize fuel, and a 2005 Chevy Cobalt to fix a problem with stalling at idle. Perfect for exhaust work.  I bought it for a catalytic converter and o2 sensor project because it is rated for: -30F to 1800F l've been using Purolator for a while in combination with my 15k mobil oil. protects my cars engine every 10k 
Bought this to install with an aftermarket Kenwood Navigation 7120 on my 08 Toyota Tacoma.  It took several hours to install, but it works great with the wheel controls in my Toyota. Exact fit for Lexus RX300. As easy to install as I could've expected with all parts: the sensor, the cable and  the plug matching the original layout. Perfect fit for rear window on my 2004 Ford Excursion Limited. Easy to install. No spotting seen or squeaking at all 
They are a bit slick and need to be sand blasted or something. I would not buy these for any Tire size 15 inch or smaller. Get a 4x4 , cut it, use it. Sizes listed in reviews and the two in the description (15.8 x 10.5 x 5, and 12.5 x 9.5 x 7) don't match to what I received...The bag I received is in between what has been listed in the descriptions:  13.5" x 9" x 6" (empty).While seemingly a good quality bag, with a fair amount of straps and attached rain-cover (hidden in the heel of the bag), it seems the manufacturer (or seller) has no idea how to use a measuring tape!The bag itself is quite nice... good padding, rubberized bottom to prevent sliding, small pockets on either side, and zippers seem of reasonable quality.For the price and bag quality, I'm not complaining.  It works great on my CB750, and it does fit on the pillion of my VT1100c2 (without having to remove my rider backrest)  So if you have standard seating (or a touring/adventure style), this bag will do well for you as a pillion bag, and with a little strap adjustments, it also fits vertical on the front or back of a sissy-bar, or horizontal on a larger luggage rack... Exactly what I was looking for.  The length of each piece is 2.5&#34; long, so it is already pre-cut to the length you'd need for any job.  Organized nicely separated by bins.  Good product.

This fit all four O2 sensors on my 2002 Toyota Tundra and I could have not completed the job without this specialized socket. 
I love Lynx products, these caps fit properly and do what they are supposed to do. I would buy again. I wish there was a guide somewhere that shows you what cars these sunshades fit. I bought this one (Super Jumbo) for my Toyota Camry, hoping it would fit. Well, it did not fit. I had to return it, and order the regular Jumbo sunshade. The regular Jumbo sunshade fits the windshield like a glove. Quality is good, and it folds up to about 14&#34;. So, if you have a 2007-2013 Toyota Camry, DO NOT BUY THIS ONE!!! Order the regular Jumbo size.Amazon, can you please look into getting some sort of reference guide that will show customers the correct vehicle application? This would make buying this product a whole lot easier.CPS These were a very hight quality product and I received them very quickly, thank you Amazon.  I ordered three to use for a disconnect system on my scooter, they worked great.  I cut them in half and connected them into my lighting system so I could remove the seat frame and the trunk easily. 
I welded a piece of flat stock on the insert for the motorhome. This adapter is for my Dodge Grand Caravan. Perfect fit for rear window on my 2004 Ford Excursion Limited. Easy to install. No spotting seen or squeaking at all They only fit around a standard thickness roll bar not the newer jeep arrangement with the plastic cover shroud of the late models. 
This product appears to include the cable. IT DOESN'T. It's just the mount which it does okay, but you'll have to buy the cable separately. First, you will need to buy the high tone also, or it will sound stupid. It is part #72102. I have put these pair on my last 4 cars. The low tone does have a habit of failing if it gets wet. This has happened twice to me. For some reason, the high tone works fine if it gets wet. Make sure you mount the low tone in a location where it will not get wet.The kit does not include a relay. You may want to install a relay, especially if your car is wired for one horn. The horns draw 4.5A each at 12V. This is usually within factory limits and most fuseboxes will have a 10A or larger relay built in the horn circuit. The kit does include 3 female blade connectors, a mounting bracket and nut, and a jumper wire (needed if your car is wired with one horn lead).And, they are very loud. Packaging declares 130db at 4 inches. I do not have a db meter, but I can assure you the horns will get the job done. The pair has a nice tone, and will rid your car of the little factory &#34;meep meep&#34; horns. Great wheel lock that is easy to activate and unlock.  It comes with 3 keys, one of which has a LED light on it.  The product also comes with a reminder cord that attaches to the handle bar as a reminder.  It does just what I was looking for. 
They only fit around a standard thickness roll bar not the newer jeep arrangement with the plastic cover shroud of the late models. This doesn't fit my 2007 Toyota Tacoma factory hitch.  It needs to be 2 7/8".  The package on this lock reads 2 5/8 but I measured it at 2 3/4.  I'm going to have to grind the bolt.Update, Jan 2014.  An noted I had to grind the inside ends to make this fit in my Tacoma OEM hitch.  Once, it was ground to the proper length, I spray-painted the bolt and have used it to haul a 19-foot trailer and attach my tow hook ever since with no further problems. I purchased this to secure my motorcycle.  I use it on my 1976 FXE Harley's front rotor.  It works well and secures the front with the lock and visible indication to hopefully make the thief move on to another bike.  The only problem I had with it was I wanted to put it on my rear wheel because that makes it much harder for a thief to take the bike.  My rotor's holes are too small for the pin to fit and the throat barely fit due to my rotor's thickness.  It does however fit well on my front rotor.Bottom line, this is a good, low cost solution to add as one additional layer of theft protection for your motorcycle. 
Nice to have something other than a standard flat or Phillips head screw if you have a nice plate frame or even a backup camera mounted over your plates. If your mounting screws go straight into your car rather than taking the lock nuts behind a bracket, these screws will most likely be too big to fit. I just drilled out the plastic pieces that were mounted to my car and then just threaded these in. Ended up with a nice tight fit. Add the little plastic caps for a nice clean look.Cruiser Accessories 82050 Screw Covers, Black Very quick and easy mounting and really adds to the look of the rear of the Jeep.  These are metal and not a cheap plastic and mount with included screws into the existing lens cover screw holes. The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around! 
Looks great, easy install, will help back passengers when top is down, since there is nothing to hold on too, low profile, does not get in the way of view. (Jeep Wrangler 2013 2 door) We use these to put color logos on the inside of the plate for display on the front of the vehicle. Back ground can be painted in on the inside of the plate for better contrast. I attached these to my travel trailer. This product makes it easy to level both front to rear and side to side. 
I bought this to power cordless battery chargers and small bathroom appliances for camping.  One problem.  The manual clearly states it should not be used for any of those purposes.  Testing it with a DeWalt battery and charger confirmed this.  The DeWalt charger indicated a power failure and would not charge.From the manual."Certain chargers for small nickel-cadmium or nickel-metal-hydride batteries can be damaged if powered by this inverter. Two types of appliances are susceptible to damage: Small, battery-operated appliances such as flashlights, cordless razors and toothbrushes that plug directly into an AC receptacle.* DO NOT use this inverter with the above two types of equipment.""Some inexpensive audio systems may produce a slight "buzzing" sound when operated with the inverter. The only solution to this problem is to use a sound system with better power supply filtering.""In no event will PowerBrightTM be responsible for any amount of damages beyond the amount paid for the product at retail."Online descriptions, including the manufacturer home page, give no indication of the above important information.If you are looking for an inverter for the above purposes you will want to look into a PURE sine wave inverter.  Make sure you also review the power requirements on your device before you buy the inverter as well.  Underpowered inverters can be harmful to your devices. Always AC Delco for my GM vechciles!

Needed to replace a broken mirror.  This one fit right onto the existing metal holder that was still cemented to the windshield.  It has a lock-screw to hold it in place.  If you need to replace the metal holder, it is included but no glue is supplied.  Overall, it is a perfectly fine basic mirror. 
Works really well for lubricating car door hinges. The spray can design could be improved, the straw frequently comes out while in use and doesn't fit super tightly. Also, the tapered top of the can with a small cap means that the cap easily gets knocked off and thus the can is prone to leaks when being stored. This is like the icing on the cake for finishing the plates.  I see a lot of nice cars with ugly dealer plate frames and rusted bolts....why why why??  Just remove the frame, get these caps and hide the ugly screws.  :)Make sure your screw heads are not the hex head as it will not fit inside the caps.  Smaller phillips head machine and tapping screws will fit no problem. When your trying to keep small screws from backing out, this is the one.The &#34;Blue&#34; type is still way to strong for small screws, and it will be very difficult to remove them.The &#34;Purple&#34; works great, holds the small screws securely, and allows them to be removed without destroying or bunging them up. 
This dogbone lock is very nice and well buildt. It is perfect for use on any car or truck if you are going to remove it after each use. But it is not for use on a motorhome reciver, were it is going to be left on for some time.The problem is ! The protective rubber cap that covers the key entry, fits loosely. The cap will not stay on to protect the key entry slot. Any little bump in the road, and off it comes !  Dirt and water gets into the lock mechanism, the key will not go in and you will not get it off with out a cutting torch. The &#34;feet&#34; on this bar slides off the truck bed sides and makes it worthless.When the ratchet is extended, the mechanism for that ends up out of arms reach when standing outside the truck. handy. when you go to dump, connect the sewer hose to the dump and then hold the end under the cap. Slowly loosen the gardern hose cap. If either of your blade valves has leaked or been opened you will have some &#34;water&#34; here and you will catch it and drain it into your sewer hose instead of all over the ground in front of everyone at the dump station. Can also be used for backflushing if you're careful and use backflow preventer. 
I use this on the back window of my Jeep Grand Cherokee. It does not flex enough to have full contact on the window. It only has about 8&#34; of contact. I will not purchase this again. The reason I am giving the lock three stars is the lock would not work for our trailer hitch. we have a Lance trailer and the hitch was to wide for the lock to fit over. I may grind down the sides of our hitch so I may use it, I will check with Lance first so not to weeken the hitch if for and reason it may then the reese lock is unuseable for my lance trailer and I will pass the lock on to someone who can use it. I love this unit. Now I know in detail what's wrong with my car before I take it to the shop. This lessens the opportunity that the shop will try to upsell me on a service that I may not need. I also like the idea of being able to log the issues on my computer. I have used it on a 1993 Ford F150; 2001 Nissan Sentra; 3007 Lexus RX350 and a 2001 Cadi Deville 
Easy to replace. It lacks Toyota instructions, but it is exactly like existing Toyota part with all wires colored the same way so it is very obvious how to connect those.The original part has a silicone rubber tube going all the way from top to bottom with wires running inside it. This part only provides a short length of tubing that, at best, would cover half of the length of wires on my car.I thing they should provide a &#34;telescoping&#34; tubing of two diameters with one going inside of the other while you are crimping wires and then extended to cover the full length of wires Truly an impressive assembly of 4 parts. If there is a finer example of a little piece of rubbery roll-y wheel attached to a wooden handle with some metal parts in the middle tying it all together, show me. I like this flexible funnel over others for two reasons:1) Length is excellent and makes it easy to access the filler hole.2) Bottom stopper lets me hang the item for storage without having to worry about excess fluid leaking everywhere.Unlike other funnels, you can't simply stick this in the hole and have it stand on its own due to the flexible tube. However, it does have a small hole in a plastic tab sticking out of the side of the rim which is perfect for threading a small hook or wire through and attaching it to the underside of the hood. All the benefits of a regular funnel with added flexibility and length - perfect. 
Great spark plugs, the exact type my motorcycle required.  Very good quality plugs, gap already set appropriately.  They all come cylindrical cardboard tube over electrode to protect plugs while in the box.  So you have no worries of your box being dropped and cracking your porcelain around the electrode.Very clean, crisp threads and installed in motorcycle heads with ease.INSERT tip:  using a 3/8" rubber hose approximately 6-8" long, slide it over the top end of plug and use to insert plug into place.  If you begin to cross thread during insertion the rubber hose will slip around plug.  Whereas, with a ratchet one might be apt to keep tightening at this point, thus ruining the female threads in your cylinder head.ChrisEastern NC The quality of this tool appears good. Fit and finish are nice, and the steel base looks forged and not cast. The screw turns smoothly even if the handle is a bit sharpHowever the throat of this tool is not deep enough to get over what look liike normal sized wiper arms on my 2012 Jetta SportWagan. When placed on the arm the center of the threaded rod only reaches to the edge of the wiper arm stud. I got the tool to work but it involved leaving the wiper arm nut on the stud about 4 turns loose and placing a thick steel washer on top of the nut to make a flat surface for the puller stud to press against.

They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars 
I'm a newbie RV person (though I'm 74 years old) so took advice of others on blogs and ordered a 25' and a 50' hose for my new travel trailer.  The threads on the female end are plastic so I'm hopeful they will hold up.  They do have a 10 year warranty.  I unrolled them today and had no kinking when I carefully stretched them out.  Since they were wrapped tightly for shipping I assuming under normal use they will serve their purpose well. these valve stem caps look good and are as described.  i am happy with the purchase and i am thinking about ordering additional sets for my other cars I am happy with this purchase. I already knew these magnetic part pans are excellent. If you will use it a lot, get one. 
BACKGROUND:Our travel trailer came with baggage door catches on all of the exterior compartments except for the largest one at the rear of the trailer. After struggling with this compartment for one summer with bungie cords and whatever else, I decided to install a proper catch. Half of the challenge was trying to figure out what this part was called but I guess if you made it here you've figured that out already!MY EXPERIENCE:The door catch itself seems well made. Contrary to the previous reviewer, mine was very white (much whiter than the "white" siding on the trailer). My main complaint is that there are no directions and no mounting fasteners. I installed it by drilling two holes in the fibreglass siding and then using some drywall type anchors (the kind where you insert the plastic plug first and then turn in a screw to expand the plastic plug). There also was no sealant or gasket so I siliconed the backside of the door catch before installation and then siliconed around the door catch after installation. Is this the proper way to install it? I have no idea. I just hope it lasts. In the past I have used coarsely threaded screws carefully place into the seal and a pair of &#34;lock pliers&#34; to pull the seal out. These are certainly a step up from my previous method. This simple tool seems to be well made. We thought this looked like a great way to keep the bugs out...as I am forgetful about returning the slide back after opening the screen door.  We travel a lot with 2 other couples who had me order one for each of them.  We all have installed them on our RV's and other than the initial inconvenience of not having a 9/16inch drill bit we like the results. It does take a little patience to round out the whole so the rubber grommet will fit correctly...and important to follow the directions carefully! But hey that's the joy of RV ownership!!! 
No more "nagging" to close the screen door! You could probably buy a spring at your local hardware store for about the same price, but the pre-determined install tension (distance to drill holes) and where to mount the spring(s) makes it well worth the $7. I followed the instructions for screw hole distance and only needed 1 spring. Both springs may pull the door past the latch at rest (without door swinging closed), but a normal entry/exit the single spring has enough to overcome the latch without slamming the door. You have to have this. Mounts most typically on the outside of the RV.. Just tilt the outside door/vent open and Olsen the peacock valve. No tools required!  Very cool! There is no need to lower muffler, just let it cool then install the hitch. You may also want to purchase the bracket for the trailer wiring flat 4 connector . (Hopkins 48595 flat 4 bracket) 
Easy to install, be sure and read the directions, was a good fit and installation was easy. Fits well on my 2012 Jeep Wrangler. I bought this to go on the back of our camper bumper.  Very well built and easy to install.  Easy to adjust if needed.  Highly recommend!!!! Super easy to install.  The only tool was a small screwdriver to remove the old one.  This one just snaps into place

IT WORKS Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.  The pickle fork is the last resort for me, as it will damage the balljoint boot.I prefer to use the Snap On balljoint remover.  If that one cannot fit, then I will try this tool.  If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork. bought this to use with a signal generator, and works great.  does just what I need.  will buy another if needed. 
Hella Replacement.  Kinda.  Mine came with BLUE wire.. they should always be white. Its also not covered in fabric and the white ones are. Made my steering wheel turn smooth.Flushed my 08 bmw 328i at 80k. Old fluid came out pitch black and this new fluid is pink. My Harley has a lot if black on the motor. It's a 2003 and very gradually the black will loose it's rich dark look. This product really brought back that dark rich look. I recommend it. 
Considering these stands cost about four times as much as a lot of others, and considering the five star reviews, I was expecting perfection.  Unfortunately, they have design flaws.First, the packing sucks.  Two stands come packed together in one box with bits of cardboard that are supposed to prevent the two stands and the two separated stand arms from rubbing together.  I'm not sure if they scraped through the cardboard or if it just shifted, but all of my stands have scrapes on them and in one place the metal is rusting where the paint was scraped.  The manual says if you see rust to scrape it off and repaint it.  I shouldn't have to do that when they're new due to bad packing.  Also, the scrapes reveal just how imperceptibly thin the paint actually is.The description says "Formed base adds stability and helps reduce sinkage into pavement".  When I think "formed base" I think formed as one solid piece.  Instead, the base has tiny triangles of metal welded to the _inside_ of each foot.  Then they carefully take a picture of the stand so you can't see what they did till you get it.  That would still be acceptable except they made no effort to level either the feet or the triangles.  On many of the feet, the triangle sits too deep in the foot so it wouldn't even touch the pavement until the foot edge had dug into the pavement.  In other cases, an edge of a crooked triangle will form a divot in the pavement before the rest of the foot or triangle touches ground.  They could have splurged for a tiny bit more metal to make the triangles large enough to rest the edge of each foot on the triangle, then set the whole thing on a flat surface while the triangles were welded.  I've seen other stands with that design.One of the other reviewers mentioned that the arm that locks the stands at a particular height doesn't move very far and so it's hard to tell by looking if the lock is engaged.  I agree this is a problem and I wish the teeth were deeper so it was easier to tell when a locking arm was fully engaged.  However, it's probably not really an issue because the weight of the yellow bar and the shape of the teeth and locking bar will force the locking bar to fully engage.  Even if the locking bar is rusty enough to prevent the weight of the yellow bar from fully locking it, the weight of the car certainly will.  I could possibly imagine a case where the tip of the locking bar is barely touching a tooth of the yellow bar and putting weight on the yellow could cause a failure, but I couldn't get it to sit like that when trying, so it's pretty unlikely.  However, as the jacks get rusty and teeth possibly wear, or if you simply get one with a small manufacturing defect, such a situation could become more likely.  So I'm not a fan of this design where locking can't easily be confirmed visually.  Even if they had made it so the locking arm sits perfectly horizontal while locked and an inch off horizontal when unlocked it would have been better.While doing my tests with the locking bar I created quite a bit of shaved yellow paint particles just from moving the yellow bar up and down by hand.  This is probably typical of the paint used on jack stands and maybe there's no avoiding it, but it certainly doesn't seem that they used any sort of premium paint.  The coating of yellow paint does seem to be thicker than the coating of blue paint, at least.I don't think the description (or the 3-ton label on each stand) makes it very clear that the 3 ton rating is per PAIR, not per stand.  You have to read the manual to find that out.  They also have big warnings in two places in the manual not to put a car on four stands.  Since it's fairly common for people to put cars onto four jack stands, I don't know if that warning is just there to cover their butts in case someone lifts a car wrong onto four stands and it falls over during lifting or if there's something about these particular stands that makes them bad for using four at once.  Perhaps the bases are just too small.  Of course, using four stands in earthquake country is just asking for trouble so that could be another reason.In case anyone was wondering, these stands only lock at a particular position.  Just because the description says "ratchet" doesn't mean you can ratchet them up while the car's weight is on them.  If you manage to move the locking bar with the car's weight on the stand (which actually shouldn't be possible due to the shape of the teeth), the stand will collapse to its lowest level. This is actually a solid chunk of rubber. I originally thought it was foam (like a keychain float) but it is a very hard rubber that fits very snugly over the Hi-Lift handle bar. It is much looser over the I-beam part, and the hole for that part is shaped very weirdly (to fit over the top clamp, which I don't have on my Hi-Lift because I have a JackMate&#8482;).It holds the handlebar perfectly parallel to the I-Beam, though, which looks alot nicer than the bungee I was using, and it stops vibrations well. I also like how it is embossed with &#34;Hi-Lift&#34; on the side. This is like the icing on the cake for finishing the plates.  I see a lot of nice cars with ugly dealer plate frames and rusted bolts....why why why??  Just remove the frame, get these caps and hide the ugly screws.  :)Make sure your screw heads are not the hex head as it will not fit inside the caps.  Smaller phillips head machine and tapping screws will fit no problem. 
Purchased this as an OE replacement per the factory manual for a Honda powered snow thrower and it works just fine! Just a spark plug, fits my Chinese scooter engine (I have a TaoTao ATM50 A1), but there are many brands using this same Honda clone engine.Has a small center pin, and the right gapping from the factory.Supposedly lasts a long time, can't say as I use it as a backup plug. California 2000 V6 Camry with P1150 and P1155. Two of my code tables show as Bank 1 Sensor 2 A/F sensor so I ordered the Denso 234-4209 O2 sensor. Came in on time and package well protected but looks like its the wrong one - my fault, somewhat. Turns out, as far as I could tell, my two tables from two different sources had it backwards as it should be Bank 2 Sensor 1 A/F and Denso/Amazon order check didn't help much either.Anyway, Bank 2 Sensor 1 is the one on the engine right front (easy to get to) where Denso refer as Upstream Front. I gave it 5 stars base on previous experience, will order this one later.Why the a few of you refer as Bank 1 Sensor 1 and still corrected the check engine light? That would not be this one for the the Toyota V6 but Denso 234-9007 where they refer as Upstream Rear. Am I wrong?Seems like I'm not the only one confused based on superceeded information on P1150 and P1155.This one is for Bank 2 Sensor 1 for the Toyota V6 engine (mine is the 1MZFE).

So, I can't comment on how well it works.  The main reason for this review is to put it out there that it does not work with a 2000 Chevy Silverado.  The siphon tube does not fit thru the bottom of the dip stick tube.  It would be really nice if Mityvac had a published list of what vehicles it works with and what ones it does not.  I have my fingers crossed that it'll work with my jet ski, otherwise there will be a new/(un)used Mityvac on *****'slist.  Long story short, do your research to see if you can confirm or deny if it will work with your vehicle before you buy it.

If you're looking at this, you know what it is. If you know what it is, you're buying the best by buying PowerProbe. Love being able to send power or ground to anything. Really great for confirming fuel pump concerns and similar. I ordered this set of mirrors to help me see behind my camper.  They are very easy to use and are very firmly mounted.  IMPORTANT: Go to the manufacturer's website to find the exact model for your truck.  The Amazon site might tell you the wrong model for your truck.  I recommend this product. Amazon is the best place to buy these. They are cheap and always available, and the same quality that you get from the dealership or online suppliers. I believe they are actually SLIGHTLY cheaper on some online sites, but you have to pay shipping. Thank you Amazon!I don't know why people give this filter a bad rating when it is their own fault that they bought the wrong one. Do you homework, make sure this is the one that fits your vehicle, and you will be quite happy. There are many online resources that give the filter item number that is comparable with your car.If you get the right one, this is the only place you should get your filter. 
These were a perfect fit for my 2001 Silverado 2500HD with the 6.0 but I had to do some research to make sure I bought the correct wire set.  GM used round or square coils (two different manufacturers) for a few years and the plug wire lengths are different. If you have the round coils (plug wire connector on the bottom of the coil) you need these shorter wires ending in &#34;GG&#34;.  If you have the square coils with the plug wire connector on the side of the coil, you need the longer wires ending in &#34;HH&#34;. The HH wires are about 1.5 inches longer for than the GG's.  You cannot make the shorter wires reach a square coil. There are two horns, not one. One is 400Hz and the other one is 500Hz.PIAA | Automotive Sports Horn (400/500Hz) #85110The are exact fits on the mounts as the OEM horns and use the same bolts. A 1/4 inch drive ratchet and a 12mm socket is needed to remove and install the bolt. They came with grounding leads with ring spade lugs that mounted readily under the existing M6 bolts on the radiator supports. All you need is a 10mm socket.The two wiring harness leads are too short to connect the horns. Two wire tie mounts hold the harness to the aluminum bumper reinforcement. You can cut off the ties and use the OEM harness to connect the horns, but I chose not to.  I prefer NOT to cut off the OEM connector blocks.I made two pigtail extensions out of 18 gauge black primary wire, 5 inches long. One end needs a 1/4 inch wide exposed male quick disconnect. The other end needs an insulated female 1/4 inch quick disconnect terminal. Since I used 18 gauge wire, I used the red coded ones.The exposed male connector slides into the OEM horn connector perfectly. The female one clips easily onto the positive terminal of each horn.The horns how have a weather shield on the apertures.Best thing to my surprise is that they appear to be very high quality and Made in Japan.Also nice is that they need no modification to the horn relay or circuit. The wire used to make these test leads was not test lead wire; It is much stiffer. When attaching the leads to small circuit boards, you may need to support the leads so they do not tip the board on an angle. 
The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around! As good as the factory original. Thanks for the tip from one of the other reviewers to drill a small hole in the top of the cap in order to attach the existing leash. (It doesn't come with one) Easy to replace. It lacks Toyota instructions, but it is exactly like existing Toyota part with all wires colored the same way so it is very obvious how to connect those.The original part has a silicone rubber tube going all the way from top to bottom with wires running inside it. This part only provides a short length of tubing that, at best, would cover half of the length of wires on my car.I thing they should provide a &#34;telescoping&#34; tubing of two diameters with one going inside of the other while you are crimping wires and then extended to cover the full length of wires 
GM has two different coils for this vehicle so their fit index isn't correct. One wire set is an 1.4 inches shorter. See other reviews for info. With the right part, they went right on and work as intended. These were a perfect fit for my 2001 Silverado 2500HD with the 6.0 but I had to do some research to make sure I bought the correct wire set.

You cannot make the shorter wires reach a square coil. The Tender Jr. does not come with a cigarette adapter so I cut this in half to make two. I purchased 2 lighter plugs for a buck each from China&#8230; with free shipping&#8230; and they are working fine. These aren&#8217;t an exact match with the Tender cables but they fit together OK and are easy to determine polarity with the wire colors. You can also just use this as an extension cord for your Tender. The description states a length of 12-inches&#8230; but it&#8217;s actually 14-inches tip-to-tip on the connectors. Nice item for the price and it&#8217;s made in Mexico. 
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. 
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Fit my '98 Nissan Frontier's oil pan perfectly. Looks to be of nice quality.  Torque to 25ft/lbs (on the Frontier anyway) work great for my John Deere X500

That's according to Amazon.YES, IT DOES FIT MY 2012 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab.I don't know what that white powder is on the rubber seal, but I cleaned it before installing the cap.  No error codes and no gas stolen so far. 
I bought these to change the tires on my GSXR. These tire irons are bigger than they appear to be. The description has them listed as small tire irons but the ones I received are 18 inches long from tip to tip and about 11.67mm thick (see pic). The thickness and the fact that these irons have a handle means you can place maximum pressure on them and they won't bend. The end has an s tip that gets under the tire and makes it easy to lift the tire over the rim. These are well made and will last a long time. Evidently these are meant for use on cars ONLY. They are too small to fit the coil springs on my '11 Silverado. Otherwise I guess they are decent spring compressors. Fits on my Hi-Lift jack just fine. Does exactly what it is supposed to do.If you are using it on wheels that are deep make sure the straps are long enough to reach the spoke pattern. 
Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!! These worked for my 2005 jeep grand cherokee.  I like how these bulbs will replace any of the three rear lights. They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. 
Excellent product that is very easy to install.  READ THE INSTRUCTIONS!  Each level has a proper place to be installed - one on the side and one on the front/rear of the trailer.  They are marked which goes where and designed to give accurate readings of the level of the trailer.  Great product!!! I attached these to my travel trailer. This product makes it easy to level both front to rear and side to side. The pair of levels are a great value.  I recently purchased these for a second time, as the originals were sold with my previous trailer and I wanted to make my new trailer easier to get on a level stance.There really isn't much to go wrong as far as product failure is concerned.  Accuracy is up to you with the initial installation.Recommended method of installation is to get your trailer level/RV, front to back, and side to side.  Once you have your trailer true, install the graduated levels in locations which will show you front to back level (placed on the side of the trailer) and side to side (place on the front or back of the trailer).  Make sure the bubble indicates "level" by being in the center point of the tube.Installation should be done once all your components are "stressed" as they will be for trailer/RV use (I.E. front tongue on a travel trailer, all the normal weight sitting on the winch foot, or in the case of 5th wheels/motorcoaches, landing gear down), try to place the levels on the RV in clear view of the winch/landing gear controls to enable leveling without having to relocate to a different location to view the levels.I accomplished this on a travel trailer by placing one level on the very front center, and the other on the side of the frame tongue close to the winch.  Though small, with sharp eye-sight, you can take advantage of the one on the front of the trailer as you position the trailer to see if you can establish a level side to side stance as you near your desired location.On my 5th wheel, my landing gear controls are on the front corner of the main body.  I placed one on the side of the rig for front to back level, and another right around the corner on the front side (for side to side level) still within sight of the controls, as well as from the truck cab for backing up.  Even though the level is off center, if it is installed properly with the trailer level at the time of installation, it will work fine.As far as the graduated scales are concerned, you will have to find your "scale" for adjustments, as it depends on where the levels are placed in reference to the center of the pivot points.The levels come with a self adhesive foam strip on the back for placement as well as two holes for screws if you wish to drill holes in the side of your rig.  I go with the adhesive strip route, as I don't like unnecessary holes.  The only negative with the adhesive strips is they will flex if stressed and it can put the levels off level, though this only happened to me with the first pair after the foam tape aged a few years.One last comment . . .the green bubble tube will fade from extended UV exposure.  It will not interfere with the accuracy, just makes it a little harder to read.If you are looking for larger levels which can be read from a distance, I know they are out there, but I have no experience with them to make a comparison.  I do not wish to clutter the appearance of the rig with large levels. 
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. This product does not fit your 2012 Toyota Tacoma! That's according to Amazon.YES, IT DOES FIT MY 2012 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab.I don't know what that white powder is on the rubber seal, but I cleaned it before installing the cap.  No error codes and no gas stolen so far. 
The Tender Jr. does not come with a cigarette adapter so I cut this in half to make two. I purchased 2 lighter plugs for a buck each from China&#8230; with free shipping&#8230; and they are working fine. These aren&#8217;t an exact match with the Tender cables but they fit together OK and are easy to determine polarity with the wire colors. You can also just use this as an extension cord for your Tender. The description states a length of 12-inches&#8230; but it&#8217;s actually 14-inches tip-to-tip on the connectors. Nice item for the price and it&#8217;s made in Mexico. On certain fastener applications, where there is vibration and on rubber bushings, this is a must. make sure you are tightening the bolts to ther correct torque specifications. Easy to replace. It lacks Toyota instructions, but it is exactly like existing Toyota part with all wires colored the same way so it is very obvious how to connect those.The original part has a silicone rubber tube going all the way from top to bottom with wires running inside it. This part only provides a short length of tubing that, at best, would cover half of the length of wires on my car.I thing they should provide a &#34;telescoping&#34; tubing of two diameters with one going inside of the other while you are crimping wires and then extended to cover the full length of wires 
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Great Fit 
I repaired damaged exterior redwood house siding with Bondo in many places where bushes and trees had rubbed against the siding for decades, leaving deep, sweeping surface mars, some over 2' long and 1/2&#34; deep. Worked perfectly. Also great for patching holes in anything( yes, that includes cars). One car guy I know took 300 lbs of lead out of an older car repair and replaced the lead with Bondo saving that 300 lbs, the weight of two people(or one beer-gut from Wisconsin)! An instant gas mileage improvement.Bondo is nearly a wonder material if used correctly, and that is to use as little filler as possible. In metal, bring the repair surface as close as possible to original, then use Bondo to smooth. Use like putty in small wood and soft material repairs, but for larger and deeper repairs, drill small 1/4&#34; deep anchor holes at differing angles in the bottom/sides of the hole for the Bondo to &#34;grab&#34; onto.  It will then never come loose or fall out.  All craft work is deserving of our best efforts. Give it the respect it deserves by doing your best, and by using the best tools and materials. It's beyond me how others think they should have gotten 4, or one reviewer thinks she only received one.  It's clear from the description that this is a PAIR of wheel chocks, not two pair, not one chock.  The 2 are NOT "screwed together" as mentioned in another review.  The manufacturer attaches them with a plastic fastener called a "christmas tree."  It's similar to the plastic fasteners that hold interior door panels on a car.  This is removable; the 2 chocks are separated for use.  Granted, it's a little difficult to pull them apart, a pair of pliers helps.  It would be dangerous to leave the 2 wheel chocks attached as shipped to try to prevent a car or RV from moving.Now for some actual, useful information about the wheel chocks.  I bought these to stabilize my cars when jacking them to service brakes, tires, etc.  My garage floor is painted with epoxy paint.  Even with the anti-slip additive in the paint, several other wheel chocks I have tried always slipped and moved on the epoxy floor.  These Blitz Tire Hugger Wheel Chocks have held firm on the floor every time.  As with any wheel chock, it's important to make sure it's firmly wedged between the tire and the floor.  A quick firm kick to wedge the chock in place is all I ever need on my slippery garage floor.I don't think these would be useful outdoors on an unpaved surface, such as with an RV or trailer in the woods.  But then, it dozen't seem that's how they are being marketed anyway, and I haven't tried them in this application.  For working on a car with a jack or ramps, these chocks do the job. Great cover! I put it on in minutes after delivery and warming a little, and it is not moving; low 80's outside today but likely over 110F in the car. I do not have sweaty hands and it does not look like color came off. It is smooth leather and is dyed black, much like belts and shoes, which can rub off on contact (belts do after repeated hand-contact and probably stain the inside of belt loops without our knowing). For those with sweaty hands get a rubber-cover with grips (stinky) or vinyl (slippery) but neither are very durable in hot cars; you won't be as happy with the comfort unless it is leather. Non-leather will smell toxic or be slippery, but it will not bleed color. If your hands sweat they may slip on vinyl or smooth rubber. This product has a great grip and feel and leathery smell.There is an inner rubber-sleeve )non-smelly) that prevents the cover from moving. I set the product in the sun for about 5 minutes and it made it ply-able enough to work it on. I recommend starting with the center-most seam on top of a straight wheel(there are 3 seams at roughly 12,4,8 O'clock), carefully work the outer edge over the wheel and down both sides evenly (the first 3/4's is easy), use patience and care, then roll the edge into position. If it is off-center it cannot be slid sideways. Take it off carefully and begin again with it more centered and work each side evenly; a little here, a little there. Do not put this on cold or stretch without warming; it can damage/crack/tear cold leather.I placed this on a 15" 2008 Chevy Aveo5 steering wheel (do measure your wheel diameter before ordering). The only con to these types of covers is they cannot wrap the inside, so the fingers feel the outer edges of the cover; in this case it is smooth, rolled, and well stitched and I have gotten used to it. It is probably made in China at this price but it looks and feels like good quality. I recommend this and would choose to buy again and recommend to a friend. I also recommend a little leather conditioner on this, much like one would use on leather car interiors. It is smooth leather, not suade or roughened.In 'the old days' I bought wrapped 'stinky' vinyl, and used vinyl to thread through holes and wrap around the cover with tension (still available) and it filled the inner part of the wheel. It was difficult and time-consuming, and, the vinyl strings eventually breaks. I recommend this 'new and improved' version. Rubber and vinyl degrades in heat and UV. Did you know that wonderful 'new car smell' is highly carcinogenic, expecially when hot, and all the glue they use on carpeting and interior fabric, also. This has been well known and accepted for over 50 years but it sells cars. FYI. 
The install is easy, just level your camper using a carpenter level of 3 feet or longer.  Set the level from side-to-side on your smooth flooring or counter top. Then set the level from front-to-back the same way on the smooth flooring or counter top.  Now position the Hopkins 08525 levels, one on the side you prefer to work from at the front of the camper, on a flat vertical surface.  Do the same on a side wall near the front corner on a smooth vertical surface.  Use the double stick tape to position, but consider adding pop rivets or small screws to hold the setting for many years.  Holes are provided in the Hopkins levels.Use the front level first to drive onto leveling ramps or boards, then use the side level along with the tongue jack to finish (after you unhitch). Extend your stabilizer jacks and you're set for level comfortable sleeping in your camper. Although my camper is a pop up hard sided unit, it has a scissor jack at each corner with small pods attached to the jacks to keep the camper from rocking. These pads keep the camper feet from sinking into the ground and help to keep the camper level and eliminates rocking. They are easily cleaned if you put the waffle side up and let the smooth side touch the ground. I attached these to my travel trailer. This product makes it easy to level both front to rear and side to side. 
This great product keeps all of my gas powered vehicles and equipment running great. I absolutely love it! Thank you! Purchased several to keep the batteries charged on my classic cars. They work very well and the price is right! Highly recommended. bought this to charge / maintain spare batteries not in my truck, worked perfectly.great product,would buy again.good service.fits battery tender. 
They are as described. I removed the double sided tape because I wanted to use a flexible silicone along with the screws to permanently mount these to my travel trailer. Now I no longer need to get out my 4ft level when I arrive at the camp site. I got my rv level and checked it using bubble levelers in several locations. Once it was for sure completely level I put these on the front by my electric tounge jack where I can see them when I am leveling the trailer. one is positioned for the side to side level and one is positioned for the up and down front and back level.They work great. I cleaned the area really good with alcohol and used the adhesive backers they came with.You can drill holes and screw them on but I do not like drilling holes if I do not have to.They have been on there for some time now and if they start coming off I will just get some 3m command strips or just get new ones since they are not that expensive. This unit works well.  I used the supplied foam mounting tape and overnight the unit fell off the wall.  I remounted it with 3M foam tape and it has not moved in several months.  I would not mount it over a vehicle using any type of mounting tape.

I was suprised how well and how easy they worked even on an extended van.  It saves wear and tear on the shoulders. I actually was very surprised how how well these work. I was not sure about these at all but I loved how well and easily the wipe away the wax. Once done the paint on my car was soo smooth and silky to the touch. I dont like the thick gel type dressing as they are prone to sling all over the side of the car.This product is thin enough that you can apply evenly using a simple foam pad.  I can achieve a nice natural finish, or very glossy by adding more product. 
I used a turkey baster with measure to take out 16 oz of my coolant then filled radiator back with Purple ice. after a test run around the neighborhood, i touched the coolant hoses and they were HOT, i had no thermometer with me but i check up on the temperature constanly after i do work on my Pathfinder, and the hoses were way hotter then normal. Now this might be counter productive thinking but it makes sense. By having the Coolant increase its temperature, that increase in temperature is going to be direct with the decrease in temperature in the engine block as the coolant's heat transfer ability increases. I have no numbers as of yet, but i know for a fact, this product works even if it might be for 10 or 15 degrees, and for such a low price, Purple Ice has my recomendation. This level indicator works great on cool days (65-80 degrees, outside).  I use it on the a-frame of my 34 foot trailer.  On hot days, the water inside the level expands to such a degree that the bubble is no longer present.  When I first experienced this, I thought all the liquid had leaked out.  The next morning, when it was cool outside, the bubble had miraculously reappeared!  As a result, I cannot depend on this level to keep my trailer level.  It might work if I had not permanently installed it on the A-frame (kept it cool until I needed to use it) but, being exposed to the hot Utah temperatures makes this level undependable. If you have a RV, trailer or any unit that has a waterpump in it, this is a must!!!!!!. The 2 way toggle that attaches to the input side of pump. You Then switch the toggle valve off the fresh water tank toward hose and pull RV antifreeze directly from the gallon bottle you buy at store for storing you unit before the winter. Simple follow install instructions that comes with package ( very easy to do for almost anyone)Here is how I do my units***Once installed simply move valve to direction of antifreeze hose. Make sure all facets are off before starting anything, turn on water pump switch in RV unit and I go to each cold water side of facuet**** till water/antifreeze comes out pink .....I do all cold side facets first.NOTE*You must ((((empty)))) hot water tank before storage every season or if water freezes in water tank or it will crack your 6 gallon tank and make you replace hotwater unit.Once that is complete I allow just enough antifreeze to flow to tank and out of open plug where I see pink color and quickly shut off pump. Then I turn off Hot water by- pass switch most RVS and trailers have them standard past 10 years. If you do not have one on your unit they can be installed.( if not I would have one installed Amazon sells that kit as well or you can just run enough antifreeze into tank to cover bottom where left over water will lie and freeze)Once BY-pass to hotwater tank is switched over, then I go to each hot water facuet until The water comes through pink. Do toilets, showers even outside shower if you have one on unit. I use about 1 to 2 gallons of RV antifreeze a season(ABOUT $10.00 worth to insure no frozen water lines, a small price to pay) I always allow enough antifreeze to come out of facuets to make sure the traps in drains are filled with antifreeze to cover them as well. Whole project to winterize your unit will take under 15min.!!! Its very easy for most to do and you will know its done fully by doing it yourself. 
Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. I purchased this to be able to attach a high-end hydraulic assisted bike rake on the back of my Jeeps (JKs) with the rear tire still on.  It fit perfectly and teamed with the Bolt Lock BLT7018448 5/8'' Receiver Lock (Keyed specifically for your line of vehicle) it can be kept in the Jeep and my daughter doesn't need anything but her car key.The extender is exactly as advertised, well made, fit perfectly and does eactly what it is inteded for. Exactly what was offered, fit nicely, no major prep work, won't fade or crack, adjusts perfectly, easy removal and fits under seat in truck 
Fits perfectly for my 2003 Toyota Camry, but the number of folds in the filter were fewer than the OEM one. It's short 10 folds compared to the Toyota OEM cabin air filter. Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlander Perfect fit for rear window on my 2004 Ford Excursion Limited. Easy to install. No spotting seen or squeaking at all 
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these.

Looks to be of nice quality.  Torque to 25ft/lbs (on the Frontier anyway) This is one-size-fits-most. It works on the filter for my 2002 Volkswagen Passat, but it's too large to grip the filter on my 1993 Chevrolet S10. 
bought this for my 2004 honda crv.  fit perfectly and cleared the code.  easy to do just give the threads some wd40 It fits perfectly to my 2005 Honda Accord.Filter quality seems to be good. Fit perfectly on my 2012 Honda Civic Si. Way better than spending the premium for Honda to do it, takes like 1 minute.

PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars 
I bought this steering wheel cover to hide the peeling leather on my 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited steering wheel. I measured the inside dimensions of the wheel, 15". I did not have to heat or stretch the new wheel cover, it fit perfectly and looks great. It's also much easier to keep clean with interior protectant. They only fit around a standard thickness roll bar not the newer jeep arrangement with the plastic cover shroud of the late models. ...fits my 1973 Chevy/GMC 4x4 steering wheel perfect. Stretch it over the wheel and wrap the vinyl string around it nice and tight. The vinyl will break so just stretch it a little. 
The 2 x 2 Inch mirrors are a good fit for 2006 Honda Pilot. I had to order via Amazon since I couldn't find these anywhere - it appears local auto stores only carry the 3 x 3 inch size. These little blind spot mirrors are a must buy item - they cover the blind spots on either side of the vehicle very well. would recommend getting a  size  smaller than  what the  &#34;sizing chart&#34; recommends  as  I  measure aroun my leg  as  recommended  and  the chaps  were  one size too large.. otherwise they are  awesome  quality and build Sizes listed in reviews and the two in the description (15.8 x 10.5 x 5, and 12.5 x 9.5 x 7) don't match to what I received...The bag I received is in between what has been listed in the descriptions:  13.5" x 9" x 6" (empty).While seemingly a good quality bag, with a fair amount of straps and attached rain-cover (hidden in the heel of the bag), it seems the manufacturer (or seller) has no idea how to use a measuring tape!The bag itself is quite nice... good padding, rubberized bottom to prevent sliding, small pockets on either side, and zippers seem of reasonable quality.For the price and bag quality, I'm not complaining.  It works great on my CB750, and it does fit on the pillion of my VT1100c2 (without having to remove my rider backrest)  So if you have standard seating (or a touring/adventure style), this bag will do well for you as a pillion bag, and with a little strap adjustments, it also fits vertical on the front or back of a sissy-bar, or horizontal on a larger luggage rack... 
My Miata actually takes the HP-1008 which is slightly shorter in length. I prefer this one because it is the same spec's with more capaciaty and I can use a standard wrench instead of a filter wrench inside the tight engine bay. I've been using K&N filters on my Honda cars and Miata for years. Top quality and Amazon gives me the best price. Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars I use this exact filter on my 05 Honda Silver Wing. Honda recomends Torqing the filter. And the 17mm Nut makes it easy. Bought the bike used with about 2k miles. Rode 1500 miles and my oil is still clean. This is a Heavy filter for its size. Due to the steel case. 
This sunshade is easy to use and folds up to a nice compact size that fits under my seat well. It's a quite large size so is made for an SUV or car that has a large windshield like my Toyota Prius. While it doesn't fit the Prius perfectly, it's the closest size to being perfect.At this price, I have no complaints with this and can recommend it. This is one-size-fits-most. It works on the filter for my 2002 Volkswagen Passat, but it's too large to grip the filter on my 1993 Chevrolet S10. It doesnt fit the Home Depot bucket...sits a few inches off the bottom. I dont think I can blame the seller for this as they dont control the size of HD buckets. Its really not a big deal as its snug &#34;almost&#34; to the bottom. Havent tried the Lowes one. 
I use this on my dark grey Ford Explorer because the Ohio license plates are white. This looks very nice on the dark vehicle and I have  not experienced any troubles with law enforcement in the state of Ohio for the shield being too dark. Fit my '98 Nissan Frontier's oil pan perfectly. Looks to be of nice quality.  Torque to 25ft/lbs (on the Frontier anyway) Very nice sturdy chock with a convenient synthetic leash.  Looks just like the one pictured.  I purchased two.  The price is for one each.  The size is just right for compact vehicles such as a Ford Ranger or other small Truck or Car with Stock Tires. 
I love this unit. Now I know in detail what's wrong with my car before I take it to the shop. This lessens the opportunity that the shop will try to upsell me on a service that I may not need. I also like the idea of being able to log the issues on my computer. I have used it on a 1993 Ford F150; 2001 Nissan Sentra; 3007 Lexus RX350 and a 2001 Cadi Deville When I ordered this, I was guaranteed fitment on a Toyota 3S-FE engine. When it arrived, it was not the correct size. i left two stars because I did run out and buy the correct size from another store, however, I didnt want to have to do this when I had all the rest of my parts shipped in. These did not fit my '08 suburban, the description said w/ 9x3 hook, so I assumed that to be included. It wasn't and I was unable to use these on my '08 suburban. 
This is put together well. Not sure why I would need it but just in case I want to run an inverter off of a 12 vdc battery then I can Its what the owners manual for a 2012 acura mdx required, and i needed it just in case when i am up in the mountains, i need to chain up...never used it yet...but good to know i have it ready to go if needed. I haven't used them yet but they look good and it will do what I need. I need to wash my car I guess 
Worked well for adjusting valves on my Honda Accord.  Price was right and they had all the standard sizes which are close enough to the metric 32mm is the correct size for my Jetta TDI oil cap, and this fits perfectly.It's also fairly low profile, another plus. This sunshade is easy to use and folds up to a nice compact size that fits under my seat well. It's a quite large size so is made for an SUV or car that has a large windshield like my Toyota Prius. While it doesn't fit the Prius perfectly, it's the closest size to being perfect.At this price, I have no complaints with this and can recommend it. 
Need one say more?  And, these can be locked in place using a small lock you put in the tightening head (lock not included).  Once in place between the wheels on a tandem axle trailer, there's no way the trailer will move.  Cool! I bought a pair of these for my 2002 Grand Cherokee. It took a grand total of 5 minutes to install both of them, and half of that was spent looking for a screwdriver.If you are at all nervous about trying this, here is a overly detailed set of instructions.1. Open hood. Prop it open with something wooden so it doesn't fall on you.2. Identify the strut on the right side of the hood.3. Identify the small metal clip at both ends of the strut. If in doubt, look at the new ones. You are looking for a metal band, about 1/2 inch in width, with two small slots. On the vehicle, slide a small screwdriver blade into the clip's slots, and twist the screwdriver to pry the clip upward. You can remove it, or just loosen it enough that there is a good sized gap between the clip and the strut.4. Now pull the strut away from the hood/body. You may need to slide a screwdriver behind the strut arm to get a little bit of leverage. It is easier to start with the end attached to the hood.5. Remove both ends of the strut from the vehicle.6. Attach the new strut. Make sure the strut is aligned the same way as the old one-with the cylinder at the top of the strut. (Refer to the opposite strut). Just place the socket in the strut over the ball joint on the vehicle, and give it a little tap or squeeze with your hand. It should snap right on.7. Repeat on the other strut.Note- if it seems like the strut is too big, the hood is probably not open all the way. There is NO WAY you are strong enough to compress the strut by hand.I'd strongly recommend replacing them in pairs, otherwise you will get a twisting motion on your hood. Plus if one failed, the other one is close behind.That's it, you're done. This little gadget keeps my lift handle paired up nicely when mounted to my vehicle. It can get in the way when jacking, but it is easily solved by just pulling it up onto the d hook on the top. 
Fits my low clearance Mazda 5 that comes with alloy wheels and 3/4 inches of clearance between the inside of the tire and the suspension.  Have not tried it in the snow yet. Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend. Its a tire gauge that is pretty basic to use. You insert the metal pin into the tire tread gap and the rear part tells you the depth. Walk around the vehicle and check all the tires. If the front tires are worn more than the rear, its time to rotate the front tires to the rear. 
I ordered two sets of these for my ranger crew.  I just ordered a third set  They are built well and do their job.  When you pull really hard on them it feels like it may break (I am a big guy) but no breakage and has helped distribute weight on several occasions that could have been very dicey and great to hold onto.  Highly recommend and the price is great!  They come in pairs! These Hopkins "Graduated Levels" come two to pack and are exactly what we needed for our new "pop-up" camper. These can be installed using the included double-stick tape or, more permanently, using the two pre-drilled screw holes (screws not included). We opted for the double-stick tape option since I really didn't want to put holes in my camper walls.These levels are easy to read from a distance and are very accurate.Highly Recommended!CFH these are great! i love that it has the string to remove. I only bought on set and ended up buying a differ set for the other side of my trailer and these work much better then my other set. i am going to buy another set of these. 
Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. Works great, nice to have a second cable, but the OBD end of the cable is angled.  In my case, this cable won't work on my Subaru Outback.  I would prefer the option of a straight OBD connector.  Note that the angle connector works on my other four cars (Mazda, Honda, Dodge). I purchased this to be able to attach a high-end hydraulic assisted bike rake on the back of my Jeeps (JKs) with the rear tire still on.  It fit perfectly and teamed with the Bolt Lock BLT7018448 5/8'' Receiver Lock (Keyed specifically for your line of vehicle) it can be kept in the Jeep and my daughter doesn't need anything but her car key.The extender is exactly as advertised, well made, fit perfectly and does eactly what it is inteded for. 
Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend. Nice fit, need after market aluminum hood latch from rugged ridge to eliminate hood shimmer from wind at high speeds (highway) Your Hi Lift jack will not work well for you if you are off-road.  Sand = Nope. Mud = Nope.  Must have a wide base to make the jack work correctly. (I know from experience - ugh) 
Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlander Inexpensive, yet works as good as the ones sold by Honda dealerships. Made true to specs and fits right into the slot on my Accord 2006.Will buy again. Fit perfectly on my 2012 Honda Civic Si. Way better than spending the premium for Honda to do it, takes like 1 minute. 
You cant find these oil  filters any were, Not Autozone, not Pepboys. not Napa,  I found them here on Amazon for $3.00 a piece so I bought 8 of them. Now I dont have to waist my time looking all over town for them, I have my own supply of them!!! I was a touch skeptical. But I can afford to throw it out if I don't like it.  Well I can say, I will NOT be throwing this out!  I was so impressed with how my cars looked when I was done that I had to ask my self. Why didn't I buy this sooner. And it is true. A little goes a long way. I don't have the time to write down all of the uses that this product can handle.  I know that it works for what I want it to do.  The down side is that it take 24 hours to fully cure.  Get some!  You will love it.  This price was cheaper than I could buy it locally at the Ace Hwr store 
There are 2 part numbers out there for this product.... I have 15&#34; wheels on my 5th wheel so I ordered the larger one... I tried this out just for fit and I think this will work perfectly to secure wheels when one side is up on leveling blocks and can't be chocked. Fits a little tight especially around the front fender and floorboards but it works.  I have a 03' Shadow ACE 750cc.  After a couple rain storms I can report my bike stayed dry (except a portion of the front wheel) and through heavy winds, the motorcycle cover stayed put.  What&#8217;s nice about this cover is the price and how it has elastic hooks to secure the cover in place.  If you decide to buy a cover and your bike has a windshield, floor boards and aftermarket mirrors I recommend you buy a 2XL (if your bike is similar in size to a Shadow 750cc).  Look at the picture I posted, mine has stock mirrors and no windshield and fits VERY tight.  My mirrors shift out of place when the cover is on.  Before each ride I have to adjust them cause the cover is soo tight.  Also, if you have floor boards that&#8217;ll make the fit even more tighter.  Buying one size bigger and I would say you bike will be 100% covered. I have a 30' travel trailer.  It has built in jacks at the front and rear (4 total) along with the tongue jack but it still tends to bounce no matter how tight you get those jacks.Not a major problem, but a minor annoyanceSo I ordered these.  My camper has twin axles and the axles are square.  I put these under one of the axles and crank them up as tight as I can.  It removes 99% of the bounce in the camper.I recommend these to anyone that wants to use them for this purpose.  I suppose you could also use them at the front and back, if you don't have built in jacks. 
Need 2 for each side, works well for small pop up. Buy these over ones w/ rope and add your own rope, same choke. These already have the hole for rope. Dimensions given are inaccurate on these two, they are exactly the same size. Works just like the originals. Infiniti g37s came with ones that are nearly identical but these were a better value. A good Made in USA chock.  It may cost about a buck less each at Walmart, if you can find it.There is a hole in the side for a rope to hold one or two together for each side of the tire.  Don't buy the one with a rope. It costs twice as much for the same one chock, NOT two.The heavy rubber  Buyers Rubber Wheel Chock - 5in.W, Model# WC1467A  at $8.99 each at Northern Tools are heavier and provides a better grip on concrete, but they are heavy to carry around.  I use the Buyers' ones in the garage and carry the Camco ones in my trunk.Also NOTE that the Buyer's ones are made in the same place as the expensive Race Ramps Branded ones costing 50% more.  The Buyers ones are nearly identical, are exactly the same size and weight.  The Race Ramps ones have shallow slits cut into the bottom. 
I keep my PUP in the garage - this dock assures my camper does not come rolling out of the garage.  Between this and some 2x4 on the tires, my PUP is not going anywhere.While camping, this dock helps out a great deal when the soil is soft or sandy; it helps distribute the hitch dolly wheel load more evenly. This helps to keep things in my RV frisge from shifting while we are motering down the road.  It sets up with ease. Holds my boat trailer perfectly still as its designed to do.  Makes hooking my boat trailer onto my truck a little more difficult when doing it solo (which is usually the case) as there's no movement when attempting to lower it over the ball hitch. 
I mounted this as an auxiliary transmission cooler in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 with the 4.0.  No issues.  Obviously, this was a custom installation.  But with a little research on the jeep forums, no problem. Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend. I use this on the back window of my Jeep Grand Cherokee. It does not flex enough to have full contact on the window. It only has about 8&#34; of contact. I will not purchase this again. 
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend. 
Great product to lift my Nissan Versa another 6 inches to get underneath.  They do the job, but the construction is alittle liteweight(some sort of hollow structured plastic/polycarbonate).  Recommended only for light compact cars with narrow tires.  Would recommend the Rhino Ramp 12000 if they were less expensive than $59.00, maybe more like $39.00. Excellent wiper blades, easy to install, and perfect size match for a 2009 Altima Hybrid.  The car requires a bracket-less blade to look right and the Bosch look better then the original factory wipers.  Not much else to say here..but they are GREAT thus far. GREAT PRICE AND DELIVERY.  (1) HOUR TO INSTALL AND LOOK BETTER THAN FACTORY.  THESE ARE NECESSARY FOR STATE LAW WHEN YOU RUN THOSE LARGER TIRES.  REALLY SET THE JEEP OFF.  A+ 
Exact fit for my 2005 SV650.The instructions were clear - but probably because I watched the other reviewer's video on how to add the battery fluid. No problems encountered on my install. Installed this this spring on my first outing and I have not been disapointed.Read the instructions carefully and installation should be a breeze. I think I would have expected better instructions for a USA made product. However, there is a lot of available information on the internet and at other vendor websites, so the installation is very straightforward, simple even. I like the small profile and display options. You would also think that technology today would burn in the settings so that you do not need to keep the unit energized continuously. I do not drive my truck for weeks and I will not leave something that draws milliamps connected so I have to disconnect this when not in use. That was not clear in anything I read about it. 
I like this flexible funnel over others for two reasons:1) Length is excellent and makes it easy to access the filler hole.2) Bottom stopper lets me hang the item for storage without having to worry about excess fluid leaking everywhere.Unlike other funnels, you can't simply stick this in the hole and have it stand on its own due to the flexible tube. However, it does have a small hole in a plastic tab sticking out of the side of the rim which is perfect for threading a small hook or wire through and attaching it to the underside of the hood. All the benefits of a regular funnel with added flexibility and length - perfect. This plate holder is great. It has many wide cutouts to adjust plate position almost infinitely. Used zipties to hold it through the grill of my car to avoid drilling into the bumper and it holds pretty well. The pin (10mm) is too wide for the disc brake holes and the disk is too wide for the lock to easily slip on and off without damaging the dick bake itself. Great lock for other bikes I suspect, but not designed for thick brake disks with smaller holes. 
These are the perfect size for the tires on an rv trailer - 15&#34;. I had some that were too large and didn't fit the curve of the tire so weren't very effective. These fit perfectly and hold extremely well. If you put a loop of rope through the hole, it makes it easier to remove them from under your tires. I purchased this to secure my motorcycle.  I use it on my 1976 FXE Harley's front rotor.  It works well and secures the front with the lock and visible indication to hopefully make the thief move on to another bike.  The only problem I had with it was I wanted to put it on my rear wheel because that makes it much harder for a thief to take the bike.  My rotor's holes are too small for the pin to fit and the throat barely fit due to my rotor's thickness.  It does however fit well on my front rotor.Bottom line, this is a good, low cost solution to add as one additional layer of theft protection for your motorcycle. This works exactly as you expect. If your gap is too small, you can just slightly tilt the entire gauge while measuring the gap, and the gap will extend some... that is, measure, push to extend, re-measure, and repeat until you have the right gap.You can also use the inside of the small ring area to expand the gap. This is where I think the tool could improve. The small edge of the wedge on the inner ring could be smaller. Once, I happened to tap my gap too small to fit on that wedge, and had some trouble getting the gap to open back up enough to again work on the gauge.All in all, though, this is a necessity in my motorcycle tool bag. 
I presently use this in a 2007 Dodge Nitro SXT (56,000 miles) and a 2005 Yamaha Royal Star motorcycle (shaft drive, 88,000 miles) which are both frequently operated far from population centers. I've also used this in my previous Dakota pickup truck and my Mustang hardtop, total mileage on all vehicles in excess of 500,000 miles (206,000 on the Mustang, 166,000 on the Dakota) and no problems experienced with any of them. I consider it cheap "insurance" for vehicles I depend upon to get me wherever I need to be. I originally purchased this to use in conjunction with myEquus 3721 Battery and Charging System Monitorbecause I wanted to get an accurate reading of my car battery's voltage. Using that device plugged directly in the the lighter port was not accurate because my car's electrical system is all powered up along with the lighter port.I also use this adapter now when using my car vac (with engine running) as well. It can also be used with powerful air compressors that would normally blow the lighter fuse in your car as this enables you to plug those directly to the battery, bypassing the car's fuses. The installation of the SG2 is simple: attach the OBD2 connector to the DLC port and attach the RJ-45 jack to the SG2 unit. Routing the cable is really up to the operator. I chose to do it in a crude manner because I don't plan to make it a permanent addition to the car. I zip tied the cable to my HVAC vents and anchored it to the empty traction control hole behind the glove box.I used 1 of the provided velcro kits to affix the SG2 to the top of my steering column so that it is right below the instrument panel. It actually blocks my view of the shift indicator array, although I can still see it clearly if I lean forward.The update rate set at FAST is still rather slow and that is to be expected with the outdated OBD-II network. The "fastest" aftermarket scan tool that I have seen is SCT's Live Link for Ford / GM / Chryslers. If you want anything faster, you are going to have to borrow an OEM's scan tool system.The X-Gauge interface is a bit cumbersome since you are restricted to using 2 buttons to enter alphanumeric characters while if you pause for anything more than 10-15 seconds, the SG2 shuts down. According to Linear Logic, they are working on an updated SG2 with datalogging features so hopefully they incorporate a PC interface to speed up programming and setup times.I have it set to monitor instantaneous MPG, RPM, Vehicle Speed, and a gauge that I frequently switch depending on my mood. I am monitoring the torque converter slip ratio. Whenever it reads below 1.00, it means the torque converter is "slipping". Above 1.00 means the output side of the converter is spinning faster than the input side and theoretically it could just mean engine braking with some torque converter slip. You can program custom X-Gauges to monitor gross engine horsepower or torque input at the transmission.I had previously used a Garmin Forerunner 101 to check my GPS vehicle speed and compared it to my speedometer readout (2000 Ford Crown Vic with mechanical speedometer). It revealed that my GPS speed was about 2-3 mph slower than the speedometer indicated speed. The SG2's vehicle speed readout (from the Vehicle Speed Sensor PID in the OBD-2 system) is approximately 2-3 mph slower than the speedometer reading and I am assuming this is the same readout as my GPS (I didn't get a chance to verify this yet).Some of the gauges I like to monitor are Coolant Temperature, Intake Air Temperature, Transmission Fluid Temperature (XGauge), Torque Converter Slip Ratio (XGauge), Gross Horsepower (XGauge), RPM, Vehicle Speed, and MPG.I still haven't been able to figure out how to work the trip computer properly to display averaged fuel economy. The instantaneous MPG is more important to me because I want to see if anything is not working right on long cruises. I have often wondered if the torque converter was locking properly when I use cruise control or when cruising on the highway.The data collection stability is impressive. I never ran into many problems with Car Code or SCT's Live Link, but SG2 is just more convenient and compact. The backlight colors are interesting as they allow you to choose 4 different values of each RGB component (or 64 possible combinations). I have it set to R=3, B=0, G=0 so that it resembles Pontiac's interior lighting (I drive a Ford).My only real complaint is that there's not a better way of attaching the SG2 to the car. A suction cup mount for the windshield would come in handy since I could mount it near my line of sight without relying on adhesive-backed velcro. The interface is quite intuitive but I would have liked a way to program the X-gauge more easily, like via a PC interface.Bottom line: The SG2 is a great deal if you are interested in data readouts for your car. There are cheaper ways of pulling DTC codes, so the only real usefulness of SG2 is the "realtime" PID monitoring and the trip computer for cars that do not have such devices. If you know someone who is a bona fide gearhead and drives a car made in 1996 or newer, they may appreciate the SG2 as a gift.UPDATE:While the ScanGauge II provided a useful feature for cars without trip computers or onboard monitoring for various PIDs, I have noticed that it began to malfunction more frequently. The gauge readouts began to "flicker" between PIDs. For example, monitoring IGNition, the IGN began to switch rapidly between HPR. Just recently, the entire ScanGauge II shutdown while I was driving. It would refuse to reconnect with the OBD2 network. When it did find a connection, a lot of the text was garbled and it lost all of my trip data except for the total mileage. My car normally maxes out on 300 miles per tank of gasoline, so I was bewildered when the SG2 said I drove over 4000 miles. Other SG2 readers have reported similar quirks, albeit not as serious as the self shutdown and data corruption that I experienced.Many newer cars already have features built-into the car. The Pontiac G8, and Nissan GT-R are two examples of cars that have very developed "trip computers" while many other modern vehicles like the Pontiac G6, have trip computers that can monitor most of the fuel-related data. 
Works as needed, only problem is it will only fit a standard oil jug not the gallon. Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. a regular 32mm socket will not fit in the space of my equinox. this is a kind of shorter 32mm socket designed only for oil filter cap job. it works fine. 
This product fits like it should and would look really nice if it had been shipped properly!  I got it and the box was all crunched.  The item had no cushioning around it and the front is bent in.  Need to return for a replacement!  It would have been 5 stars if the front had not been bent in and it was packed properly!  Fits right over my 3 burner RV stove and rest on the counter top.  I will be adding rubber feet so that it will scratch the sides of my stove nor my counter top!  To secure it you have to screw it to the counter top.  The back has a hing with 5 screw holes in it where you can secure it or it will stay put without screwing it down.  It came with 5 long screws.  Not sure if i want to secure mine yet.  I have a new RV and not sure i want to put screw holes in the knife holder behind the stove! The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around! Simple! You must do accurate measurements so you don't damage walls or doors in tight and close spaces. Put the vehicle in the parking spot, line up the parking mats next to the tires, mark the PRECISE location of each mat in relation to the tires, back out the vehicle, slide the mats into former tire location, DONE! Now, roll the vehicle back into place. SIMPLE! 
Works as intended, easy to plug in and charge the motorcycle batteries.I double checked with volt meter at the end of charging and was at proper voltage Nice high amp (current) rating on this. I epoxy it to a 12ah  12 volt gel battery and I can use it as a jumpstarter oremergency power supply for camping or power outages. After a power outage, I connected my refrigerator to this power supply. Sadly, its inverter was unable to support my refrigerator. The Duracell DPP-600HD doesn't have enough momentary  output to handle the initial start-up current spike of a refrigerator's compressor motor. The specifications say it can momentarily provide up to 960 watts. This equates to 8 amps at 120v.  Yet, public benchmark figures for a home refrigerator's start-up current indicate 13 amps for up to 1/2 second. Other appliances that use electric motors such as sump pumps are likely to exhibit the same characteristics. My suggestion is that customers immediately test this product with any device they intend to power during an outage.Some important specifications are missing in the Amazon listing.  One of the key statics is the capacity of the internal battery, which is 28 amp-hours at 12 v.  This equates to 336 watt hours.  Yet, AC output is much lower than this presumably due to inverter losses.  These losses increase with power output.  The following table illustrates this.  The last column is my calculation.load.................watts....hours....watt-hoursCordless telephone.....5........35.0 ...175Portable stereo.........10........22.0 ...220Laptop computer.......20........7.0 ....140Fan.......................100.........1.7....17036" TV...................133........1.2 ....1603/8 drill.................300........0.4 ....115Warm-air fan heater.312........0.4 ....109Blender..................385........0.3 ....109HID Floodlights.......400........0.3.....107Observe that the total energy delivered (watt-hour) drops with power consumption.  Ultimately, the usable energy is significantly less than what is contained within the lead acid battery.For reference, a refrigerator will use about 200 watts of electricity when the compressor is running. Typical consumers will have their refrigerator running about 50% to 60% of the time, which equates to an average of 100-120 watts being consumed continuously.ConsDoesn't handle current spikes associated with certain electric motorsProsBoth AC and DC outputPortableSimple operation 
My son suggested I get the whole K&N system but I opted for the factory style replacement filter instead. O.K., I am cheap...lol.  I installed this in my 2010 f150 5.4 litre FX2. I keep the avg.mpg readout on in my dash. I average 17.4 and I don't drive it hard. After the filter, I average 18.1. I was shocked and I am very pleased with these results. I got this when I read the reviews about the lighter outlet blowing fuses. I don't like the clamp quality but they are ok, I can fix anything so if they go bad I will just replace them with better quailty GLAD  I  WENT  WITH  THE  CHROME AND  NOT  THE BLACK ONE, I  HOOKED  THIS ONE UP TO  MY GV1400 MOTORCYCLE IF  YOU  HAVE JUST  A  LITTLE  KNOW  HOW YOU CAN  DO  IT YOUR SELF , ALL  YOU WILL NEED TO GO WITH THIS IS A RELAY THAT DOES NOT COME WITH IT. YOU  CAN  GET IT ON HERE OR ANY PART STORE, I  HAVE MADE MANY PEOPLE JUMP  DUE  TO THE SOUND OF  THE  HORNS  LOUDNESS. 
Excellent adapter, I'm using it in my solar system, I use it to connect the battery to the charge controller, and as additional value has an integrated fuse holder which prevents any damage to the system, very well designed and built! This is a must have tool for people who work on their own cars.  It seems the oxygen sensor is one of the more common failures that cause check engine codes to appear on the OBDII (engine and emissions control) computer system. Fantastic price for a very handy tool in the garage!  When working on automotive and motorcycle accessories one needs to &#34;power them up&#34; to test them or their function and this power source provides the juice required.  You can also use auto accessories having the standard cord and cigarette lighter plug, e.g. CB radio, car vac, inflator, etc.  I use mine for testing lighting and accessories I install. 
This blade works great however you need to know a few things.  The ice will destroy it over time if you try and run this + windshield washer fluid in the winter on an uncleared windshield.  If you at using this in the rain/show though it will work great.  Another thing is that you can't use rain-x with this it will cause smearing. I haven't really used it yet for the reason intended, changing the oil in my jet ski.  So, I can't comment on how well it works.  The main reason for this review is to put it out there that it does not work with a 2000 Chevy Silverado.  The siphon tube does not fit thru the bottom of the dip stick tube.  It would be really nice if Mityvac had a published list of what vehicles it works with and what ones it does not.  I have my fingers crossed that it'll work with my jet ski, otherwise there will be a new/(un)used Mityvac on *****'slist.  Long story short, do your research to see if you can confirm or deny if it will work with your vehicle before you buy it. Makes seal very slick and shiney should do a great job protecting the rubber seals, dont know how long it will last untill it has to be reapplied, but will let you know 
Easy to install. I used my own screws because of the material that I was mounting the bracket on. I had to tape one of the light adapter plugs as it was a loose fit in the bracket. I have used these every time I replace my old plugs. I tried a different brand ONCE and it was a big mistake. This brand is specifically what the owners manual and shop manual state you need to use. For $2 a plug, Amazon is by far the cheapest place to get them. Packaging is the usual. Gap part of the plug is wrapped with a TP roll tube from a mouses house, then plugs placed individually in a tiny cardboard box, then the plugs placed in a bigger box lined with air bags. First I want to say, the UPC tag marks this size as "small".If your wanting to store the Battery Tender Plus in this nice looking bag,I strongly suggest on ordering the Battery Tender Carrying Pouch - Large 500Large-0140.That case will hold all that comes with the Battery Tender Plusand additionally will hold the Battery Tender 25 ft extension cable with ease.The Battery Tender Plus and all the cables will fit inside this small size, 6" x 7 1/4" x 2" bag,but only a certain way, with ease and only before the cables are used.After you wrap the cables back-up, it's much harder to get everything in this bag.Lay the Tender to the right rear Conner of the bag,and it's two attached cords in front of the Tender.Lay both styles of battery clips on the left side to the rear, and the pouch can be easily closed.The inter pocket is perfect for the instruction/warranty papers.The package the Battery Tender Plus comes in is a pop-apart ~ re-usable packageand is just as good for storing the Battery Tender in, for a few yrs,and I often use pop-apart packaging on various items for permanent storage.But I know that after 4 to 5 yrs that this plastic disintegrates.Also, this Battery Tender plastic package takes up 2 ~3 times the space that the utility bag does.So this time I opted for an accessory, it's just plain fun !Footnote: After ordering and receiving this small size,I realized the difficulties to pack all the items that come with the Battery Tender Plus in this bag.I had also decided I wanted to order a Battery Tender 25 ft. extension cable.So I decided to also order the large size bag so I could hold all the original stuff, plus the extension.I've since received that order, and the large size is the one to get for ample room. 
Havent had the need for it just yet,but took it out of the package to look at.I really dont think this will fit my needs in preventing ice & snow on the winshield.Not flexible enough to lay flat against the winshield.Might work ok as a sun shade inside though. I love it. Can also use to leave vehicle outside so the BatteryMinder ( Tender ) stays dry in the garage, if it rains outside. A must have for me. I want to protect this wonderful charger and keep it on the shelf, not under the hood in a hot engine bay. Summer heat car cool get for car it be good make A/C work better no more sad hot dash or hot wheel yay. 
I bought this steering wheel cover to hide the peeling leather on my 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited steering wheel. I measured the inside dimensions of the wheel, 15". I did not have to heat or stretch the new wheel cover, it fit perfectly and looks great. It's also much easier to keep clean with interior protectant. They only fit around a standard thickness roll bar not the newer jeep arrangement with the plastic cover shroud of the late models. Could a wheel chock chock is a wheel chock could chock wheels?In this case: 2.Good build quality, worked well on my AG tires on the rear of the tractor. 
Red line diff  oil for my 02 C5 Z06!!!other than all diff oils smelling bad, great oil and will put my Z06 to the limit w/o worring about diff. Mobil 1 V-Twin 20W-50I was skeptical about using this oil in my Ducati 696 at first, because the manual had specified 15W-50 and many other riders wanted me to use a 10W-40 instead. Many of them claimed that the 20W-50 was designed for slow revving Harley-Davidsons with true V-Twins instead of the somewhat higher revving L-Twins from Ducati.I had clutch slippage with Rotella T6 5W-40, so I tried the M1 V-Twin 20W-50 because it is the only over the counter synthetic xW-50 JASO MA-compliant oil I can find outside the realm of boutique Motorcycle-specific oils from Motul or Silkolene at nearly double the price.The V-Twin 20W-50 is fairly thick out of the bottle, and my 696's engine starts up with a slow lumbering attitude and sound. I contacted Mobil to make sure they would recommend it, and they stated that the V-Twin 20W-50 was the correct oil to use in my 696. Once on the road, I didn't hear/feel anything wrong. WOT 9000 RPM upshifts were clean and precise. The datalogs I got from my Ducati Data Acquisition did not show any RPM spikes, and I did not hear the cat-like screeches after an upshift.As for the high-revving engine comment earlier, I looked up Buell's 1125 and Aprilia's RSV4 engine oil requirements. They both called for 15W-50, and Amsoil's catalog showed recommendations for 20W-50. The 1125 and RSV4 are by no means low revving engines, they can rev higher than most of Ducati's engines which are already fairly high at 9k-11k RPM.Overall: 5/5 stars, great oil to use if your bike needs 15W-50. Red line ATF/ MTF for my 02 C5 Z06!!!now I can push my z06 knowing my tranny is good to go! 
32mm is the correct size for my Jetta TDI oil cap, and this fits perfectly.It's also fairly low profile, another plus. Sizes listed in reviews and the two in the description (15.8 x 10.5 x 5, and 12.5 x 9.5 x 7) don't match to what I received...The bag I received is in between what has been listed in the descriptions:  13.5" x 9" x 6" (empty).While seemingly a good quality bag, with a fair amount of straps and attached rain-cover (hidden in the heel of the bag), it seems the manufacturer (or seller) has no idea how to use a measuring tape!The bag itself is quite nice... good padding, rubberized bottom to prevent sliding, small pockets on either side, and zippers seem of reasonable quality.For the price and bag quality, I'm not complaining.  It works great on my CB750, and it does fit on the pillion of my VT1100c2 (without having to remove my rider backrest)  So if you have standard seating (or a touring/adventure style), this bag will do well for you as a pillion bag, and with a little strap adjustments, it also fits vertical on the front or back of a sissy-bar, or horizontal on a larger luggage rack... This is one-size-fits-most. It works on the filter for my 2002 Volkswagen Passat, but it's too large to grip the filter on my 1993 Chevrolet S10. 
Does a super job on brass, copper, silver, aluminum, bronze and stainless steel. Polishes most metals to a mirror-like finish. Very similar to Flitz polishing cream. The Quik Interior Detailer is a great product from Meguiars. This provides the finish I like on my interior (not too glossy, but a nice clean matte finish).This interior detailer spray also has a nice smell to it. Safe for all surfaces (vinyl, leather, plastic, chrome, navigation/entertainment consoles and LCD screens). This is a high quality plastic & the smoke tint looks great against my truck which is black.  Definitely worth the $5+-. 
this actually works!!! the musty moldy a/c smell is entirely gone.  also the outside smell like bad exhaust gas smells less.. Seems to be a good product but does not remove all the odors associated with the water. It wasn't advertised to take out all the odor,just greatly reduce them.  We had some odors from water in a local campground. No taste issues so I think that was o.k and the odor wasn't all that bad but don't think it will take out all odors competely. Works great and has a pleasant citrus smell. But man does the mist burn your eyes. Made my interior look new and dried to a natural low shine. Did not attract dust or stay wet like other products. I will be buying more of this. 
I bought this cable chain for my 2005 Honda Odyssey with tire size 265/65R16 in 2008 and have been using every winter.  Practice once before you have to do it under snowy conditions.  I found out the hard way that it's difficult to put even the easy to put chains, if you haven't read the instructions.  I can get the chain on now in under 5 minutes on both the tires.  Slide the chain under the tire and hook up the bottom (split end), then proceed to do the top inside and outside, followed by the rubber tensioner and you are good to go.  Reverse the install and the chain will be off in a couple of minutes!  Before I got this chain, I used to struggle with the chains that require you to lay it down straight, drive over (with someone helping) and make the connections. The whole thing is made of plastic, so if you over tighten even the tiniest bit, you strip the plastic threads and you end with with a handful of plastic pieces that can no longer be secured to the hood of your car.It's a very fine balance between loose, snug, and too tight with this kit.  I was screwing the star nut by hand to tighten down the nozzle to the hood. I could feel the nut just getting a bit snug when all of a sudden the little resistance I was feeling went to nothing and then I realized that the plastic threads in the plastic screw had stripped out of the plastic nut.  So the left wiper nozzle now freely moves around the hood of my car despite trying to glue it down and use electrical tape to keep it one spot.  Very annoying since I barely put any significant amount of pressure on the nut. These are good enough for visual rough-leveling of your camper, but they're no precion instrument.  It's tough to install these while holding them level and then sticking them down with the double-sided foam tape on the back side.  Once it's down it's down.  If you stick it on crooked, rip it off and throw it away and start over, or try to twist them level and then put in some screws to hold it there.  The foam tape will allow you to twist them back and forth. 
...fits my 1973 Chevy/GMC 4x4 steering wheel perfect. Stretch it over the wheel and wrap the vinyl string around it nice and tight. The vinyl will break so just stretch it a little. match my existing wheel chocks.  A little too big a radius on the curved side for my wheels, otherwise would be a 5-star. Like others I have found the cover to fall short in the sizing department. I understand it's leather and unlike a comparable vinyl based product, sizing is critical because unlike vinyl, leather can't be stretched too much for a fit. This limits you to a steering wheel that is within 5mm of the product's diameter. I have tried fitting this on two steering wheels. First on my F250 and it was literally impossible. The diameter of the cover missed it by inches. Then I tried fitting this on my Saturn Vue. Now this is important, because the Vue is geared towards women whom have small hands, ergo the steering wheel is smaller and skinnier. So you would think the Vue is a perfect candidate...NOPE. I wrestled with the installation and would described it like sparring with a bear. After 10mins (not including breaks) I finally got the thing on the Vue. The result was the leather had stretched so much, it literally developed permanent stretch marks. Also, like other's who have commented in their Feedback, the wrap only made it barely halfway around the grip of the wheel. So there are now two pressure points on my hands from the front and back seams of the wrap when gripping the wheel.I gave it a rating of three due to it's exceptional quality. It is well made in the sense that its leather is very thick and the seams are well stitched. If this was right-size for my application it would have rated it Five.Part of the poor fit was my fault since I didn't pay close enough attention to the specs and prior to ordering I should have measured my steering wheels for proper fit. I mistakenly assumed since I had two steering wheels and one that is especially skinny, that It wouldn't have been a problem fitting.Take proper care with the dimensions of 15 x 1.5  Measure the girth of your steering wheel with a seamstress measuring tape. If 1.5" does not cover at least 70% of you steering wheel circumference and the wheel's diameter is great than 15 inches, you will be immensely disappointed or at the very least frustrated with the install. 
These gauges are light, easy to operate, long-lasting and inexpensive.  They're much better than the pen style gauges that most people use - I have one of these in each of our cars This little item is surprisingly powerful and worth having. It's great for the occasional inflation of any tire from riding mower wheels, trailer wheels, to car tires. It's loud, so what. That just means it's working. The gauge is easy to read, i.e., I'm almost blind and I can read it. For what it does -- INFLATE -- it does better than expected. However, as many have noted, it does have a few design shortcomings. Among them are longer cords, better storage departments, perhaps a wider profile, a metal, not plastic valve connector. But you can see that Black & Decker's primary design goal was for this item to be compact and fit out of the way wherever you store it. After a year's worth of uses in -10F to 102F temperatures, I just wish I had bought it sooner! These are the best wiper blades I have used -- much better than other Rain-X blades. My only complaint is they are ugly. The connector is bulky and the arms are all plastic, making them look cheap. I would give these an extra star if they were lower profile. That being said, I would definitely recommend them. 
Easy to put on, just move it into place and and snap it in.However, it depends on two clips on the bottom that are fairly thin. If you force it instead of maneuvering it into place, those clips with break and it won't stay on. I went through several different shades trying to find one that would fit a large windshield.  The Basic Jumbo shade fits the bill, plus it folds up nicely.  If you have a large truck, van, or other vehicle that has a large windshield, then this product will likely fulfill your needs.  Since this is actually two different pieces, you can place them horizonallty or vertically.  The only downside is that there is no opening for a mirror, but I find that these go over the mirror and are easily held up with the sunvisors.The material is thin, but appears to be very strong.  The shields fold up into a small circle (about 12" across) for storage.  Unfold slightly and they pop out into their full size and shape.  To fold them back, just bend in slightly and turn your wrists.  They bounce right back into the small circles. First perfectly on Toyota GenII Prius which includes model years 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009. The replacement is super easy, taking less than 2 minutes if you know what you are doing. If you have never done it before, save yourself $80 at the dealership and take 5-10 minutes to do it.1) Open the lower glovebox2) Squeeze in on the sides of the glovebox near the top where there are 2 plastic cylinders that keep the glovebox from falling to the ground and lower the glovebox past where the stoppers stop it from going3) Remove the little piston on the right side of the glovebox that slows its decent by moving the ring part to the right and off of its little plastic nub house.4) The glovebox should now completely detach, and you can rest it somewhere where it won't get scratched.5) The white box directly behind the glovebox contains the HVAC blower motor that gives you air circulation in the car as well as the filter. There are two tabs on the left and right sides of the smaller rectangle on top. Squeeze the tabs and pull towards you. This small book sized thing will come out completely. Take this to a garbage pail or outside and remove the cloth filter from inside.6) Replace filter with this one. Make sure to put the flat side on the bottom like the original and position the little tabs over the fabric to hold it loosly in place.7) Replace the white small book with new filter into the slot you removed it from above the blower motor assembly. Note that the white plastic piece you removed has the words &#34;Up&#34; or &#34;Top Side&#34; molded into the plastic. Make sure to install it so that these words are right side up (readable).8) Replace glove box reverse of disassembly9) Enjoy the $80 to $120 you saved versus going to the stealership and know that it was done correctly. 
Hella Replacement.  Kinda.  Mine came with BLUE wire.. they should always be white. Its also not covered in fabric and the white ones are. Great wheel lock that is easy to activate and unlock.  It comes with 3 keys, one of which has a LED light on it.  The product also comes with a reminder cord that attaches to the handle bar as a reminder.  It does just what I was looking for. The material seems durable, but it does not fit tightly on my 30x9.5x15.  There is almost no elastic properties for the interior, and it would easily spin on the tire itself, and stealing it would be ridiculously easy.  The bottom looked like granny panties on a supermodel.  Couldn't see that delightful bottom curve.I used a grommett kit on it so I can thread a rope around it to cinch it tightly.  Has faded to a charcoal gray from black since purchase 18+ months ago. 
Sizes listed in reviews and the two in the description (15.8 x 10.5 x 5, and 12.5 x 9.5 x 7) don't match to what I received...The bag I received is in between what has been listed in the descriptions:  13.5" x 9" x 6" (empty).While seemingly a good quality bag, with a fair amount of straps and attached rain-cover (hidden in the heel of the bag), it seems the manufacturer (or seller) has no idea how to use a measuring tape!The bag itself is quite nice... good padding, rubberized bottom to prevent sliding, small pockets on either side, and zippers seem of reasonable quality.For the price and bag quality, I'm not complaining.

The Tender Jr. does not come with a cigarette adapter so I cut this in half to make two. I purchased 2 lighter plugs for a buck each from China&#8230; with free shipping&#8230; and they are working fine. These aren&#8217;t an exact match with the Tender cables but they fit together OK and are easy to determine polarity with the wire colors. You can also just use this as an extension cord for your Tender. The description states a length of 12-inches&#8230; but it&#8217;s actually 14-inches tip-to-tip on the connectors. Nice item for the price and it&#8217;s made in Mexico. The size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous. The funnel is 10" long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6" long. It states that the funnel is 4" x 4" but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2-1/4" in diameter at the widest point.It would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless. 
Well made Excellent quality.  American made.  Top notch all the way around.  Built to last. Great quality.  American made. 
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Fits perfectly for my 2003 Toyota Camry, but the number of folds in the filter were fewer than the OEM one. It's short 10 folds compared to the Toyota OEM cabin air filter. 
I bought a pair of these for my 2002 Grand Cherokee. It took a grand total of 5 minutes to install both of them, and half of that was spent looking for a screwdriver.If you are at all nervous about trying this, here is a overly detailed set of instructions.1. Open hood. Prop it open with something wooden so it doesn't fall on you.2. Identify the strut on the right side of the hood.3. Identify the small metal clip at both ends of the strut. If in doubt, look at the new ones. You are looking for a metal band, about 1/2 inch in width, with two small slots. On the vehicle, slide a small screwdriver blade into the clip's slots, and twist the screwdriver to pry the clip upward. You can remove it, or just loosen it enough that there is a good sized gap between the clip and the strut.4. Now pull the strut away from the hood/body. You may need to slide a screwdriver behind the strut arm to get a little bit of leverage. It is easier to start with the end attached to the hood.5. Remove both ends of the strut from the vehicle.6. Attach the new strut. Make sure the strut is aligned the same way as the old one-with the cylinder at the top of the strut. (Refer to the opposite strut). Just place the socket in the strut over the ball joint on the vehicle, and give it a little tap or squeeze with your hand. It should snap right on.7. Repeat on the other strut.Note- if it seems like the strut is too big, the hood is probably not open all the way. There is NO WAY you are strong enough to compress the strut by hand.I'd strongly recommend replacing them in pairs, otherwise you will get a twisting motion on your hood. Plus if one failed, the other one is close behind.That's it, you're done. Truly an impressive assembly of 4 parts. If there is a finer example of a little piece of rubbery roll-y wheel attached to a wooden handle with some metal parts in the middle tying it all together, show me.

I bought some really bad fuse holders that had some horrible fuses included. I had to replace the fuses with the ones from this ATD. These fuses are great quality and they include all the common fuse sizes which is great. This is a sweet buy when you consider your local auto parts store asks $3-$5 for just a pack of 3 fuses in one size. You get alot of fuses in the most common amperage's. Please note these are just one size fuse, There is still one size larger blade fuse and two smaller sizes. Check what you have before ordering. Personally I got them for my fuse-able links I'm adding for all the accessories I have added to my vehicle. When you do any accessory installs in your vehicle I recommend fusing at the point you tapped power from. Better safe than sorry. When ordering this ball I didn't realize the dimensions. I know they come in two sizes, but didn't realize how big it really is until I opened the amazon box today...no biggie, it'll still work. If your planning on doing rims or small areas, you should get the little guy! Great buy though....... Have not yet needed to use them, bought them for when I do need them. I am however, very impressed with the quality of the cables. The bag they came in is durable, handy, convenient & good quality. The price was outstanding for these cables. They are low profile to ensure that they do not rub on the wheel well. Only issue I had, was attempting to purchase another set of the rubber tensioner in case one breaks. Amazon did not seem to offer more than one size, which of course was not the size I needed. Most reviews caution you to have an extra, or you could find yourself in trouble if one side breaks. So if anyone knows where to buy extra tensioners, please let me know. 
There are 2 part numbers out there for this product.... I have 15&#34; wheels on my 5th wheel so I ordered the larger one... I tried this out just for fit and I think this will work perfectly to secure wheels when one side is up on leveling blocks and can't be chocked. Fits on my Hi-Lift jack just fine. Does exactly what it is supposed to do.If you are using it on wheels that are deep make sure the straps are long enough to reach the spoke pattern. I have an old 55 GMC with a Napco 4wd on 37 inches tires and it stands pretty high. Even getting to the oil dip stick is a challenge without a step.That tire step is really great, it unfolds and installs in 2 seconds over the tire. It fits my 37x12.5 (it won't work with a bigger tire) and is pretty stable.It comes with a nice pouch with handles to carry it with you everywhere you go. It folds nicely and can be stored under your seat. A really great item, and I am considering buying a 2nd one so that I can have one on each side when I am working in the engine bay of the truck. 
If you wash your car with a bucket, there is no reason why you should not have one of these at the bottom of your &#34;dirty water&#34; bucket! If you don&#34;t know what I am talking about then move on this isn't for You! I don't know what the water is like in all the campgrounds we go to, and don't want to have to check the water! Having this attached to the water supply is just plain common sense! i bought it thinking it was shinier than the cheaper ones that come in a spray canister. i was wrong they are pretty much the same. and little annoying things like not properly labeling the nozzle to let you know if your spraying wide or narrow is a pain. you have to spray to know whether the on setting is narrow or wide. this is my first week using it and i gotta tell yah this thing doesn't look like its going to last, even gingerly spraying this on my tire is wasting the spray at an alarming rate. i don't know if its just my bottle that came a little cracked but whenever i spray somehow someway the liquid leaks through the openings and gets all over my hands.other than that, the seller is fast and the package came in good condition. 
This works exactly as you expect. If your gap is too small, you can just slightly tilt the entire gauge while measuring the gap, and the gap will extend some... that is, measure, push to extend, re-measure, and repeat until you have the right gap.You can also use the inside of the small ring area to expand the gap. This is where I think the tool could improve. The small edge of the wedge on the inner ring could be smaller. Once, I happened to tap my gap too small to fit on that wedge, and had some trouble getting the gap to open back up enough to again work on the gauge.All in all, though, this is a necessity in my motorcycle tool bag. The size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous. The funnel is 10" long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6" long. It states that the funnel is 4" x 4" but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2-1/4" in diameter at the widest point.It would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless. Easy to replace. It lacks Toyota instructions, but it is exactly like existing Toyota part with all wires colored the same way so it is very obvious how to connect those.The original part has a silicone rubber tube going all the way from top to bottom with wires running inside it. This part only provides a short length of tubing that, at best, would cover half of the length of wires on my car.I thing they should provide a &#34;telescoping&#34; tubing of two diameters with one going inside of the other while you are crimping wires and then extended to cover the full length of wires 
I would install this on your Jeep as soon as you purchase the vehicle.  They're very easy to install and protect you from scratches that could lead to rust.  The guards fit perfectly on my 2011 Jeep Rubicon 2 door. They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Even though Amazon says it does not fit my truck; it does fit my 2002 Chevrolet 2500HD crew cab with 6.0L gas engine. I replaced both sensors and harness. Both sensors were rough looking and the rear sensor had standing water on it. It was a little bit of a chore to get to them because you have to remove the intake but it was not too bad. 
These are typical hard plastic handles, contoured for grip. The stock bar is substantial at 7/16". Edges are finished nicely. The metal shaft is unpolished and has a finish to prevent slippage.I don't care if all my hand tools are the same color, if it matters to you then note these may come in a different color than illustrate (see my pics).Made in the U.S.A. - nice.j Yes, these are wheel chocks.  They're not fancy, but they will hold a round piece of rubber just fine. These are not your cheap run of the mill clips. They are very thick and durable; solder joints on clips are good too. This product is definitely well made. 
our 32' travel trailer w/ three slideouts has the factory electric stabilizer jacks at the front and back, which are great at stabilizing the ends.  But in between these, over the axles, we can feel the trailer flex and slightly bounce especially when we are entertaining & have folks congregate in the middle.  These work really well when placed just in front of the tires.  We simply crank them up snug against the frame rail on each side.  Now the trailer doesn't bounce or wiggle nearly at all.  Too bad RV manufacturers on long wheel base units don't add in a third stabilizer in the mid section to keep up/down flex movement of leaf springs & tires from causing bounce feeling. We also have the BAL X-jacks between the tires to prevent any roll effect from front to back. These are solid jacks for trailers that sit high. I use two of these jacks on a small off-road box trailer that's pulled by a Jeep so it sits high. The trailer has a rough top tent mounted on top of it, and with these the trailer is stable with jacks underneath. They're easy to adjust and level the trailer out.I did however find one of the chains was broken for a pin. It's a minor issue but I can't give it a perfect rating for that reason. i have a jeep XJ cherokee with about 6" of lift and 33" tires.  I have a 48" hi-lift jack.  I got the smaller one mainly b/c of space as i wanted it to fit under my rear seat in my jeep.  With the 48" i can use my front bumper or my rocker rails as jack points, however it would be pretty difficult to get a tire off the ground unless i maxed out the jack.  This item helps a lot to raise the wheel off the ground and be able to put something underneath the wheel for better traction like a log or rock.  My only small complaint is that there is a nut that holds this onto your hi-lift.  would be better if the nut was a bit longer and that it came with a wing nut instead of a lock nut.  Otherwise the build quality is very good, it has a rubber pad that goes up against the tire.  The hooks are extremely strong and the straps are stitched very very well. 
Need one say more?  And, these can be locked in place using a small lock you put in the tightening head (lock not included).  Once in place between the wheels on a tandem axle trailer, there's no way the trailer will move.  Cool! I found out by accident that on my RV, you can simply push down on the round "handle" that is on the slider, and that will open the door. So at least for my RV ( 2012 Keystone Springdale TT ) this device is not needed. You might want to try it on yours too. This was not in any manual that came with my RV, but it is clearly designed to work this way. The slider is spring loaded in the vertical dimension. I installed one of these springs at the bottom of the door.  As others have said, 1 seems plenty strong to close the door without making it slam.  If you only hold the door a few inches open, it won't latch.  But if you open it like you are walking out it will close tight and the latch engages.I think installing the second spring will make the door slam too hard.  But its nice having the second spring just in case you need it.I installed it using the existing screw on the outside of the screen door (where the hinge attaches).  I think measured up 9" (as the directions say) and drilled a hole such that the spring fits between the screen door and the outside door when they are both closed.- to be clear - when you are standing outside the camper, with the screen door closed, you see the spring go from the hinge on the screen door to the door frame.The pictures in the directions seemed a little confusing to me.  It looks more like they want you to put the spring on the inside of the door.  But then you have the spring dragging across the frame when you open the door, scratching the frame and probably making a lot of noise.My way of installing it has zero noise (the spring is not rubbing on anything) and it works nicely.Just make sure there is adequate clearance between your outside door and your screen door before installing the spring.I will take a picture if I get a chance and post it.*** UPDATE ***I added a picture with notes.We had the camper out for 5 days and the spring worked great.  Using just 1 spring is enough to close the screen door and it even will pull the combined screen & exterior doors closed.  (not hard enough to latch, but closed).  I think I will leave it as-is and keep the second spring as a backup. 
Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. It locks and unlocks well with a &#34;positive&#34; engagement feel when it is secure. Fits great for both my front bumper receiver and rear receiver on my 2005 Dodge Ram.  No complaints, and I'd definitely buy it again. i have a jeep XJ cherokee with about 6" of lift and 33" tires.  I have a 48" hi-lift jack.  I got the smaller one mainly b/c of space as i wanted it to fit under my rear seat in my jeep.  With the 48" i can use my front bumper or my rocker rails as jack points, however it would be pretty difficult to get a tire off the ground unless i maxed out the jack.  This item helps a lot to raise the wheel off the ground and be able to put something underneath the wheel for better traction like a log or rock.  My only small complaint is that there is a nut that holds this onto your hi-lift.  would be better if the nut was a bit longer and that it came with a wing nut instead of a lock nut.  Otherwise the build quality is very good, it has a rubber pad that goes up against the tire.  The hooks are extremely strong and the straps are stitched very very well. 
There are plenty of RV Park type campgrounds out there.  However I like the scenic view and smells of a wooded campground.  There's just one problem with these.  In my area of the country, these are usually built on a ridge and the pads aren't always as level as they could be.  For owners of most larger rigs, you know well that the stablizer jacks have NO ability to level a trailer that isn't level.  Enter the Camco Tri-Levelers.  Back your trailer into within 18" of your intended final stopping point on the pad.  Lay a pair of these right behind the rear tires of the trailer, making sure their parallel with the tires.  Back up until you've achived your desired height.  On asphalt these will not move.  Then use a pair of standard chalks to chalk the front tires.  After that, your set, drop your trailer and set it up.Why do you need them?  Of course, camp long enough and you'll see everything from people driving their trailers onto 2x8s to slabs of concrete.  These are MUCH safer, will not rot, will not slide, and will not crack.  They are study and made of think ridged plastic.  Each one I would say weighs about 5 lbs so they'll still be lighter than anything else you carry.  And they will last forever!  You could safely leave these under your rig for years without worrying about damage from weather or sunlight.Why not 5 stars?  Three reasons...  1) It's not safe to use these on your own without a spotter.  An experienced RVer can back his rig onto a pad with no assistance.  However with these it's just not safe.  You could easily back off the back edge since the rear lip is no taller than the ones to each tier of leveling.  2) These are only suitable you rearward sloping pads with minimal side-to-side slope.  Due to the face that these are only 18" long they cannot level a tandem axel trailer from side to side as both axels will not touch the leveler.  And they are too long to fit a second Tri-leveler under the front tire for standard trailers.  Though side-to side leveling would be possible for single axel trailers.  3) Final placement is important as it could damage your tires (especially if being left for a season.)  When I use them and the trialer is still hiched it pinches the tire.  After leveling this seems to go away.  But if it didn't and you were concerned for your tires, this would mean rehitching and adjusting.  Each level is only about 5" long by approximately 9" wide.  So tire contact can be an issue.  For more agressive slopes, my recommendation after using them a couple of times.  Drive you rig onto them until the rear of the chock (whichever level your using) is pinching your tire.  And making sure you don't drive off the back!  Then when you let the tongue down it will stop pinching and sould be just right.Final thoughts...  These levelers are purpose built for the most common type of leveling.  They do very well at that.  They don't do well with other types of leveling.  Though I suppose you could use them with a foward slope as well if you were creative with your tongue jack.  If it seems like I'm being critical of them, I'm just trying to give an honest review.  I do think they are a great, well built product that is worth owning if you enocounter this type of issue with your trailer.  If you have issues with side-to-side leveling, there are other products out there that will suit you better as well as cost you more.  Personally I own both since I never know what type of situation to expect.  I like the simple design.  No assemlby means they're easy to move.  Unless the situation requires it I will always grab these first for just that reason.  One final thing to consider.  Anytime you raise a tire or pair of tires on your trailer you're obviously going to have a more significant rise on the end of your trailer.  Make sure your carrying something to let you sill use your stablizing jacks. This seems to be one of the better levelers. There are two different scales on these levels. One is for the side-to-side (back of the coach) and the other is for the front-to-back (side of the coach). The reason there are different scales are they are more-or-less calibrated in inches.For example, it is simple Trigonometry to determine how many inches the coach is out of level simply by using the formula for right-angles and solve for one side. The input values are the angle (determined by the level) and distance from the level to the point at where you want to know how many inches of lift are needed.For the side-to-side level, the 1&#34; markings are pretty accurate as long as you put the scale in the center of the coach, as most coaches are within an inch or two of width from another.  However, for the front-to-back level, even though you put the scale in the center, the result will vary wildly due to the length of the coach. Using this level on a 18ft coach will result in a far different measurement than say a 35ft coach.Also, if you don't put the level in the center (in the side or back), then the two ends of the coach will be different. For example, if the level is in the center, then when the level measures 1&#34; off level, that means 1&#34; on either front or back. But if you put the level off-center, then the level reading 1&#34; might truly be 1/2&#34; on one end, and 1 1/2&#34; on the other. Again, it is simply a principle of Right Angles in Trigonometry.Also, do not rely on the self-adhesive backing as over time it can move. As hard as it may be for you to do, drilling a couple holes and inserting screws into the levels is the best bet. I grew up in the 80's so I remember well playing with Legos.  Building everying from cars to forts.  Well the Tri Lynx Comapny has brought us back our nostalic youth with Tri Lynx Levelers.  These are large square plastic pads (roughly 9"x9"x1" thick) that are stackable to just about any confgiuration you can imagine.  You can stack them in a "column" fasion for leveling jacks.  Or you can stack them in an offset alternating "brick wall" fasion for an interlocking leveler that is safe to drive on without fear of displacement.  They can even be stacked side by side for larger duel wheel RVs.  For my use, I wanted to use them for my leveling jacks and for pads were there was a side leaning tilt.  The box says to never stack more than 4 levelers high for a single configuration.  I've gone to 10 under my jacks and they still feel rock solid once pressure is put on them.I'm on my 4th set of Lynx levelers.  I'm convinced you can't have too many.  With that I fianlly invested in these "Stop'n Chocks"  Wonderful!!!  As I said these can be used under your wheels as well.  So the Stop n' Chalk stacks as the last piece at the rear of the Lynx configuration to allow the driver  just back up against them.  Now these are the most versitle set of leveling / chalking pads you can buy becasue they allow for front to rear leveling and side to side leveling.  If one side of the coach is lower than the other, you can build up just that side and use standard chalks on the other.  Also if you have enough of the Tri Lynx levelers you could potentially place say 2" of lift under a front axel on an tandem configuration and 4 or even 5" under a rear.  The one draw back is that you would need enough to building this as one continous pad (say 8' long or so.)  But like legos, if you have enough, your imagination is the limit.A couple of notes:  You MUST use these in conjunction with TriLynx levelers.  They will not work on their own.  In addition there is a noctch carved out of the front to force the user to stack in the above mentioned "brick wall" alternating fasion so that there's no risk of sepertaion between the levels as the rig is driving on or off the pad.  Also, I stongly suggest a spotter!  Driving a rig on or off a 9" wide "rail" is dangerous and having someone to tell you that you a little too close to the edge is a must. 
The &#34;feet&#34; on this bar slides off the truck bed sides and makes it worthless.When the ratchet is extended, the mechanism for that ends up out of arms reach when standing outside the truck. These scrapers always break at the smallest part of the handle right behind the head. I heated up a length of 3/4 PVC conduit and slid it over the entire handle,allowing it to spread out slightly at the scraper head. Works like a charm, and now it's long enough to reach the center of my truck windshield! our 32' travel trailer w/ three slideouts has the factory electric stabilizer jacks at the front and back, which are great at stabilizing the ends.  But in between these, over the axles, we can feel the trailer flex and slightly bounce especially when we are entertaining & have folks congregate in the middle.  These work really well when placed just in front of the tires.  We simply crank them up snug against the frame rail on each side.  Now the trailer doesn't bounce or wiggle nearly at all.  Too bad RV manufacturers on long wheel base units don't add in a third stabilizer in the mid section to keep up/down flex movement of leaf springs & tires from causing bounce feeling. We also have the BAL X-jacks between the tires to prevent any roll effect from front to back. 
This works great. It's sturdy and fit's nice and snug in a standard 5 gallon bucket. I will be ordering more of these in the future. just  recived  these  prefect  fit would  tell any one in of these  to buy  these you  wont  besorry  you did Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. 
I used these two jack stands to hold a Nissan Maxima front end up and they worked without any issues. I will be testing the locking pins to see if they will hold the weight when the latch arm is pulled because I'm curious. Installed these on a 1999 Jeep XJ Cherokee in about 20 mins start to finish and they work as well or better than the factory lifts that came on the Jeep.Same part number fits both right and left sides, you simply have to flip the upper bracket over on one of them with your finger to have it fit the other side.I will certainly buy this brand again when needed.Standard shipping was very fast and product was delivered in perfect condition. Bought them with the cruiser plates and while they did fit the plates they did not fit the wholes on the car. Dont know why. Work fine on the front but not the rear. Also they are security screws, so do not lose the device that comes with them. FYI 
Got these for $25 shipped, and they look good.  Can't understand why Chrysler does not include these from the factory. I did not receive what is shown in the picture.  It does not have the two round lids that turn on top, but rather a hinged lid held by two thumb screws.  Doesn't really matter, as it works just the same.  This is a nice cover, and I'm happy with it.  It looks better than the one it replaced. I bought these to haul my two kayaks.  Works great.  I would have given 5 stars, but it does not come with any reflectors or padding material.  Also, the flag it comes with was missing my first order, Amazon sent me a new one, but the flag is real cheap...just a piece of red thin plastic. 
I purchased 2 packages of these coil compressors (so 4 compressors total) a while back knowing i would need them to swap out a set of springs from 1998 Chev Camaro.  I was installing shocks and lowering coils to improve handling and get rid of some body roll.  On the Camaro, the rear is a solid axle so the coils and shocks install separately (its not a coil over shock system as in the front).  While compressing the rear spring, I ran out of room...the threaded bar portion was making contact with the top of the coil's housing so i used the extra 2 compressors i had to compress the coil further until i could remove it...So the compressors did their job easily. its a good product and very well made however, you may need 3-4 of these compressors to help further compress the coils.on the front, the coils and shocks were out of the car so no space issues and two compressors easily compressed the coil...i used 3 to be safe. The provided foam spacers and fit was perfect on my 2013 JEEP OEM hitch receiver.  Sturdy and well made.  The one I received had round corners so I did not have to 'modify' it as some other's stated they had to do.  I will not leave this permanently in my hitch and the weather, since there is potential for moisture to get into it.  If you put keys in this I'd suggest a zip log bag.  There are two holes in the back of the unit which I suspect is to allow moisture to escape, I thought about using Silicone RTV to close those up, but decided against it.  Weather, and especially near coastal areas, will probably corrode the combo lock at some point so I will not leave it permanently installed, and will keep in my cab until I need it. I purchased two of these for my kids' key chains as a "back-up" (and will probably purchase a couple more).  When they arrived, I tested them on glass cola bottles, and both functioned repeatedly as they were designed to do... bottles were shattered.  These should function repeatedly until the spring wears out, so TEST THEM when you receive them, and if they fail to function... demand a replacement!Like I said, I purchased these as back-ups, not as a primary device.  Each of our vehicles have an "original hammer" either in the door pocket, center-console, or glove box (mounting them to the dash or door with the included mount is the preferred method, but why mount them when the door pocket or center console have hinged covers that will keep it from "wandering off").  If someone is trapped and cannot reach these locations, the keychain version will be a second-best option, and will always be within easy reach of the driver or passenger!You can't beat the functionality of the original hammer... NO MOVING PARTS.  I have had to use one of the original hammers to break though the rear window of a Blazer that flipped over on the Interstate in front of me several years ago.  The first guy on the scene couldn't break the glass after several attempts with a crow-bar, but my hammer shattered the glass on the first try!  The hammer worked flawlessly, and with little effort. 
I have a pair of these stands bought about a year ago and have put them to very good use.  These stands are light weight and very sturdy.  Got a second pair to add to my collection for tire rotation.  I'm planning to use a pair on each side when I'm working under the front of the vehicle to access the O2 sensors. Five stars for price and for doing exactly what it is supposed to do.  It also seems to be unbreakable in that it survived shipping.  Amazon didn't pack the box very well; I guess taking the manufacturer at its word and the claim that it is unbreakable.  I purchased two of these, both of which came in boxes that were utterly smashed up by heavier items in the box.  Both arrived unscathed anyway, although with one, the two halves had come apart.  It slid back together easily, so no big deal.I am using these on standard HVAC registers in our new house.  In two places we ended up needing to place furniture over top of a register.  We wanted something to direct the airflow out from under the furniture instead of blowing air into the bottom of it.  These do that well, and the magnets have held them in place.  Just slide the sides apart to the width you need and set them down.  Done.  I would recommend them, and will buy more if we rearrange things and need to cover other registers. They work just great for what I want.  I have two sets of them that I use on my travel trailer.  Will buy two more sets when the others that I use wear out. 
Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.  The pickle fork is the last resort for me, as it will damage the balljoint boot.I prefer to use the Snap On balljoint remover.  If that one cannot fit, then I will try this tool.  If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork. I haven't really used it yet for the reason intended, changing the oil in my jet ski.  So, I can't comment on how well it works.  The main reason for this review is to put it out there that it does not work with a 2000 Chevy Silverado.  The siphon tube does not fit thru the bottom of the dip stick tube.  It would be really nice if Mityvac had a published list of what vehicles it works with and what ones it does not.  I have my fingers crossed that it'll work with my jet ski, otherwise there will be a new/(un)used Mityvac on *****'slist.  Long story short, do your research to see if you can confirm or deny if it will work with your vehicle before you buy it. There are 2 part numbers out there for this product.... I have 15&#34; wheels on my 5th wheel so I ordered the larger one... I tried this out just for fit and I think this will work perfectly to secure wheels when one side is up on leveling blocks and can't be chocked. 
When I purchased the Torin creeper seat I didn't take into account it might have a weight limit. I mean of course it would have *some* limit but nothing in the Amazon ad that I saw suggested a very specific maximum weight of a person that the seat could take.It was therefore disappointing to see on the packaging the words 'holds 250lbs!' in big lettering on the front. I'm a big tall guy at around 350lbs - heck if I was 250lbs I'd be a stick. So I thought I'd just squash it if that's its maximum weight limit... but I chose to assemble it anyway since it was so inexpensive and just see how it handled my girth. First thing I noticed was it was mostly nearly all constructed despite the assembly instructions indicating I would have to mount the wheels and the plastic to the base etc. In reality all I had to do was bolt on the U brackets and the seat. Done. Took about 10 minutes. The lower plastic was ever so slightly cracked though, due I'd say to over tightening at the factory but it's not a deal breaker and hasn't affected the functionality of the seat.Once together I sat down and swung around one of my bikes and began to clean it. I have to say that the seat made a massive difference in my cleaning routine where often I'd be laying on the cold floor. Now I'm sitting upright and much more comfortable albeit really low - I might source taller brackets at some point as it feels short for a man of my height. But it's still infinitely preferable to sitting and laying on the ground. Being able to smoothly scoot around the vehicle with tools in tow speeds things up hugely and is very welcome.At the end of about two hours of cleaning, the Torin TR6300 creeper seat looked exactly the same and not at all squished thankfully, and I'm really glad I bought it. I bought this to pull small logs and brush around our farm. I got stuck in a creek bed which was MUCH softer than I thought.  My '96 Ford F250 diesel weighs over 7500lbs with an extra fuel tank on it. It is a heavy truck, but it's no semi or anything.  I got pulled out by some guys in a smaller Nissan pickup, which was light enough not to sink in the creek.  They took a "rolling start" of FIVE FEET, not more, which completely straightened out the hook!!! I don't know if I got one that somehow missed the tempering process, but what a piece of $***. Just for more background, the 10 foot tow strap was rated at 5000lbs, so the force required to straighten this hook was less than that. It might as well have been made from aluminum.  I can't complain too much at under $20, but I thought smittybuilt meant quality.  I wasn't taking a 20mph go at a stump or anything.  I'm glad that I could attach my strap to the frame easily enough.  If it had been an emergency situation I'd have been buggered. I'm a newbie RV person (though I'm 74 years old) so took advice of others on blogs and ordered a 25' and a 50' hose for my new travel trailer.  The threads on the female end are plastic so I'm hopeful they will hold up.  They do have a 10 year warranty.  I unrolled them today and had no kinking when I carefully stretched them out.  Since they were wrapped tightly for shipping I assuming under normal use they will serve their purpose well. 
The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around! Clipped onto the doorlock and door latch rods securely and installed onto the inner door release handle nice and firm.  Worked perfectly. used it on my 1994 f150 2wd for the rear end cover. Sealed it without any issues! Did not seem to work well when i tried to use it on the plastic center cap though 
Good price and when ordering several still comes into Australia cheaper and arrives at the front door. Typical NGK quality. I bought this for my 97 f150 and was very surprised at the cheap price for a quality price. very impressed! What can be said. RV store in town 3 times the price, Amazon online for the same product is a blast at 1/3 the price. Switches work well, wire solder joints are good and the bulbs were all included. Did the job well, mounted perfectly in a 12 volt powered outdoor shop building and a RV ( I bought a bunch), Soon to buy more. 
I can't wait till I can detail my car again. Winter's are so depressing to look at your car, inside and out. This stuff works well and smells good too. Come on Spring! No experience on how long it will hold up yet, but after spraying it on new exhaust wrap, it definitely &#34;seals&#34; it all together.  It also allows me to touch it with my arm and not get it full of fiberglass. I couldn't get to the lower adjusting screw with a ratchet, too thick and not long enough. This thing has a long handle on it and the ratcheting head is fairly thin. I was able to adjust my driver's headlight out of oncoming traffic's eye. 
Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars Great Fit Works as needed, only problem is it will only fit a standard oil jug not the gallon. 
As everyone else points out, this intake tube will make your engine sound louder during moderate to heavy acceleration, but that is simply because it eliminates the factory resonance chamber.  The minimum cross section is the same as your stock tube so its not capable of flowing any more air than stock.  It still has the sharp 90 degree turn to the throttle body that the OEM system has.  There may be some minor reduction of turbulance, but at most engine speeds, especially where the engine spends most of its time, it won't matter.  I've never seen an independent  dyno test published with a before and after with just this mod.  Clearly the postings on Airaid's site are BS.  If something this simple could increase HP and torque by 5% across the RPM band, it would be incorporated into your car from the factory.  I doubt there is any HP improvement but there might be 1 or 2 HP gain.  Not enough to feel and not enough to measure with a G-tech on 1/8 mile runs.  On my 5.3 there was zero improvement in mileage over 40K miles of driving compared to before.  This includes some 400 mile runs pulling a 6000lb trailer.  It does look better than the stock set up and it really makes your motor sound like it has more power.  If that does it for you, buy one - its well made and fits great.  If you want a few more HP, save your money for a DiabloSport Predator or similar.  Only negative with the tube is you need to loosen the clamp at the throttle body to service your stock air filter because the coupling is not as flexible as the original (it doesnt need to be). To be honest, there are tons of these gap gauges around, made by all sorts of different companies. I dont actually think that this gap gauge is any better than the others, but it does its job, so it deserves 5 stars. On top of that, im dealing with iridium plugs, so you would need a gap gauge like this to do the job right. (the coin gap gauge will damage your precious metal!!!)Great stuff overall! A must have tool to work on any car, if your check or fixing electrical problems, it makes the connecting and disconnecting that much easier, and you don't have to break anything with this tool!! 
This is a perfect fit for my 2008 Z06.  I love the wrench fitting that I can use to get a good grip on the filter when removing.  I hand tighten, but things always seem tighter than that when I go to remove.  Now I don't have to wrestle removing the filter. Works as will as other seal pullers I've used.When using a seal puller for my 16&#34; FV wheels I've found that I need to use the assistance of a 5 lbs hammer to pull the seal.Of cource replace the seal with a new one. This is a common practice of RV repair shops. This thing seems extremely well made, even if it isn't made in the USA. I had a cheap gun before this and blew the seals on the second use. This pumped grease into some well rusted fittings with ease.My only complaint is the hose fitting that attaches to the zerks. Yes, it is a 2 piece design as many have mentioned which is both good and bad. If you have easily accessible zerks that need a lot of pressure, you can screw this on and use both hands to pump. However, large u-joints can be a huge pain as I can't get anything in to tighten the fitting. I found I had to keep making adjustments then sticking it in the joint until I found the perfect setting where it fit on the zerk but didn't lose grease. However, there were a few joints where I was unable to find this balance and couldn't get them to take grease. I will have to buy a different hose to get them all. 
Well built with a weatherproof cover; comes with two keys and will protect your hitch or what ever you need to protect. This treatment works well to &#34;kill&#34; rust and should be used along with a good rust primer and top coat paint to prevent future reoccurrence of corrosion returning. This product essentially treats the rust as the surface of the metal becomes pitted and sanding or grinding does not remove all of it before painting. Good product to use in any area you do not want to continually do over. This product is an absolute must to have on the shelf for any auto or product used in high salt states such as in the Northeast area of the country. Small price to pay for an added layer of security to your rust prevention project. Decent coverage, easy to install.  Should be a factory installed item to help reduce interior wear.  Easy to install with double sided tape, hopefully this will withstand moisture and other conditions and remain in place.  Being Mopar, I would expect it to do so. 
Keeps all my batteries &#34;hot&#34;. coupled with the 12.5&#34; extensions I can hang it on the wall and use them year round for all my Electric start devices.. I have this item hooked on my motorcycle with the loop connection, so it can be quick hooked or unhooked for summer time. I have used these for years on motorcycles and cars. At work these get used on floor sweepers, generators, hydraulic pumps, anything that has a battery that needs to work but may sit for a long time. Unlike most charger/maintainers, this has a de-sulfate mode that can bring back abused batteries. Sometimes you need a dedicated charger to get them going and then this to condition them. Unless you have plenty of time to spare, in which case this will eventually bring back a worn down battery. Has the common two prong connector, alligator clips to go directly to battery terminals and enough cord length to be useful. The only gripe I have is the serial number on the registration card is the same for all of them. There is a statement that I can get an LED display with registering the unit. I have done this and eventually received a display unit about 2 months later. Then I found them for $4 at Harbor Freight. For the money, these maintain your batteries and work well. They will take up space on an outlet strip though. 
Nicely made and fits my HJC CL-16 helmet perfectly. For cold weather use, you might want some type of anti-fog insert also. While designed for marine applications where the fuel sits for extended periods, I use it to protect my 4KW RV generator when in storage. Though Amazon stated this cap would not fit my 2013 Ford E-450 chassis (for a Jayco, Class C, Greyhawk, RV), I ordered it anyway as it fits many other years of Ford trucks and looks the same. It is rare for the same vehcle to change a design like that. It, in fact, fits perfectly. Our RV gas filler has no cover (not that that is a deterrant) and 60 gallons is a target for remote theft of gas, or a target for vandalism. This cap fits well. I have not been able to fit the stock cap-retainer onto it yet. I understand these modern vehicles have anti siphon plugs but one can still end up with foreign substances in the exposed fill-tube. This is a good 'ounce of prevention'.Highly recommended. 
I used this on the interior walls of the air chamber of my fireplace insert to absorb the blower noise.  I did not notice a dramatic difference.  It is on the bottom of the plenum where the cool air goes in, not in the top portion.  There were no problems with odor or melting from the heat radiating through the bottom.  I don't know what would happen if I burned wood without turning on the blowers. ...oil to water, this agent will solve any need you have to patch, bond, fix, fill, attach, mend, glue, fasten, stick, plus it is resilient to cold, heat, vibration and surfaces can be slick or porous.I used Ultra Black until this came out and.yes it does make great gaskets but that is only the biginning. I fixed tears in my kayak, patched up my.boots, bonded a toaster oven under counter...anyways, you should get the idea by now. I lube my slideout and other seals and gaskets on my motorhome about twice a year.  This works well on the gaskets of the storage compartments.  Be aware that it is really messy to spray on.  You have to open your slides to access the seals, and this comes out of the can similar to engine degreaser - a foam that is messy.  It gets on the painted surfaces and needs to be wiped off promptly. With a straw from another lube can, I can spray it on the top gasket which is almost impossible to reach.  For the side gaskets on the slideout, I find that it is less messy to put on a plastic glove, spray it in my hand, and rub it on.  Works okay that way.  If you are on the road, and your slideout seal is sticking or binding, try baby power. This is an effective product, but Thetford needs to change the nozzle to control the mess. 
I had a need for dielectric grease and this fit my needs.....I use it on my motorcycles ,cars, boat and trucks. on ignition /wiring connections. keeps dirt  and moisture out and makes for great electrical connections.  pricey ,but I have to have it. I love it. Can also use to leave vehicle outside so the BatteryMinder ( Tender ) stays dry in the garage, if it rains outside. A must have for me. I want to protect this wonderful charger and keep it on the shelf, not under the hood in a hot engine bay. This is an excellent product.  It really works best with Mercedes and BMWs where they also have the oil filter on the top of the car so you dont even need to get under the car to remove the oil filter.  Ive also used this on my Audi, which it works fine, but you still need to get under it to get the oil filter out.Also should point out, this wont work on some domestics because the way they snake their dipsticks into the oil pan.  Clear example is the Dodge Ram 04.  It comes with a tubing small enough to fit practically any car, but the dipstick on this truck snakes through to major curves so didnt work on that car.But I can say it will work for almost any import or german car.Dixit 
i use this lube all around the house....door hinges, oven hinges, key locks, sliding door tracks etc.works nicely and doesnt leave a visual layer....dries invisible Clever item. You can push all your refrigerator items back and hold them there while traveling. To lengthen, you have to unscrew the upper and bottom rod. Then you have to twist them while holding in place in the fridge to tighten them. This product is well made and comes in handy when you want to climb out of your Jeep. It is easy to put on and does its job very well. The size of the grip itself is perfect as your hand can wrap around it, for a good surface to hold onto, instead of grabbing onto the roof. 
Was concerned the door would slam based upon the other reviews so just mounted the one spring.  If you open the door all the way, i.e., right up to the outside wall it won't pull it shut unless you give it a little nudge back but opening halfway it gently closes the door.  Installation was straightforward and easy and I am not particularly a good instruction interpreter. I installed one of these springs at the bottom of the door.  As others have said, 1 seems plenty strong to close the door without making it slam.  If you only hold the door a few inches open, it won't latch.  But if you open it like you are walking out it will close tight and the latch engages.I think installing the second spring will make the door slam too hard.  But its nice having the second spring just in case you need it.I installed it using the existing screw on the outside of the screen door (where the hinge attaches).  I think measured up 9" (as the directions say) and drilled a hole such that the spring fits between the screen door and the outside door when they are both closed.- to be clear - when you are standing outside the camper, with the screen door closed, you see the spring go from the hinge on the screen door to the door frame.The pictures in the directions seemed a little confusing to me.  It looks more like they want you to put the spring on the inside of the door.  But then you have the spring dragging across the frame when you open the door, scratching the frame and probably making a lot of noise.My way of installing it has zero noise (the spring is not rubbing on anything) and it works nicely.Just make sure there is adequate clearance between your outside door and your screen door before installing the spring.I will take a picture if I get a chance and post it.*** UPDATE ***I added a picture with notes.We had the camper out for 5 days and the spring worked great.  Using just 1 spring is enough to close the screen door and it even will pull the combined screen & exterior doors closed.  (not hard enough to latch, but closed).  I think I will leave it as-is and keep the second spring as a backup. i use this lube all around the house....door hinges, oven hinges, key locks, sliding door tracks etc.works nicely and doesnt leave a visual layer....dries invisible 
Bought these for my Vette.  The length of the ramp is not sufficient to get the car on and off without using wood extensions.  Getting on is OK, but getting off without the wood slipping and crashing the bumper is a real trick.  Have to bore a small hole in the wood and a small hole in the ramp to "lock the wood extension into place" to avoid slippage.Other than that, they work. I got this to aid in preventing uneven sanding to my truck bumpers while prepping the surface to accept paint. The block is rigid but soft and it easily accepts sand paper being wrapped around it. I was able to get a wider sanding path and keep it nice and even for a very nice scuffed surface for painting without getting an uneven paint job. I highly recommend this product. The cutting board is really nice!  Solid piece of wood and it has the RV shelf liner attached to it so it holds fast to the RV stove top.It also has the flexible plastic sheet (flexible stowaway cutting mat) included.  Wish I knew that before I bought the flexible plastic cutting mat but now I just have two. 
OEM quality, as mentioned, made in Japan.  The only gripe is the OEM cap has Honda screws that are have washer locks on them to keep them on the cap and thus less likely to drop while removing them.  The replacement screws are separate.  The cap also comes with a replacement gasket.TIP:  Always replace plug wires one at a time from the old cap to the new cap in the same order/rotation you pull from.May as well replace the rotor and coil while you are at it:Beck Arnley  173-7988  Ignition RotorOEM 5100A Ignition Coil It bothers me when front license plate is screwed directly to the bumper.  Considering the cost of these mounting brackets, I wish manufacturers included them as standard equipment; it would show their attention to detail.When I found Cruiser Accessories 79150 Mounting Plate it seemed like a good value.  I especially liked multiple slots for mounting onto the bumper.  These slots provide a good number of mounting and adjustment options.  I used the upper two vertical slots because they were spaced exactly like the existing holes in my car's front bumper.Unfortunately, there was a couple of frustrating issues that spoiled the experience:1.  Four screws that are included with the plate are too long.  I saw them being long and I am glad I checked for this before installing the mounting plate onto the front bumper.  I used included four screws to attach the license plate and the Black Cruiser Accessories 20050 Classic Lite frame to the mounting plate - screws' sharp tips protruded 1/4" from the back of the mounting plate.  If I had installed the mounting plate onto the bumper first and then tried to attach the license plate with the included screws, I would have damaged the front bumper in two places (the bottom two holes ended up over an air intake slot on my car).  I expect all pieces included with the product to be carefully engineered for that product and working properly.  These screws, obviously, are of the wrong size.  The fact that I had to go to Home Depot to find properly fitting screws not only was frustrating, but also increased the overall cost.2.  The thin pieces of plastic at the top and bottom of the mounting plate are too flimsy.  When I unpacked the plate, these areas of the mounting plate were slightly deformed: bent inwards. Fortunately, the license plate covered the problem.When the mounting plate is installed, it looks nice, so I am not completely disappointed; however, I found a similar product from Bell at Autozone, and it was cheaper (though Bell's mounting plate had very long screws too). These trickle chargers are just what the doctor ordered to keep your weekend cruisers charged and ready to roll. My luck being the way it is the battery clamps on my CTS are of a style that made adapting the included ring terminals very challenging. So the fix for my application was to order a lighter adapter and extension harness which is also conveniently available from Amazon. Even with the need for extra accessories I am happy with the product... 
We have an SUV. I would normally setup the side view mirrors so that when viewing the rear view mirrors and side view mirrors, there is just a bit of overlap when looking at them. This presents a problem when backing up as you cannot see the curbs clearly. So this helps a lot. The side mirrors are now just looking straight back helping in parallel parking as well backing up to a curb. These mirrors help in making sure that when you are driving and changing lanes, you can see if there is any object in your blindspot without glancing over your shoulders. Great mirrors and to this day, they remain clear. I will get another one - the smaller version of these mirrors - for my sedan. Not a bad mirror it's just a little on the large size for my side view mirror, but I'm getting used to it. Fits a little tight especially around the front fender and floorboards but it works.  I have a 03' Shadow ACE 750cc.  After a couple rain storms I can report my bike stayed dry (except a portion of the front wheel) and through heavy winds, the motorcycle cover stayed put.  What&#8217;s nice about this cover is the price and how it has elastic hooks to secure the cover in place.  If you decide to buy a cover and your bike has a windshield, floor boards and aftermarket mirrors I recommend you buy a 2XL (if your bike is similar in size to a Shadow 750cc).  Look at the picture I posted, mine has stock mirrors and no windshield and fits VERY tight.  My mirrors shift out of place when the cover is on.  Before each ride I have to adjust them cause the cover is soo tight.  Also, if you have floor boards that&#8217;ll make the fit even more tighter.  Buying one size bigger and I would say you bike will be 100% covered. 
The Tender Jr. does not come with a cigarette adapter so I cut this in half to make two. I purchased 2 lighter plugs for a buck each from China&#8230; with free shipping&#8230; and they are working fine. These aren&#8217;t an exact match with the Tender cables but they fit together OK and are easy to determine polarity with the wire colors. You can also just use this as an extension cord for your Tender. The description states a length of 12-inches&#8230; but it&#8217;s actually 14-inches tip-to-tip on the connectors. Nice item for the price and it&#8217;s made in Mexico. These are a good accessory to have because the clips are decent quality and the varied colors are helpful in keeping track of all the wires. The 2 x 2 Inch mirrors are a good fit for 2006 Honda Pilot. I had to order via Amazon since I couldn't find these anywhere - it appears local auto stores only carry the 3 x 3 inch size. These little blind spot mirrors are a must buy item - they cover the blind spots on either side of the vehicle very well. 
I bought this sway control to help my Daughter's towing of her travel trailer.  It fit her trailer and ball mount perfectly and helped control the trailer way on windy days. Fits very nicely onto the Northern Industrial Utility Trailer, i purchased the 40in. x 48in. trailer for hauling around a scooter store mobility scooter for my mother. this trailer jack and wheel makes a very nice addition, with it down the trailer is more like a little cart and it easily moves around the scooter. They fit perfectly onto the vehicle and or trailer wire when not in use. With the retaining loop they stay with the connectors when you are connected vehicle to trailer. 
Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars Exact fit for Lexus RX300. As easy to install as I could've expected with all parts: the sensor, the cable and  the plug matching the original layout. Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlander 
I haven't really used it yet for the reason intended, changing the oil in my jet ski.  So, I can't comment on how well it works.  The main reason for this review is to put it out there that it does not work with a 2000 Chevy Silverado.  The siphon tube does not fit thru the bottom of the dip stick tube.  It would be really nice if Mityvac had a published list of what vehicles it works with and what ones it does not.  I have my fingers crossed that it'll work with my jet ski, otherwise there will be a new/(un)used Mityvac on *****'slist.  Long story short, do your research to see if you can confirm or deny if it will work with your vehicle before you buy it. Exact replacement from OEM. Exact fit worked perfect . Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs. Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. 
Perfect fit for rear window on my 2004 Ford Excursion Limited. Easy to install. No spotting seen or squeaking at all Installed on a motorcycle works great.  Cord included allows for permanent install and can be used for accessories when not charging.  Great price. Simple install, 2-wire hookup. Works as advertised. It can be installed at 2 different angles, gives an option for mounting. 
Perfect fit for rear window on my 2004 Ford Excursion Limited. Easy to install. No spotting seen or squeaking at all Bought this to install with an aftermarket Kenwood Navigation 7120 on my 08 Toyota Tacoma.  It took several hours to install, but it works great with the wheel controls in my Toyota. This fits not only the Ecotec, but newer VW TDI's with the canister filter.  Works great, relatively low profile and goes nicely on a 3/8&#34; drive.  I accidentally ordered three (fat fingered the cart), and sold one to a fellow VW driver and one to a guy with a GM. 
Well built meter that functions just as it should.  The dials are easy to read and as far as I can tell the meter is accurate. This digital gauge is easy to use and to read, even in bright sun light. It has a wide range so you can use it on high pressure tires.Alot of gauges only go up to 60 psi which is too low for load range E tires. A number of reviewers have commented that the accuracy of this gauge is 0.1 psi.  It isn't.  The accuracy spec is +- 0.5 psi +- 1% of the reading.  This means that the gauge could show anything between 34.1 to 35.9 for a tire actually filled to 35 psi.Long story short...don't believe that 1/10 digit number that's being displayed.  If there's a slight change in tire pressure, it'll show it, but the actual value can vary significantly from what's shown. 
I am car-sitting a vehicle that mostly sits in my garage.  I don't drive it nearly enough to keep the battery charged.  I am also convinced that Fords have a damn trickle as this car drains a battery faster than anything else I have seen [maybe not as fast as a snooty BMW].  I spent a hoop of time looking on line for a quality product.  This one was well reviewed on many forums and after going to the factory web page I was convinced.  Amazon had the BEST price period.  I ordered four to start, one for Dad [has a truck he rarely drives], one for car I "baby-sit", one of wife's Jeep it sometimes does not get driven for days which is only a concern during cold Illinois winters, and my truck which always is outside [does not fit in garage] and thought it would be a good idea on those super cold nights when I also plug in my battery blanket and oil heater.I installed two so far and it was very easy!  The unit is designed to be permanently mounted under the hood, it comes with a bracket and some screws.  The first thing I did [I know it voids any warranty] is open it up and de-solder three wires from the short 12" cord and upgrade to a 14 gage 3 conductor cord of adequate single length.  I routed and zip-tied it to blend in with all of the other factory wires and ran it to the front lower valance [bumper] where I fabricated a simple aluminum bracket with grommet pull-through opening and terminated at a plug.  Now to use all I have to do is plug it in, no need to even open the hood.  With it disconnected you can barely see the plug from behind the license plate.  Total time about an hour and a half, if you are less particular I guess you could toss it in and be up and running in 10 minutes.  So far very happy, I have taken some measurements of the capabilities and thay are as claimed.  Almost forget, pics on amazon are not totally accurate, does not gome with a fuse holder for battery side.  I added a 5A blade fuse with all weather holder to the positive side between unit and battery for peace of mind. I just got the Ramps this week and used them for the first time TODAY on my 2003 Chevy Silverado Extended Cab with a 5.3.  It actually has a 2/4 Drop and 20" Wheels with 275/45R20 Tires.  I was on my Asphalt Driveway,  I put the Ramps right it front of my front tires, Get into my truck, and drove right up them!!! Didn't slip AT ALL.  There is a Rubber Pad in the middle Front, pretty thick, not large,  but it seemed to work for me.  I used to be a Professional Mechanic 3 months ago, and always had access to Racks.  I Changed Occupations for the better, and so I no longer have Rack access.  So I got a set of these.Again my truck is lowered, and so I was worried about a ramp not fitting under the front of my truck to drive up.  I had no problem with these like I said.  I put them right up Against the tire, and then drove right on up!!!  The Negative is it's not UP very high, at least on my lowered truck.  On my Low to the ground creeper, I could just get under to change the oil and oil filter.  I wanted to change the Fuel filter also, but that was ALMOST impossible.  It's along the frame railing back a bit near the front of the Gas tank,  I could barley get back enough to just reach the filter and 2 wrench it with one hand to get the filter off.  I did manage though.  I wish I could of do it on a rack at my old Job, but my old Boss is P.Oed that I left.  Now he has to work far more and hired a couple Idiots to take my place.  I wouldn't get my car worked on there now!!!I'm not going to knock it down any stars because it didn't lift my truck up enough as I knew how much it would raise it before I ordered them.  Again, No slipping for my truck and it's Rear Wheel Drive!!!  It didn't Sink in the Asphalt, or Crack, or anything else.  Nice and Solid.  The Price was right as $48, with no tax and free 2nd day shipping for me.  It's harder for me to do oil changes these days, having to do it at home, but then again, I've seen some of the work so called Pro Mechanics do on peoples cars/trucks from different places, and I think I'll stick doing most ALL that I can, other then things that just isn't feasible for me to do at home.  Things like Smog Check. I bought this item because my hydraulic jack was leaking and I always had to top it up everytime I wanted to use it, which alone can take me 15 to 20mins to do.  With this, I just drive up and in a matter of about 2 mins I'm ready to work on my car.  It makes my DIY fluid changes and inspections MUCH easier and quicker.I have a 2005 Mazda 3, and I have absolutely no problems with it sliding, moving, or touching when I drive up on it.Although my car is not even half the weight of the 8000lb capacity model, I bought the 12000lb version just to be on the safe side.I've had this product for just under a year, and I use it every 4 - 5 weeks.  I highly recommend it if you like to save money and do your own oil changes. 
The ANCO Contour is a decent curved blade providing an effective sweep. The "UB" part is the one that works with the flat cane-shaped connector, as opposed to the "OE" blades that comes with three adapter clips which appear to fit rectangular original equipment brackets on some vehicles. The compatibility list has been updated more accurately, but it is best to check before placing your order.Though not the most aesthetically handsome clip to look at, the "Kwik Connect" contour blade is easy to install and costs about as much as any other full blade assembly. I like it. We have used FOUR different towing mirrors on two different trucks in the past year.These actually work...although my wife is bothered by the F-150 inset mirror on the truck itself, having the 3rd mirror is unnerving to her, but these are SO much better than the strap on mirror setup you see on other systems.These do fit on 2013 F-150 trucks (just don't get for the STX -- different mirrors). I have a 2008 Ford F150 FX4 that has most every option including the mirrors with the turn signal indicator lamps immediately below the side mirrors.  I researched these trailer mirrors and although every formal resource, including the one from Amazon and the manufacturer, said this was not the trailer mirror for my truck, I found one review that said they took a chance and they fit and worked fine.  I had the same experience, they worked fine.  There are cut-outs that allowed the turn signal lamps to fuction perfectly fine and the shape of the mirror was a perfect fit!!

Pros: battery driven; flashing or steady light; flameless flare; can be used as a map light; reusable. Could be used effectively as a light that does not seriously degrade night vision.Cons: Product claims to be visible at 1000 ft, but this is only possible within a few degrees of view. One half of the top lights up for a dim presentation, but the bright LED shines out through a narrow beam like a small red flashlight. Consequently, the flare would probably not be useful in a traffic situation since it would have to be precisely aligned with oncoming traffic and would only be visible by the few drivers within this narrow beam of light. It is certainly not a good substitute for a real flare which is much brighter and omnidirectional. This little light is not as good as the emergency flashers built into vehicles.If you want a safety flare to carry in your vehicle, buy the real thing. If you want a light you can use as a map light without distracting a driver, or to see where you're walking without seriously degrading your night vision, this red light will do that well. it is working good, it arrived with their own protective cover and battery. i'm using it to quickly monitor somethings in the truck like temperature of the steering fluid in the reservoir (i though it was too hot, but after measuring, is not much hooter than the temperature in the transmission and well under the limits), and to check temperature in other components like pulleys, rotors, brake pads, etc. fun to use.yes, is an infrared thermometer, not an oral one, not a fluid thermometer, (like all the other infrared thermometer), so, don't use it in highly reflective areas or remove the reflective factor first, i.e, using a black tape or so on. (or expect to loss some degree of accuracy)

I haven't put this cover through difficult duty, and probably won't...it will stay in the carport most of the time. However, construction is good, the small vents on either side are pretty nice.Regarding fitment, the XL fits a BMW F800ST (with stock rear luggage rack) perfectly. This bike is about 90&#34; long, maybe a few inches longer with the rack. I used this to change the plugs in my F-150. You can get away with a extension and socket but this is the right size to not be to long or two short. It fits fine on my 2012 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab.  I bought this and the stabilizer bar to keep my cooler(s) from trashing my truck bed.So EZ even a cavemen can use it!Ok, he might have a few cuts while trying!! 
Sizes listed in reviews and the two in the description (15.8 x 10.5 x 5, and 12.5 x 9.5 x 7) don't match to what I received...The bag I received is in between what has been listed in the descriptions:  13.5" x 9" x 6" (empty).While seemingly a good quality bag, with a fair amount of straps and attached rain-cover (hidden in the heel of the bag), it seems the manufacturer (or seller) has no idea how to use a measuring tape!The bag itself is quite nice... good padding, rubberized bottom to prevent sliding, small pockets on either side, and zippers seem of reasonable quality.For the price and bag quality, I'm not complaining.  It works great on my CB750, and it does fit on the pillion of my VT1100c2 (without having to remove my rider backrest)  So if you have standard seating (or a touring/adventure style), this bag will do well for you as a pillion bag, and with a little strap adjustments, it also fits vertical on the front or back of a sissy-bar, or horizontal on a larger luggage rack... The meter has all the functions you could ask for a multimeter in a compact size.  The digits are large for the size of the meter, so it's easily readable by middle aged eyes. These item does fit perfect on my 2004 BMW x3. does what its suppose to do. so far so good thanks 
Red line ATF/ MTF for my 02 C5 Z06!!!now I can push my z06 knowing my tranny is good to go! OEM PART NO F6AZ-7A098-AWHY GO AFTERMARKET?  THIS IS THE BEST FOR FITMENT This item will help keep your battery on full charge,and ready to go all the time, when used properly. Use in conjunction with the extender cord,(will let you park farther from the wall plug). 
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. Fit my '98 Nissan Frontier's oil pan perfectly. Looks to be of nice quality.  Torque to 25ft/lbs (on the Frontier anyway)

A bottom fist strike seats cap. We will see soon how it handles a road trip. I tower out at 5'7&#34; which is not considered tall when it comes to working on or retrieving items from the bed of my 4x4 truck. This came in a nice carrying case that stores well behind the front seats in my truck without scratching anything. I have put on the front tire trying out the fit and it will work well .

I was hoping this tool to be good, but it has poor design. In my honest opinion, the tool is way too big/tall and heavy because 50% of the time I can't take a tread reading because the tool is too big to fit in between the tire and the upper wheel walls on most of the cars I work on. This thing weighs like 1/2 pound and that's just way too heavy for a tire tread gauge. It does feel rock solid sturdier though, but it too difficult to use because it's hard to quickly retract the measuring point in between taking readings. Does what its supose to and does it accurate...Well made and marked...Numbers print a lil small, I guess you can only wright sooo big on the lil barrel... Giddy-Up. I was suprised how well and how easy they worked even on an extended van.  It saves wear and tear on the shoulders. 
Great wheel lock that is easy to activate and unlock.  It comes with 3 keys, one of which has a LED light on it.  The product also comes with a reminder cord that attaches to the handle bar as a reminder.  It does just what I was looking for. First, you will need to buy the high tone also, or it will sound stupid. It is part #72102. I have put these pair on my last 4 cars. The low tone does have a habit of failing if it gets wet. This has happened twice to me. For some reason, the high tone works fine if it gets wet. Make sure you mount the low tone in a location where it will not get wet.The kit does not include a relay. You may want to install a relay, especially if your car is wired for one horn. The horns draw 4.5A each at 12V. This is usually within factory limits and most fuseboxes will have a 10A or larger relay built in the horn circuit. The kit does include 3 female blade connectors, a mounting bracket and nut, and a jumper wire (needed if your car is wired with one horn lead).And, they are very loud. Packaging declares 130db at 4 inches. I do not have a db meter, but I can assure you the horns will get the job done. The pair has a nice tone, and will rid your car of the little factory &#34;meep meep&#34; horns. I bought these horns to replace the weak sounding horn that Toyota puts in the Corolla, Matrix, Prius, Yaris, ect.. These horns are very load to say the least. The Hella box included one low tone horn and one high tone horn. It also included instructions and a single Bosch style relay.There is NO wiring of any kind included with this purchase (this is why I gave it a 4 star). I made my own wiring harness which included a 30 amp fusible link, and the included relay and a relay socket. The following link is to the picture of my install on my 2006 Toyota Matrix XR:[...]Make sure you use the included relay in your install. I know some people have just used the existing single horn wire (not using relay), but these new horns have a pretty heavy amp draw! The last thing you want to do is mess up your factory wiring because of some horns. Do it the right way, and follow the instructions! Your horns will also sound better.You can not beat the price and sound quality of these horns! They will get your attention, I can promise you that.  I do recommend these horns! 
Finish off the door area on the Jeep should come from the factory, however these are easy to install, nice looking and made with quality material. I purchased these items more for style than function.  They do look great, but are not made of high quality components.  The metal seems stamped, and the attachment screws look like wood screws instead of the original metal screws.  Easy to install.  I wish that they would have been offered in flat black. These are typical hard plastic handles, contoured for grip. The stock bar is substantial at 7/16". Edges are finished nicely. The metal shaft is unpolished and has a finish to prevent slippage.I don't care if all my hand tools are the same color, if it matters to you then note these may come in a different color than illustrate (see my pics).Made in the U.S.A. - nice.j 
Thought I'd find a use for this on both rear view mirrors, was mistaken.  Still the convex surface allows for a really good viewing angle at a really cheap price so I have no complaints. We have used FOUR different towing mirrors on two different trucks in the past year.These actually work...although my wife is bothered by the F-150 inset mirror on the truck itself, having the 3rd mirror is unnerving to her, but these are SO much better than the strap on mirror setup you see on other systems.These do fit on 2013 F-150 trucks (just don't get for the STX -- different mirrors). Not a bad mirror it's just a little on the large size for my side view mirror, but I'm getting used to it. 
We have an SUV. I would normally setup the side view mirrors so that when viewing the rear view mirrors and side view mirrors, there is just a bit of overlap when looking at them. This presents a problem when backing up as you cannot see the curbs clearly. So this helps a lot. The side mirrors are now just looking straight back helping in parallel parking as well backing up to a curb. These mirrors help in making sure that when you are driving and changing lanes, you can see if there is any object in your blindspot without glancing over your shoulders. Great mirrors and to this day, they remain clear. I will get another one - the smaller version of these mirrors - for my sedan. 1. The viewing surface of the 8 inch mirror is exactly 7.5 inches wide and 2.25 inches high.2. I tried adjustment of the mirror without mounting it. The ball joints on the mirror arm are so tight that adjusting is extremely difficult to nearly impossible.  WD40 did not work, neither did working the joints around to loosen them up.3. So if you try to adjust the mirror after it's mounted, you risk stressing the mounting button glue and the button may fall off.4. When adjusting the mirror, the day/night button kept flipping on/off.  Very annoying.5. The mirror surface itself is very good, no ripples. I drive a car that has dead spots on both sides.  This fits the bill as it provides a larger area of view.  You need to look more carefully as all these types of mirrors make the car in view seem a lot further away so use as a reference.  Since these mirrors are fairly small they only use up about 20% of the existing rear view mirrors viewing area.  I only use these on my rear view mirrors as that is when the blind viewing areas occur.  I usually purchase a few different types of these mirrors so I can determine which works best for me and my wife.  Also try on different spots of the existing mirror, before removing the adhesive covering, to determine the best location.  If you attach it in the wrong location these mirrors can be removed by using a one sides razor blade.  Just push down on the razor slowly to prevent the existing mirror from cracking.  Once off you can always purchase new double sided tape to reuse the convex mirror. 
I bought a pair of these to use while pulling a 17' Bowrider type boat behind a 2007 Ford Ranger.  With just the stock mirrors, any traffic directly behind the boat was absolutely invisible to me.  With the mirrors, that is no longer the case.I had two problems initially: one due to my own ineptness and the other due to being alone.  When I first got these out of the box and clipped them into the bottom of the door and the window groove, the horizontal bar was not horizontal at all.  Adjusting the straps straightened that out completely.  Also, the mirrors appeared to be fixed in position and any effort to move them seemed as if it might break them.  Well, there are three Phillips head screws that encircle the adjustment ball; loosen them and you can move the mirror any way you want.The major problem remains adjusting the passenger side mirror.  If I had somebody to move it for me, I could adjust it in just a minute while I sat in the driver's seat.  As it is, I had to get out, adjust the mirror, get back in, check the adjustment from the driver's seat and repeat ad nauseum until I finally got it right.  I don't fault the mirror for that.These mirrors come one to a box so you need to order two of them.  The image vibrates slightly but that doesn't really matter in practice:  I'm just looking to see if anything is behind the boat.  It will tell me that. I bought this, set the code by turning the screw inside the front of the unit, and sprayed with a silicone lubricant.After a month on the front bumper, in the WA rain, there's no sign of rust and the inside tray is dry.The thumb-wheels turn easily and front face plate is tight.I can't find fault with this and it seems pretty secure.Since I can't predict when and where I might lock myself out of the truck, I just leave this on the front receiver by CURT where it fit's just fine with the smallest gasket.I'm very happy with this purchase. Fits a little tight especially around the front fender and floorboards but it works.  I have a 03' Shadow ACE 750cc.  After a couple rain storms I can report my bike stayed dry (except a portion of the front wheel) and through heavy winds, the motorcycle cover stayed put.  What&#8217;s nice about this cover is the price and how it has elastic hooks to secure the cover in place.  If you decide to buy a cover and your bike has a windshield, floor boards and aftermarket mirrors I recommend you buy a 2XL (if your bike is similar in size to a Shadow 750cc).  Look at the picture I posted, mine has stock mirrors and no windshield and fits VERY tight.  My mirrors shift out of place when the cover is on.  Before each ride I have to adjust them cause the cover is soo tight.  Also, if you have floor boards that&#8217;ll make the fit even more tighter.  Buying one size bigger and I would say you bike will be 100% covered. 
with plastic bumpers being the norm, thought I'd use this plastic polish.  It brings the shine to the plastic painted areas just like step 2 does to the metal. Does a super job on brass, copper, silver, aluminum, bronze and stainless steel. Polishes most metals to a mirror-like finish. Very similar to Flitz polishing cream. Very quick and easy mounting and really adds to the look of the rear of the Jeep.  These are metal and not a cheap plastic and mount with included screws into the existing lens cover screw holes. 
Looks great, easy install, will help back passengers when top is down, since there is nothing to hold on too, low profile, does not get in the way of view. (Jeep Wrangler 2013 2 door) our 32' travel trailer w/ three slideouts has the factory electric stabilizer jacks at the front and back, which are great at stabilizing the ends.  But in between these, over the axles, we can feel the trailer flex and slightly bounce especially when we are entertaining & have folks congregate in the middle.  These work really well when placed just in front of the tires.  We simply crank them up snug against the frame rail on each side.  Now the trailer doesn't bounce or wiggle nearly at all.  Too bad RV manufacturers on long wheel base units don't add in a third stabilizer in the mid section to keep up/down flex movement of leaf springs & tires from causing bounce feeling. We also have the BAL X-jacks between the tires to prevent any roll effect from front to back. This device attaches securely to the tow vehicle, but at a cost.They are cumbersome to attach and detach, with several moving parts and the potential to scratch the tow vehicle paint during either process if you don't have three hands available.To attain the secure vibration free fit, you must crank down on the ratcheted web strap hard enough to deform the door where it attaches to the window channel. It also deforms the rubber window seal.Foam pads protect the door somewhat where the bracket would otherwise rub on the body, but if the area isn't meticulously clean beforehand I can see where it would dull the paint over time.Because of the metal claw part that fits into the window channel, raising and lowering the window caused a screeching sound on my driver's side window.Finally, when they are detached from the door, they make for a very bulky awkward device that doesn't store conveniently or compactly in the vehicle.I'm sending them back. 
They are levels for a camper  and in that respect they function well.  The fineness of the level's reading can mean little you don't take care during installation.  Jack it up or do whatever  you need to do to  level your camper.  I use a quality 2' or longer carpentry level  and  I use the inside floor to level from - width and length.  Jack the camper up or drive it up on blocks but get it as close to level as you can.  I install these levels on the rear in the center and right side  near center or forward.  They have sticky back tape on so they will hold in place but being never satisfied with sticky tape I screw them down. These work well for a budget level. They have double sided tape on the back and a couple of drill holes for security. The problem is that if you only use the tape they can move simply by grabbing them and wiggling them around. The onyl way to truly secure them is to drill holes. I did not want to drill holes in my RV in the event that I didn't like these or wanted to go with something else in the future.If you do get them I would buy a couple packs of them so that if they break or go bad you can put a new one in without chancing them being unavilable and potentially having to get something else that doesn't have the same screw hole pattern. I've put this on and axle upside down, it stays where I put it, and so do the bolts, washers, and nutes 
I've owned Jeep Wranglers for seven years now. I switched from a traditional cleaner-wax product because Jeep Wranglers have black plastic hard-tops (well, during the winter at least!), black plastic fender flares, black plastic mirror housings, and on the newer Wranglers, black plastic bumpers and door handles and assorted other trim. A traditional wax applied to any of those turns them white, but if you don't treat them with something, they fade to an ugly mottled gray over time. Thus the Turtle Wax Ice, which can be applied to everything -- hard top, fender flares, bumpers, and the Jeep itself. This allows me to make my whole Jeep shine without worrying about getting some white residue on things that aren't supposed to have white residue.Note that this cannot be used on glass, it just streaks. So to make your glass  and mirrors nice and shiny and keep them from fogging up easily in the winter, you'll still need a traditional wax, not a polymer-based product (note - do not apply to exterior front or back glass, just to interior glass and to the side windows!). The same is true for plastic windows on Jeep soft tops, a traditional wax will keep them from turning yellow and help keep them scratch-free, a polymer product like this will just make them streaky. And if you're looking at a deteriorated finish or one with baked in bugs and tar, use some other product first to recondition your finish, don't use this on a badly oxidized or bug-and-tar-spattered paint job. So this product (and other similar polymer products) is not a solution for all protective purposes, but it sure does work well where it does work. These are typical hard plastic handles, contoured for grip. The stock bar is substantial at 7/16". Edges are finished nicely. The metal shaft is unpolished and has a finish to prevent slippage.I don't care if all my hand tools are the same color, if it matters to you then note these may come in a different color than illustrate (see my pics).Made in the U.S.A. - nice.j These are some nice door guards. Just locate them carefully and stick them in position with the adhesive tape that's already there. they look good and are reasonably priced.

When adjusting the mirror, the day/night button kept flipping on/off.  Very annoying.5. The mirror surface itself is very good, no ripples. Easy to mount and adjust. Since each one is made identical (there is no right or left, you just mount the mirror differently), one has the tensioner lever right next to the mirror (drivers side in my case). That is not a problem if you place it back from your mirror. Good sturdy mount and no vibration. Once adjusted they are easy on and off. match my existing wheel chocks.  A little too big a radius on the curved side for my wheels, otherwise would be a 5-star. 
This is like the icing on the cake for finishing the plates.  I see a lot of nice cars with ugly dealer plate frames and rusted bolts....why why why??  Just remove the frame, get these caps and hide the ugly screws.  :)Make sure your screw heads are not the hex head as it will not fit inside the caps.  Smaller phillips head machine and tapping screws will fit no problem. My dealer had put a plate frame on my motorcycle when I bought it but it covered part of the info (numbers and State) which is not legal in NC. I liked the look and price of this one and bought it. And it looks nice and frames the plate without covering any of the info on the plate. I did have to use a snipper to cut off the top of two of the barbs to get the screws in but you can't tell. It bothers me when front license plate is screwed directly to the bumper.  Considering the cost of these mounting brackets, I wish manufacturers included them as standard equipment; it would show their attention to detail.When I found Cruiser Accessories 79150 Mounting Plate it seemed like a good value.  I especially liked multiple slots for mounting onto the bumper.  These slots provide a good number of mounting and adjustment options.  I used the upper two vertical slots because they were spaced exactly like the existing holes in my car's front bumper.Unfortunately, there was a couple of frustrating issues that spoiled the experience:1.  Four screws that are included with the plate are too long.  I saw them being long and I am glad I checked for this before installing the mounting plate onto the front bumper.  I used included four screws to attach the license plate and the Black Cruiser Accessories 20050 Classic Lite frame to the mounting plate - screws' sharp tips protruded 1/4" from the back of the mounting plate.  If I had installed the mounting plate onto the bumper first and then tried to attach the license plate with the included screws, I would have damaged the front bumper in two places (the bottom two holes ended up over an air intake slot on my car).  I expect all pieces included with the product to be carefully engineered for that product and working properly.  These screws, obviously, are of the wrong size.  The fact that I had to go to Home Depot to find properly fitting screws not only was frustrating, but also increased the overall cost.2.  The thin pieces of plastic at the top and bottom of the mounting plate are too flimsy.  When I unpacked the plate, these areas of the mounting plate were slightly deformed: bent inwards. Fortunately, the license plate covered the problem.When the mounting plate is installed, it looks nice, so I am not completely disappointed; however, I found a similar product from Bell at Autozone, and it was cheaper (though Bell's mounting plate had very long screws too).

Fit and finish are nice, and the steel base looks forged and not cast. The screw turns smoothly even if the handle is a bit sharpHowever the throat of this tool is not deep enough to get over what look liike normal sized wiper arms on my 2012 Jetta SportWagan. When placed on the arm the center of the threaded rod only reaches to the edge of the wiper arm stud. I got the tool to work but it involved leaving the wiper arm nut on the stud about 4 turns loose and placing a thick steel washer on top of the nut to make a flat surface for the puller stud to press against. 
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.  The pickle fork is the last resort for me, as it will damage the balljoint boot.I prefer to use the Snap On balljoint remover.  If that one cannot fit, then I will try this tool.  If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork. I haven't really used it yet for the reason intended, changing the oil in my jet ski.  So, I can't comment on how well it works.  The main reason for this review is to put it out there that it does not work with a 2000 Chevy Silverado.  The siphon tube does not fit thru the bottom of the dip stick tube.  It would be really nice if Mityvac had a published list of what vehicles it works with and what ones it does not.  I have my fingers crossed that it'll work with my jet ski, otherwise there will be a new/(un)used Mityvac on *****'slist.  Long story short, do your research to see if you can confirm or deny if it will work with your vehicle before you buy it.

This is a piece of junk.! The straps stretch, the plastic clips slip off while tightening, and the dam things fall off while driving. Try to get the type that slide over the existing mirror and have a plastic screw in the back to hold it on.  They do work well. The quality of this tool appears good. Fit and finish are nice, and the steel base looks forged and not cast.

I like this flexible funnel over others for two reasons:1) Length is excellent and makes it easy to access the filler hole.2) Bottom stopper lets me hang the item for storage without having to worry about excess fluid leaking everywhere.Unlike other funnels, you can't simply stick this in the hole and have it stand on its own due to the flexible tube. However, it does have a small hole in a plastic tab sticking out of the side of the rim which is perfect for threading a small hook or wire through and attaching it to the underside of the hood. All the benefits of a regular funnel with added flexibility and length - perfect. Works really well for lubricating car door hinges. The spray can design could be improved, the straw frequently comes out while in use and doesn't fit super tightly. Also, the tapered top of the can with a small cap means that the cap easily gets knocked off and thus the can is prone to leaks when being stored. 
They work just great for what I want.  I have two sets of them that I use on my travel trailer.  Will buy two more sets when the others that I use wear out. When I ordered this, I was guaranteed fitment on a Toyota 3S-FE engine. When it arrived, it was not the correct size. i left two stars because I did run out and buy the correct size from another store, however, I didnt want to have to do this when I had all the rest of my parts shipped in. I was simply delighted to FIND purple locktite. I needed the right product for set screws on rifle scopes. Purpose locktite is not to be had in local stores. Go for blue and you commit your set screws. I needed something that I could use with a small screw and remove if I needed to without stripping anything or resorting to heat guns. This is PERFECT. 
Tired of being charged WAY to much pretty much everywhere for a 5 min filter change? I got this for my 2008 prius and you can do the install yourself in under 5 min for almost nothing. Never pay $120 again at the dealer.Your CAF is located behind the glovebox. To get to it, you need to open your glovebox and let it sit open all the way. Empty out your glovebox. If you don't, you'll be cleaning up the contents of your glovebox from the floor when you're done replacing your CAF. Next step is to look on the right side and unhook the dampener. Next, squeeze the rear of the glovebox sides inwards to be able to let the glovebox swing all the way down.Looking inside, you'll see a tray with latches on both sides. Press those latches inwards and start sliding the tray out.When you put your new CAF into the tray, make sure you follow the arrow on the filter as the air is meant to flow through in one direction. The air flow is down. If you forget, the tray has an arrow on it also that says &#34;air flow&#34;.To finish the job, reverse the proceedures above. Slide the tray in, click into place, rotate the glovebox up and let it snap into place, replace the dampener bar, then close the glovebox. If you are underneath your car doing some work, or just doing some routine maintenance, you need a solid pair of stands and a good jack to safely lift your car.  I cannot believe how many people I have seen working on their car with a scissor jack that came as part of their vehicle maintenance pack.  If you value your life, you want to get yourself a nice sturdy pair of stands like these.  It takes no more than a minute to successfully jack up your car, align these jackstands up, and then lower the car back down onto them.  They are built VERY nicely and the capacity is more than enough for standard vehicles (I use them on my RX8).  The only thing I wish that it had was some sort of safety on the release.  Granted that when the weight of the car is on the stands it is near impossible to release the height, it would still be a nice bit of insurance. I do like this but you should be aware of the caveats.  It fits on my SUV and truck but is too large for my car wheel wells, and as another reviewer stated, it does not fit on all SUV's and trucks.Pros: It is easy to use, convenient, sturdy when it fits a vehicle.Cons: Time consuming to adjust the step (three positions, but you will likely choose one and leave it; it has 2 thumb screws and painted metal that fits tightly with holes being difficult to line up), the storage bag only fits it if it is left in the shipped position (lowest); it does not fit in the bag if you change the step to a different position. Therefore, if it is changed just leave it out of the bag, or take the time to change it back.If it was designed to change height with push buttons like for the tire width adjustment, and had a bag that fit in all positions it would get more stars. If this is not what you want to work with for a ~$30 investment, maybe a $19 Rubbermaid step-stool from Costco would be better and more easily positioned, like for washing your car where there is no wheel to anchor to. It is really only good in the 2 wheel positions, so it is mainly a window/wiper access and rear roof access device.UPDATE:  After trying to use it on both vehicles I find I do need to change the step position, which on this unit is difficult. So, due to too much hassle, I returned it.Thank you, again, Amazon for your Amazingly easy return policy, again making Amazon online shopping a trustworthy experience. 
This works great. It's sturdy and fit's nice and snug in a standard 5 gallon bucket. I will be ordering more of these in the future. Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. just  recived  these  prefect  fit would  tell any one in of these  to buy  these you  wont  besorry  you did 
You can pay outrageous prices for OEM filters, so I use OEM for the warranty period, then change over to Fram. Fram is a good filter at a value price. I buy all my car filters on Amazon and pay my mechanic only for labor. This is an OEM product for many Japanese vehicles.  Great price.  As a dealer, I can buy at a good price from the auto supply, this is a better price. I already had another version of this gauge, but didn't have the TBI adapter, which can cost around $25 for just that. So I bought this CP7838 on amazon so I could test the fuel pressure on my GM TBI truck and it works great! Paid the lowest price I could find any where on amazon and for a few bucks more that the TBI adapter cost I got the whole set! 
Very easy to install clean area place your guard down mark your ends and then remove tape and place very easy. Your wheels typically have a clearcoat, and this is sprayed on, then using a soft brush, you can get all the brake dust off, then rinse the wheel.  But you can ALSO spray the rest of your car with this.  Brake dust settles on the lower part of your car's front doors, so you can spray these along the bottom.  I use my hand (with a glove) to rub the liquid as I hose it down, and it cleans all of the dust and much of the road tar, meaning very little use of the abrasive clay that most detailers will resort to for tough spots.  This is a less aggressive alternative to clay, and should be in every car-lover's arsenal.Recommended! This glove is great it holds the shampoo and remove all the dirt from your car without scratch your paint 
Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. Looks and fits the same for a 2000 Toyota Sienna van. I ordered extra so I will not be without any at a later date. These worked for my 2005 jeep grand cherokee.  I like how these bulbs will replace any of the three rear lights. 
Almost nothing to it, mass wise, has an adhesive disc on the back approximately 1.5" across, slightly off-center.  The actual mirror part thought seems to be silvered plastic (no surprise), but arrived with what appears to be scuffing directly from the packaging itself.  As long as there isn't a light source in the reflection, it's barely noticeable, but it's there. First things first...any protection this offers is purely incidental. You are fastening a metal grid to a plastic lens. Duh. But from a style standpoint, it does dress up the tail light assembly. One bar does pass right in front of theback up light which does diminsh its function. Installation is very simple. Directions are clear. The item is a bit pricey but the quality is good and the paint job good. It is a simple way to dress up your ride. The Tender Jr. does not come with a cigarette adapter so I cut this in half to make two. I purchased 2 lighter plugs for a buck each from China&#8230; with free shipping&#8230; and they are working fine. These aren&#8217;t an exact match with the Tender cables but they fit together OK and are easy to determine polarity with the wire colors. You can also just use this as an extension cord for your Tender. The description states a length of 12-inches&#8230; but it&#8217;s actually 14-inches tip-to-tip on the connectors. Nice item for the price and it&#8217;s made in Mexico. 
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. These worked for my 2005 jeep grand cherokee.  I like how these bulbs will replace any of the three rear lights. Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!! 
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. I love Lynx products, these caps fit properly and do what they are supposed to do. I would buy again. just  recived  these  prefect  fit would  tell any one in of these  to buy  these you  wont  besorry  you did 
This oil is just right for the renewal of your filter and should be used instead of SAE 30 alone.  It adheres better and as packaged is much easier to apply than sticking it and the filter in a bag and mushing it around.  It also uses less oil and gives precise coverage.  Oil your filter and get better air flow and better particle removal at the same time.You might be able to keep uncle Phil away from when you are grilling if you waft a little bit of it his way on approach, too, but maybe you shouldn't do that. Great fit, no performance gain but better then purchasing disposable filters... This filter is cheaper over the long run that buying replacement paper filters.  You will also enjoy better filtering and more airflow with this unit. 
I cant attest to any power gains but I do like K&N's product line. I have a K&N filter in all of my vehicles. I only use K&N filters in my Altima. I cannot say if its better than another brand or does a better job than another but it works so.... Mobil 1 0w40 has always been one of the premier products from Mobil 1.  Mobil 1 0w40 is not "just," a another viscosity.  Mobil 1 0w40 European Car Formula is actually different from other viscosities of Mobil 1 in more ways than just its weight.I often will run oil analysis on oil that comes from my cars, or even on a new bottle of oil, just to see its composition.Mobil 1 0w40 has more additives in it than say one of the more common viscosities like 5w30.The reason being is that this 0w40 product is recommended or approved by many European manufacturers who have stringent standards.  Indeed, some of these manufacturers do not only require specific performance requirements for this oil, but will actually specify where the additives packages must be purchased from.  Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, and BMW are just some of the manufacturers who have approvals on this oil.Furthermore, all AMG vehicles and Porsches come from the factory with this very 0w40 Mobil 1.  It is even used in some racing vehicles around the world.Mobil 1 does not just meet specifications, but tends to exceed those specs.Some might argue that Mobil 1 has changed its formula a lot over the years.  However, one thing is clear.  Mobil 1 0w40 is a quality product, approved by some of the most stringent manufacturer specifications, and it is the same formula found around the world.Amazon has great opportunities to have this oil delivered to your door.  There are often rebates available on the product.It's a proven product.  Recommended. 
The K&N KN-171C Harley Davidson/Buell High Performance Oil Filter not only works for me it works for the birds (There is a Red Cardinal that likes to see her image in the reflection of the filter). I cant attest to any power gains but I do like K&N's product line. I have a K&N filter in all of my vehicles. Be sure to check with the Auto or Truck Manufacturer to find the correct SIZE of Oil Filter for your vehicle. Amazon's Parts Locator says that the Motorcraft  FL820S does not fit my 1995 Mercury Grand Marquis, 4.6 Litre V-8 engine. This is incorrect. The fact is that the Motorcraft FL820S is the FORD-recommended filter for my 1995 Mercury engine, and is recommended in almost every application of the Ford /Mercury/Lincoln 4.6 Litre engine size.The Motorcraft FL820S interchanges with the BOSCH 3410, the FRAM TG2, and the K&N; 2010.The Motorcraft FL820S  has over 50 pleats, high flow rate, silicone anti-drainback valve, and steel end caps.Amazon's current low price ($3.69) is an excellent value for a quality oil filter that's MADE IN USA !!My car is driven in heavy traffic, desert temperatures, mountain driving, and trans-desert trips from Phoenix to L.A.The standard FORD Motorcraft Filters performed just as well as the high-dollar types -- and filtered MUCH better than the K&N;, which has a very high flow rate (for racing), but the low 90% efficiency rating of the K&N; makes it a no-no for extended oil changes. I wouldn't run a K&N; oil filter for more than 3,000 miles -- you'd just be stirring up dirty oil and pumping it through the bearings !! :>(For my American V-8 engine, I have found the best value to be the Motorcraft FL820S Oil Filter and Mobil 1 5-W-20 Extended Life (Synthetic) engine oil. The quality of the oil filter allows for filter changing every 5,000 miles, and the engine oil is changed once-a-year, regardless of miles driven.For maximum oil life, be sure your PCV system is working properly -- Remove and wash out the PCV Valve with Carburetor  Cleaner, and check for collapsed and/or damaged PCV hoses. A leaking PCV system will suck un-filtered dirt right into your engine !!1995 Mercury Grand Marquis RS225 HP 4.6 Litre SOHC V-8Modified Air Box w/ K&N; Air FilterBosch Impeller Fuel PumpBosch 19 Lb.

I cant attest to any power gains but I do like K&N's product line. I have a K&N filter in all of my vehicles. No Harley dealer within a 90-minute drive so getting the K&N delivered a good price was very convenient for a needed oil change. My first K&N motorcycle filter, but I trust the brand (cycle and truck air filters).  I have a specialty HD filter wrench, but being able to install it with a socket wrench (17mm) is pretty cool. I use K&N; oil filters on all my vehicles.  This one fits my 2000 Honda S2000.  As I don't drive it much, I change the oil and filter annually, not on mileage.  Full synthetic oil and a quality K&N; filter are cheap insurance for a 9000 RPM motor.  Glad Amazon stocks them at a competitive price.  For the Honda, easiest access is underneath, and easiest removal tool is this:GearWrench 9032 1-Inch Combination Ratcheting Wrench. 
This can be used to clean so many things. When I cleaned my air filter and then rinsed it, I now have a very clean spot on my front sidewalk. I've used it with much success cleaning up old oil spills in the garage and cleaning window screens on the house. Highly recommended for the air filter cleaning but has many other uses as noted on the product label. What can I say? It is an ACDelco filter used on GM pickups. Used 'em for decades and so far no large animal carcasses or driftwood have blocked my injectors. Fuel is so clean these days that filter changes are rarely needed, but I maintain a fleet of 50 or so vehicles, so I stay prepared with a few of these. They work plumb good, though. I used this on my wifes 06 corolla I also have K&N filters in our motorcycles and my truck.  I've used this product for years to clean all sorts of reusable filters from foam to fabric.  Works great and I like that the cleaning solution is relatively un-offensive meaning that you can use it in the kitchen before rinsing the filter.  Good stuff, can't go wrong with K&N products. 
I use as directed and have suds for the entire time it takes to wash my car. It works well for removing the dirt and leaves a clean finish. it does a good job of cleaning easy to use make the car come clean and is easy to clean up ...in a crowded market of a commodity product.Does a very good job in loosening (if not completely removing) road grime and brake dust before rinsing and washing with a brush or cloth.Wheels: you gotta clean 'em if you're washing your car. This cleaner helps take some of the work of that job. 
This is my second one of these.  I have been using K&N products on my cars for about 10 years and this kit cleans them well.  I usually clean my filter every 25,000 miles or so.  The kit lasts about 3 or 4 cleanings. I have used these wipers for the last 2 years and love them.  Installed in about 10 seconds each with removal of the old ones.  The usually last a whole year so I think it is a good deal instead of buying sets of cheaper ones and changing twice a year This product greatly exceeded my expectations.  My headlights look brand new again.  What a wonderful product!This kit includes the following:1 pair of latex gloves2 pieces of fine sandpaperCleaning clothsPretreatmentCleaner / PolishShine Restorer / ProtectorWe own a 2002 Mitsubishi Lancer OZ Rally Edition. It has about 100k miles on it and it's in pretty good condition. However the headlights had become very cloudy and yellow over time. I have tried scrubbing them with various cleaning products and pressure washing and never saw any improvement. I had been considering purchasing a new set of headlights but I figured I would give this product a try first.The instructions were very simple and easy to follow.I started off by applying the Pretreatment to each lens and was amazed as the yellow grime melted off of the headlights.Then I used the fine 1500 grit sandpaper and wet sanded the front of the headlights and this seemed to remove anything that the first step didn't remove.Next I applied the Headlight Cleaner / Polish and after completion the headlights looked very clean but they just didn't have that new car shine.Finally I applied the Shine Restorer / Protector and instantly saw a huge difference. I ended up putting 4 coats on for the last step and I had to wait 5 minutes in between coats. The whole process took me about an hour total. I also noticed that I have enough product left to clean them again in the future. Each of the bottles is still about half full. I am out of sandpaper but I can get that at any hardware store.I took a before and after photo of my headlights compared the two and there is a huge difference. They looked pretty disgusting prior to using this product and now they look just about brand new. I would have had to spend several hundred dollars to get a new set of headlights. This product will give almost the same result for a very small fraction of the replacement price. It's well worth it in my opinion.  I highly recommedn this product. 
The original light controller quit working, and I was very happy to see that Amazon carried a replacement.  The original was not a Curt I should add, and I have no idea why it failed, but this quickly resolved the problem and next day shipping got it here quickly. I've been looking to purchase a new Jump pack for use in the shop and narrowed my selection down to either the Clore JNC660 or the Shumacker ProSeries DSR PSJ-2212The reviews were about equal on both so I decided to get the JNC660Well, I just received the JNC660 today and it is defective right out of the box.I plugged it in to charge and the amber led that is suppose to be lit does not indicate it is charging. The Green LED does not show it is fully charged either.I verified my power cord has power from the outlet; even switched to another cord.Disappointed; I guess companies no longer have QC on their products.UPDATE: Feb 04, 2014After realizing that Amazon will not accept returns on this item, I contacted Clore Automotive tech support and explained that I had received a defective jump pack. I reviewed with them the various items I had checked to confirm that it was indeed defective.After they confirmed that I had purchased it via Amazon, they shipped a new JNC660 to me along with a prepaid UPS label to return to them the defective unit. I had the replacement unit in 5 days after contacting them. The replacement unit works great.Clore Automotive gets 5 stars from me for making this disappointing defective unit right. I ordered one of these for my 2008 Saturn Vue. Package marked for 2008 Vue but item did not work. Contacted storefront who fullfilled order for Amazon and was referred to Curt mfg. to obtain return number. Then had to contact seller again. Got a refund but I purchased a replacement from a local dealer. Seller later reported a wrong item number was somehow in the package. 
I was hoping to use the clay bar to remove water spots on a new truck but the one provided with this Mequiar's kit was worthless for this purpose. The kit does include everything you need to apply the products in the kit which is a plus and probably the reason the kit is so popular. Very quick and easy mounting and really adds to the look of the rear of the Jeep.  These are metal and not a cheap plastic and mount with included screws into the existing lens cover screw holes. Installed on a 2006 Acura MDX and it was painless... worst part of the install was getting out the interior panel holders as I did not have the proper tool. 
This makes it SO easy to charge in conjunction with my battery tender.  So far it has fit all my vehicles batteries ( Acura integra, Toyota Tundra, Toyota Pickup ) I love this little charger. It comes with a set of leads that I permanantly mounted to my 2007 Kawasaki Vulcan 900 Classic and it makes charging so easy. I highly recommend this "smart" charger for anyone with battery charging needs. I recently bought a 2011 Hyundai Tucson loaded to the gills and was astonished at how impossibly wimpy the single note factory horn was.  Leather seats, nav, panoramic sunroof, bluetooth, backup camera, kick-*ss sound system with subwoofer and iPod integration, etc., all kinds of toys.  Yet the factory horn sounds almost as robust as the horn in the 1966 VW bus my family had when I was a kid.  "Meep meep."  Note I said the Hyundai horn was ALMOST as robust as the '66 VW.  I think the VW horn had a little more oomph.  What was Hyundai thinking??I found a Hyundai tech to swap the original Hyundai/Kia P.O.S. horn with this item and the results are awesome.  My first ever new-car mod and it worked out great. 
The size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous. The funnel is 10" long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6" long. It states that the funnel is 4" x 4" but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2-1/4" in diameter at the widest point.It would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless. This works exactly as you expect. If your gap is too small, you can just slightly tilt the entire gauge while measuring the gap, and the gap will extend some... that is, measure, push to extend, re-measure, and repeat until you have the right gap.You can also use the inside of the small ring area to expand the gap. This is where I think the tool could improve. The small edge of the wedge on the inner ring could be smaller. Once, I happened to tap my gap too small to fit on that wedge, and had some trouble getting the gap to open back up enough to again work on the gauge.All in all, though, this is a necessity in my motorcycle tool bag. Just opened my mail and a 3.5 inch long air hammer bit is what I measured. Not the 5.7 inch as the ad says on Amazon.com. Hope it still works out OK. I wanted longer one that would reach into the hollow van sliding door, as well as the hollow rear-side panel. It's a nickle coin size and flat on the impact end. I was looking for a arched shape, but this will do? 
It does what it's supposed to do and the price is right so I would recommend it if you need to use pop rivets. This product appears to include the cable. IT DOESN'T. It's just the mount which it does okay, but you'll have to buy the cable separately. I was hoping to use the clay bar to remove water spots on a new truck but the one provided with this Mequiar's kit was worthless for this purpose. The kit does include everything you need to apply the products in the kit which is a plus and probably the reason the kit is so popular. 
Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators.

Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. These item does fit perfect on my 2004 BMW x3. does what its suppose to do. so far so good thanks I purchased this to be able to attach a high-end hydraulic assisted bike rake on the back of my Jeeps (JKs) with the rear tire still on.  It fit perfectly and teamed with the Bolt Lock BLT7018448 5/8'' Receiver Lock (Keyed specifically for your line of vehicle) it can be kept in the Jeep and my daughter doesn't need anything but her car key.The extender is exactly as advertised, well made, fit perfectly and does eactly what it is inteded for. 
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. Exactly what was offered, fit nicely, no major prep work, won't fade or crack, adjusts perfectly, easy removal and fits under seat in truck They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. 
I bought 2 pair of the Camco 44622 RV Wheel Stop for my trailer and am very pleased with the easy install. Easy to install in 2003 grand cherokee.  I can now work under the hood and fix all the things the previous owner did not fix.  I am batman I bought two of these to use after I recently obtained personalized license plates for my vehicle. I wanted something that looked nice while protecting my plates from wear and tear.  They were easy to install and although they do not come with the necessary hardware that was okay as I purchased theCruiser Locking Fastenersto use. Overall I currently have no complaints and as long as the clear covers hold up well I am happy with this purchase. 
I should have gotten the Honda cap.  This fits OK, but the screws are not "captured" in the cap.  With the original cap,the screws cannot fall out.  Considering the position of the screws when mounting this, captured screws are an advantage. Very quick and easy mounting and really adds to the look of the rear of the Jeep.  These are metal and not a cheap plastic and mount with included screws into the existing lens cover screw holes. Easy to install. I used my own screws because of the material that I was mounting the bracket on. I had to tape one of the light adapter plugs as it was a loose fit in the bracket.

WHEN TO USE EPOXY CEMENTWhen you need a strong rigid workable (e.g. sandable and/or paintable surface) adhesive, particularly for use on metal or hard plastic, epoxy is usually the best choice.  Most epoxies dry with little running or shrinkage, and so are good for filling gaps.  The major drawback to epoxies is that they consist of two parts (resin and hardener) which must be mixed in small batches, and then applied with your own applicator (e.g., a toothpick or popsicle stick). Some are packaged in a dual-syringe--but that is not an adequate solution, because the components must still be manually mixed in order harden to maximum strength.WHEN TO USE JB-WELDJB-Weld is a very strong epoxy cement.  JB-Weld is the cement/glue of choice when joining metal parts or filling holes in metals.  Otherwise, ordinary epoxy cement or other types of cements/glues are usually better choices.  Some other reviewers have complained that the descriptive name "weld" is inappropriate---to some extent that's true.  JB Weld can do some jobs welding can't.  Conversely some simple welding jobs like joining two thin metal rods at right angles are difficult with JB Weld.HOW TO USE JB-WELDGeneral Principles: Although JB WELD makes an excellent filler---and can even be used to cast small parts, it is not remotely as strong as real metal used this way.  Whenever possible, use JB WELD as an adhesive---a very thin layer of JB WELD holding two pieces of metal together.  Always reinforce with metal pieces when possible.  For example, rather than building up a massive flange with JB Weld, you might be able to use scrap peice of metal to form most of the flange, held in place with JB Weld.  The greater the relative surface area of contact, the strong the bond will be.Surface Preparation:  As with any adhesive, the surface must be clean and rough.  Clean with a solvent (according to another reviewer, acetone is the best solvent for this purpose, but rubbing alcohol will work), roughen the surface, then clean with the solvent again.  Use a clean cloth for each application of solvent.  I generally use a small grinding wheel in a Dremel tool to roughen the surfaces.  You can also scratch the surface with a knife, or use coarse sandpaper, or both depending on the material.The solvent cleaning is for removing the LAST TRACES of oil from CLEAN surfaces.  If the parts are oily, even multiple cleanings with solvent may not be enough---you may redeposit oil from your cleaning cloth or as the solvent evaporates on the surface.  So, if you can detect any oil on any portion of the part, or if you have any doubt, clean it with a degreaser first.  If you do not have a commercial degreaser handy, a paste of laundry detergent and a stiff brush may do the trick.  Only when you are certain that there are no traces of oil is it time for the solvent cleaning(s).Joining Broken Parts: If you are joining broken parts, with a clean but irregular matching surfaces, limit the roughening to scratching with a wire brush or etching with an acid (but be sure to wash off all traces of the acid). Apply a THIN uniform layer of JB WELD, lightly clamp together hard enough to squeeze out any excess. Sometimes a thick rubber band is perfect. Often you can arrange pieces so that the weight of the top piece will hold the joint together until the JB Weld cures. Sometimes you can place a weight (such as a brick) on top to apply gentle pressure.  Do not remove the clamp or pressure until the JB Weld has cured completely.  After an hour or two, after the glue has set but is still soft, you can cut off any excess with a knife or razor---but if you don't need to cut the excess off, don't.  Often you can build-up the surfaces around a break for added strength.  Sometimes blue painters tape can be used to help hold pieces together while the glue sets, and/or to make a temporary stand to hold the pieces in the best orientation.ScotchBlue Painter's Tape for Multi-Surfaces 2090-.75A, 3/4 Inches by 60 Yards, 1 RollJoining Dissimilar Parts:  Minimize any gaps if possible, e.g., by sanding if possible so that the contact as perfect as possible.  If you will be filling substantial gaps, sometimes it is helpful to cover openings with blue painters tape to prevent the JB Weld from flowing away and leaving gaps.Joining Long Thin Parts (rods or sheets): Try to overlap if possible, or reinforce them with a similar overlapping peice of metal glued in place with JB Weld.  To join a 1/8" steel rod, to another 1/8" steel rod, forming a "T" (a common and easy welding job, almost impossible with just JB-Weld), cut two 1"-long "L's" from a heavy-paper clip, (or make L's from similar wire), and embed those with JB-Weld on opposite sides of the joint.  You can further strenthen the joint by wrapping fine steel wire around the rods holding the "L"s in place---before  covering it all with JB-Weld.  Be sure to thoroughly clean the rods and wires first (see below).  For small parts, or when wire wouldn't work well, unwaxed dental floss is remarkably strong, and can do an excellent job of reinforcing joints (when embeded in JB Weld). Ideally, apply the JB Weld, then wind the floss tightly into the soft JB Weld.Filling Holes:  Don't forget to prepare the surfaces as described above---even if you can only roughen the surfaces with an ice pick or awl.  JB Weld shrinks very little as it cures so fill the hole completely.  If it is possible to sand the surface when the JB Weld has hardened, then overfill the hole slightly.  Since JB Weld flows a little until it sets, the surface should be horizontal.  If not horizontal, you can apply the JB Weld and then cover the hole with blue painters tape until the JB Weld sets.  Depending on the job, it is often a better strategy to fill the gap as much as possible with a piece (or pieces) of metal embedded in JB Weld that a single mass of pure JB Weld.Reinforcing a leaking pipe:  Work JB Weld into a piece of fiberglass cloth or with a spatula, apply, and then add more JB Weld to any thin spots and to feather out the edges. You may have to apply several layers of the JB Weld-saturated fiberglass cloth. Sometimes wire cloth (window screening) can be used.Holes in car body panels etc:  If you can cover at least one side of the hole with a piece of sheet metal (held in place by JB Weld) that is a good strategy---the combination of pop-rivets and JB Weld often works especially well, even if you ultimately sand the heads of the pop rivets away.TEKTON 6555 Rivet Gun with 40-pc. RivetsMixing:  Follow the instructions.  A paper plate can be a good mixing surface; popsicle sticks are the best mixing tools.  Beware that you must use the same amount of resin and hardener, and they MUST be VERY thoroughly mixed.  Mix until you are certain that it is completely and thoroughly mixed, and then continue mixing for twice that time.  Seriously!!!Curing:  Follow the instructions, but wait longer than recommended: the longer you wait the stronger the bond.  A a day or two at 70 or 80 degrees is a reasonable MINIMUM.  Note that epoxies do not "dry"--there are no solvents to evaporate, instead a chemical reaction hardens the cement (a plastic resin).  Chemical reactions are proportional to temperature (the rule of thumb is that for each 10 degrees, the reaction speed doubles).  Using the rule of thumb, if it takes 1 day to cure at 80 degrees, then it takes 16 days to cure at 40 degrees, and that's only to minimally cured.  Okay, I know that waiting this long is not practical in many circumstances---you can probably get away with curing for 4 hours at 90 degrees (but don't go much higher than 90 degrees), and "take it easy" for a couple of days.WHEN TO USE OTHER EPOXIESFor materials other than metal, particularly for rigid plastics, other epoxies are usually better than JB Weld.  Some epoxies are clear, or white, or specialized for particular purposes.  For exampleCLEARBOND H-3S Clear Strong Epoxy Adhesive Syringe - .85ozWHEN TO USE QUICK-EPOXIESOrdinary (slow) epoxies (whether JB Weld or other epoxies) dry harder than quick epoxies and are generally the best choice.  Maximum strength is the whole point of epoxies--if you don't need maximum strength---you probably do not need epoxy.  Use quick epoxies when 1) the hardening speed is essential, 2) when the item cannot be supported in the required orientation while the epoxy sets (at least several hours), or 3) when you have to absolutely minimize flowage.  Super-glue is often a good alternative in such situations.WHEN TO USE OTHER CEMENTS OR GLUESWhile epoxies are ideal for a few specific uses (primarily when you need a rigid cement for metal or rigid plastic)--there are many situations when other types of glue are better choices.  Epoxies are generally NOT recommended for flexible surfaces, such as leather, wood, or flexible plastic, and generally do not adhere well to glass, etc.  While epoxies may work with porous surfaces (paper, wood, ceramics, etc.), other adhesives are usually better.White Glue: For most light-duty indoor household applications which do not have to be waterproof, ordinary household white glue is safe, cleanup is very easy, and in most cases repairs are redo-able if you make a mistake.  White glue shrinks a great deal as it dries, and so is not good for filling holes or large gaps.  For example:Elmer's All Multipurpose White Glue, 7 5/8 oz. (E379)Glue Stick: Think of glue sticks as thick white household glue in stick form.  Glue sticks are great with paper, but have few other applications.Avery Glue Stic, 0.26 oz, Pack of 6, (98095)Wood Glue: Carpenters's wood glue is essentially water-proof (when dry) white household glue.  It penetrates and strengthens the wood better than any other type of glue. It is safe, and cleanup is easy. If the joint breaks again (because the wood is weak), it can be re-glued. For example:Elmer's E701 Carpenter's Wood Glue 8-OunceGoop:  Goop will bond virtually any material, including leather, plastics, glass, and metal.  The bond is clear, VERY strong, waterproof, and hard but flexible.  Since Goop is clear, if a little extra oozes out, it is barely noticeable. I've used Goop to repair ceramic plant pots, water hoses, and shoes; to seal holes in air-mattresses, to close small holes in window screens, as plumbers paste in assembling plumbing parts, to  I also use it to seal rust spots on my dishwasher rack--the Goop it also makes a "cushioned" surface that will prevent scratches to dishes.  Goop is particular good for repairing damaged electrical cords.Amazing Goop All-Purpose Household Goop, 3.7-Ounce Tube #130012Silicon Glue: Silicon glue is best for glass, and when you want a truly flexible connection (for example, to absorb vibrations). It is a good alternative for Goop for general household use on glass, plastic, and metal when you do not need the maximum possible strength. It is safer than Goop, and cleanup is easier. Like Goop, silicon glue takes days to reach reasonable strength, weeks to reach maximum strength. For example:GE Silicone II Household Glue, 2.8 ozFabric Glue:Beacon Fabri-Tac Permanent Adhesive, 4-Ounceworks amazingly well on fabrics, saturating the surfaces enough to provide a very strong bond, but without soaking through.  Depending on the application, fabric glue can be better than sewing.  It remains very flexible, e.g., it would probably be great on leather or heavy vinyl (e.g., women's handbags, shoes, luggage, etc.)Super-Glue (Krazy Glue): Super-glue is very strong, rigid, and fast. In many ways it is similar to 2-minute epoxy---except that no mixing is required. Although very hard, super-glue is brittle, and so, is not recommended for flexible objects. Super-glue is hazardous in that it can easily glue fingers (etc.) together.  Previously, I used super-glue frequently on objects (e.g., jewelry) when a clear bond was required---however, Goop is better for such applications, safer, and more conveneient. Opened super-glue keeps poorly, even in tighly sealed glass containers---so I recommended packages of multiple very small tubes.BAZIC Super Glue, 3 grams 0.10 ounces, 6 Per PackLiquid Nails/Construction Adhesive:  When you need to permanently join a large amount of surface, of almost any kind, Construction Adhesive is usually ideal. If you need to join 2 2x4s to make a 4x4 Construction Adhesive is better than nails.  Most construction adhesives are slightly flexible, and so can even be used on leather (i.e., to repair a loose shoe sole), etc.  Construction adhesive may leave a stain on porous surfaces, and may stain-through thin surfaces.  For small projects, Goop is usually a better choice.Caulking Compound:  You can think of caulking compound as white household glue with alot of inert filler--to use when you need to fill holes.  As an adhesive, it is the weakest on this list, but is strong enough for many purposes when spread over a large surface, such as the back of a ceramic tile.  A few years ago, I made a brick column to support a mailbox.  Traditionally, I should have used mortar--which would have been very time consuming.  I could have used construction adhesive (albeit any excess that squeezed out would have been ugly)--but caulking compound was quick, cheap, looks good, and was more than adequate for the job. This is a good outer covering for a header wrap, however, it is not that pliable and will kink around tight bends. The glue in a few section of the tape did not stick very well. ...oil to water, this agent will solve any need you have to patch, bond, fix, fill, attach, mend, glue, fasten, stick, plus it is resilient to cold, heat, vibration and surfaces can be slick or porous.I used Ultra Black until this came out and.yes it does make great gaskets but that is only the biginning. I fixed tears in my kayak, patched up my.boots, bonded a toaster oven under counter...anyways, you should get the idea by now. 
Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars I put these in my '03 TJ Jeep Wrangler.  They fit perfect and work exactly as you'd expect they should.  I installed a set of 55w HIDs in them and the light output is tremendous. 
Does what it supposed to do,Fits most of my scooters.Does not fit a Honda Shadow 750's disc brake, because the disc is too wide.One star less, because the mechanism to mount the pouch to the handlebars is very weak, and impractical (I can't install it on handlebars of scooters because they have the handlebars covered with plastic, and can't install it on the handlebars of my motorcycle, because the hand grips and throttle are too wide, so it does not fit; the pouch also does not have a locking mechanism, so it's kind of moot to try to mount it somewhere).Otherwise, a great purchase! This product appears to include the cable. IT DOESN'T. It's just the mount which it does okay, but you'll have to buy the cable separately. Very quick and easy mounting and really adds to the look of the rear of the Jeep.  These are metal and not a cheap plastic and mount with included screws into the existing lens cover screw holes. 
Works great, nice to have a second cable, but the OBD end of the cable is angled.  In my case, this cable won't work on my Subaru Outback.  I would prefer the option of a straight OBD connector.  Note that the angle connector works on my other four cars (Mazda, Honda, Dodge). Works great. Fairly easy swap.

I like how these bulbs will replace any of the three rear lights. 
Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.  The pickle fork is the last resort for me, as it will damage the balljoint boot.I prefer to use the Snap On balljoint remover.  If that one cannot fit, then I will try this tool.  If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork. Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors.

Perfect fit on my 2012 Jeep Wrangler, have been a K&N fan for years and have them on all of my vehicles. Great product!!! No headache replacement for the GenII Toyota Prius. This includes model years 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009. My 2006 was a 20 second job.

it works, but my only gripe is that the hardener should be double the size, as it takes 2x the amount to properly cure this stuff in my experience, which makes the difference between dirt hard and rock hard. My last bottle of wax was Mothers California Gold. To be honest I can't tell any difference between that and the NuFinish either in applying it or the end result. Both are great. dropped right in and made a noticeable difference. Went from about 17 mpg to about 22 mpg highway. The plus is its also reusable. 
The K&N; 99-5050 Filter Service Kit is all you need to keep your K&N; patented High-Performance air filter clean and performing at maximum efficiency.I have used K&N; Air Filters in my personal vehicles and also in my off-road competition vehicles for over 30 years -- with excellent results and superior performance in every instance, including better fuel mileage.The K&N; Air Filters should be serviced at approximately 25,000 miles --- they actually work just as well when they "look dirty", and they must be REALLY NASTY before the efficiency drops off.Take your time with the "Squeeze-Bottle" kit, and do EXACTLY as instructed -- your reward will be a cleaner-running engine that delivers all the power and efficiency that was built into it !!K&N; filters are proudly "Made in the USA" -- and known around the world as the finest filters that can be had at ANY price !!Amazon's speedy delivery is the icing on the cake !! I've been a satisfied buyer and user of K&N; Products for decades, and for several reasons:1.- ALL K&N; Products are proudly made in the U.S.A., keeping American jobs right here !!2.- Builders, racers, and average motorists alike know that K&N;'s Oiled Gauze filtering media traps and holds the finest dirt particles while allowing a full flow of clean air to the engine.3.- The industry's only MILLION-MILE WARRANTY.4.- The initial cost SEEMS high, but being able to use the same filter again and again for several years makes the K&N; a bargain.5.- A white-glove inspection of the inside of the throttle body after 50,000 miles shows NO DIRT has gotten past the K&N; Oiled Gauze filtering medium.A careful cleaning and re-oiling every 50,000 miles with the K&N; "FilterCharger" Kit (available at Amazon) will keep your K&N;'s like-new  performance for years.There are 2 types of Filtercharger Kits -- a "Squeeze Bottle" and an "Aerosol Can". After using both types, I find that it's MUCH easier to do a perfect job AND keep things neat if I avoid the Aerosol Can and go with the easier-to-control Squeeze Bottle. It's IMPORTANT that we don't apply TOO MUCH of the sticky "oil" to the filter pleats.NOTE: The K&N; filters work best on Carburetted engines -- Modern Fuel-Injected engines have "MAF Sensors" that are VERY sensitive to air-borne contaminants, and if too much oil is applied at filter-servicing, the results will be a contaminated MAF sensor -- and the resulting lack of performance and fuel economy.I avoid the contamination problem by removing the MAF sensor and cleaning it thoroughly with "CRC Mass Air Flow Sensor Cleaner" -- available at Amazon -- Follow the directions on the can EXACTLY, and your engine will run smoother and you'll save gas, too !!If you are not prepared to properly care for your K&N; Air Filter, DON'T buy one !!! Use the factory equipment Motorcraft and change every 12,000 miles.Good Luck !! This is the review I did when these filters were sold in "packs of 2" There are some mistakes which i will highlight in brackets.These filters (PL20195) were bought as a replacement for the Toyota filters that are found on the 2.5L D-4D diesel engine in the Toyota Hilux pickup truck. They are of a very high quality as judged by the sealing gasket, the anti-drain back valve and its weight.Filter is being used with Mobil 1 Delvac 15W-40 (edit: it was actually 5W-40) Fully Synthetic engine oil and the engine noise has certainly reduced from its previous dino based lubricant.In my country, the Toyota dealership(TTTL) charges about US$28 for one filter; purchasing online and having the filters shipped cost me about US$13 for one.I highly recommend this filter as a high quality replacement that doesn't break the bank or if you plan to extend oil drain intervals.Now the technical stuff for people that want to know:PL20195 = PL20064 minus the pressure relief bypass valve (exactly the same dimensions)PL20195 is a longer version of the PL10241PL20064 is a longer version of the PL10028 (edit: the PL10028 doesn't have an antidrainback valve)The larger the filter usually means:1)that it takes longer for the oil pump to fill it.2)that there is more filter medium to trap more contaminants out of your oil3)that the oil will pass through the filter medium slower4)theoretically that a higher RPM will be required to activate the filter bypass valve (which means that you can rev your engine slightly higher without the oil bypassing the filter medium) - this really depends on the PSI that the pressure relief valve was designed with, but if a small filter and a larger filter have the same PSI value for the "relief" then this theory should hold true.Today the filter is currently being used with Shell Rimula R4 15W-40 for 8000Km oil change intervals 
I like this and the Mother's kit.It did a great job on one of my cars, clay bar is pretty small, therefore the 4/5 stars...Clay is pretty mild compared to the Mother's kit clay bar.The Meguiar's kit did come with a cleaner wax sample bottle...I have not used this sample yet, but from what i heard, is pretty effective in removing anything the "mild" Meguiars clay cannot remove.It comes with a nice microfiber cloth & a case for the clay.The bottle of detail spray was not enough...but since it was my 1st time using a clay kit, I assume I used too much?I highly recommend this kit on what you get, just wish the clay bars were as big as the Mothers kit, but since the Mothers did not come with a case or cleaner wax sample....I guess it depends on what you value more?Meguiars kit:smaller clay barsclaybar casedetail spraycleaner wax sample bottlebigger microfiber clothMothers Kit:larger clay bars (almost twice as much as the Megs kit)detail sprayslightly smaller microfiber clothAgain, i like both kits I got this Lexol Leather pH Cleaner Spray offline at a local auto parts store...and I am glad I did.I start cleaning my car and the first thing I notice is the citrus smell.  Suddenly half through cleaning the passenger front seat the sprayer broke.  At this point the white cleaning rag I was using was still white and given I had not cleaned the seats in months I just returned it.So I went online and after much research orderedGriot's Garage 11259 Leather Care Spray Kit.  Well, the Griot cleaner cleaned old grime of the leather seats I had cleaned with the Lexol cleaner a week earlier.I have used a variety of leather cleaners over the years and in my experience this one does absolutely nothing. Kit comes with literally everything you need to wash your car, and then some. I usually keep it relatively simple -(1) wash with soap and water(2) detail spray + claybar(3) waxThe only thing I bought in addition to this kit were these sponges (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GJ3FEC/ref=oh_details_o07_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1)Soap works great, and this is the same claybar I've used for years. Have yet to test out the ScratchX, and PlastX is actually recommended for clearing up foggy headlights! 
No Harley dealer within a 90-minute drive so getting the K&N delivered a good price was very convenient for a needed oil change. My first K&N motorcycle filter, but I trust the brand (cycle and truck air filters).  I have a specialty HD filter wrench, but being able to install it with a socket wrench (17mm) is pretty cool. Be sure to check with the Auto or Truck Manufacturer to find the correct SIZE of Oil Filter for your vehicle. Amazon's Parts Locator says that the Motorcraft  FL820S does not fit my 1995 Mercury Grand Marquis, 4.6 Litre V-8 engine. This is incorrect. The fact is that the Motorcraft FL820S is the FORD-recommended filter for my 1995 Mercury engine, and is recommended in almost every application of the Ford /Mercury/Lincoln 4.6 Litre engine size.The Motorcraft FL820S interchanges with the BOSCH 3410, the FRAM TG2, and the K&N; 2010.The Motorcraft FL820S  has over 50 pleats, high flow rate, silicone anti-drainback valve, and steel end caps.Amazon's current low price ($3.69) is an excellent value for a quality oil filter that's MADE IN USA !!My car is driven in heavy traffic, desert temperatures, mountain driving, and trans-desert trips from Phoenix to L.A.The standard FORD Motorcraft Filters performed just as well as the high-dollar types -- and filtered MUCH better than the K&N;, which has a very high flow rate (for racing), but the low 90% efficiency rating of the K&N; makes it a no-no for extended oil changes. I wouldn't run a K&N; oil filter for more than 3,000 miles -- you'd just be stirring up dirty oil and pumping it through the bearings !! :>(For my American V-8 engine, I have found the best value to be the Motorcraft FL820S Oil Filter and Mobil 1 5-W-20 Extended Life (Synthetic) engine oil. The quality of the oil filter allows for filter changing every 5,000 miles, and the engine oil is changed once-a-year, regardless of miles driven.For maximum oil life, be sure your PCV system is working properly -- Remove and wash out the PCV Valve with Carburetor  Cleaner, and check for collapsed and/or damaged PCV hoses. A leaking PCV system will suck un-filtered dirt right into your engine !!1995 Mercury Grand Marquis RS225 HP 4.6 Litre SOHC V-8Modified Air Box w/ K&N; Air FilterBosch Impeller Fuel PumpBosch 19 Lb.

Works like it is supposed to.  I don't know if I really prefer the squeeze bottle to the spray oil, as both work.  The advantage is supposed to be that you are able to know how much oil your filter requires and can measure it out of the bottle.  I've only used the kit once on the filter on my boat, which is the stock filter and I have no idea the amount of oil it is "supposed" to have, so I just applied it as instructed like you normally would.  Good price on Amazon for the kit! If you've ever had to change the oil in your Subaru, you know just how difficult the filter can be to remove with the exhaust manifold in the way. With this handy tool you just attach it to a 3/8&#34; extension and ratchet and you can say goodbye to burnt knuckles for good.The technicians here at the Subaru dealership I work at turned me on to these when I saw how easy they remove filters all day. I'm certain that this would work on a variety of other filter sizes as it expands to fit. Well worth the cash if you ask me. What can you say about an accessory to service a K&N air filter? This is exactly what you need to properly service your filter. I have only used it once before, but I just ordered a spare filter to swap out between cleanings so I will do it much more often now. Actually, if anyone knows of a generic brand filter service kit, please comment and let me know. 
This oil is just right for the renewal of your filter and should be used instead of SAE 30 alone.  It adheres better and as packaged is much easier to apply than sticking it and the filter in a bag and mushing it around.  It also uses less oil and gives precise coverage.  Oil your filter and get better air flow and better particle removal at the same time.You might be able to keep uncle Phil away from when you are grilling if you waft a little bit of it his way on approach, too, but maybe you shouldn't do that. Great fit, no performance gain but better then purchasing disposable filters... This filter is cheaper over the long run that buying replacement paper filters.  You will also enjoy better filtering and more airflow with this unit. 
I was hoping this tool to be good, but it has poor design. In my honest opinion, the tool is way too big/tall and heavy because 50% of the time I can't take a tread reading because the tool is too big to fit in between the tire and the upper wheel walls on most of the cars I work on. This thing weighs like 1/2 pound and that's just way too heavy for a tire tread gauge. It does feel rock solid sturdier though, but it too difficult to use because it's hard to quickly retract the measuring point in between taking readings. Does what its supose to and does it accurate...Well made and marked...Numbers print a lil small, I guess you can only wright sooo big on the lil barrel... Giddy-Up. I was suprised how well and how easy they worked even on an extended van.  It saves wear and tear on the shoulders. 
Great wheel lock that is easy to activate and unlock.  It comes with 3 keys, one of which has a LED light on it.  The product also comes with a reminder cord that attaches to the handle bar as a reminder.  It does just what I was looking for. First, you will need to buy the high tone also, or it will sound stupid. It is part #72102. I have put these pair on my last 4 cars. The low tone does have a habit of failing if it gets wet. This has happened twice to me. For some reason, the high tone works fine if it gets wet. Make sure you mount the low tone in a location where it will not get wet.The kit does not include a relay. You may want to install a relay, especially if your car is wired for one horn. The horns draw 4.5A each at 12V. This is usually within factory limits and most fuseboxes will have a 10A or larger relay built in the horn circuit. The kit does include 3 female blade connectors, a mounting bracket and nut, and a jumper wire (needed if your car is wired with one horn lead).And, they are very loud. Packaging declares 130db at 4 inches. I do not have a db meter, but I can assure you the horns will get the job done. The pair has a nice tone, and will rid your car of the little factory &#34;meep meep&#34; horns. I bought these horns to replace the weak sounding horn that Toyota puts in the Corolla, Matrix, Prius, Yaris, ect.. These horns are very load to say the least. The Hella box included one low tone horn and one high tone horn. It also included instructions and a single Bosch style relay.There is NO wiring of any kind included with this purchase (this is why I gave it a 4 star). I made my own wiring harness which included a 30 amp fusible link, and the included relay and a relay socket. The following link is to the picture of my install on my 2006 Toyota Matrix XR:[...]Make sure you use the included relay in your install. I know some people have just used the existing single horn wire (not using relay), but these new horns have a pretty heavy amp draw! The last thing you want to do is mess up your factory wiring because of some horns. Do it the right way, and follow the instructions! Your horns will also sound better.You can not beat the price and sound quality of these horns! They will get your attention, I can promise you that.  I do recommend these horns! 
Finish off the door area on the Jeep should come from the factory, however these are easy to install, nice looking and made with quality material. I purchased these items more for style than function.  They do look great, but are not made of high quality components.  The metal seems stamped, and the attachment screws look like wood screws instead of the original metal screws.  Easy to install.  I wish that they would have been offered in flat black. These are typical hard plastic handles, contoured for grip. The stock bar is substantial at 7/16". Edges are finished nicely. The metal shaft is unpolished and has a finish to prevent slippage.I don't care if all my hand tools are the same color, if it matters to you then note these may come in a different color than illustrate (see my pics).Made in the U.S.A. - nice.j 
Exaclty the same as the OEM filter I dug out of the glove box. This one was the exact same but so much cheaper. Exact same filter they sell at walmart or an auto parts store.  Save the money and buy online isntead of paying more dollars for local purchase. this is the same filter they sell at walmart and auto parts stores. Save your money and buy it here online. Works great! 
I drive a car that has dead spots on both sides.  This fits the bill as it provides a larger area of view.  You need to look more carefully as all these types of mirrors make the car in view seem a lot further away so use as a reference.  Since these mirrors are fairly small they only use up about 20% of the existing rear view mirrors viewing area.  I only use these on my rear view mirrors as that is when the blind viewing areas occur.  I usually purchase a few different types of these mirrors so I can determine which works best for me and my wife.  Also try on different spots of the existing mirror, before removing the adhesive covering, to determine the best location.  If you attach it in the wrong location these mirrors can be removed by using a one sides razor blade.  Just push down on the razor slowly to prevent the existing mirror from cracking.  Once off you can always purchase new double sided tape to reuse the convex mirror. We have an SUV. I would normally setup the side view mirrors so that when viewing the rear view mirrors and side view mirrors, there is just a bit of overlap when looking at them. This presents a problem when backing up as you cannot see the curbs clearly. So this helps a lot. The side mirrors are now just looking straight back helping in parallel parking as well backing up to a curb. These mirrors help in making sure that when you are driving and changing lanes, you can see if there is any object in your blindspot without glancing over your shoulders. Great mirrors and to this day, they remain clear. I will get another one - the smaller version of these mirrors - for my sedan. This device attaches securely to the tow vehicle, but at a cost.They are cumbersome to attach and detach, with several moving parts and the potential to scratch the tow vehicle paint during either process if you don't have three hands available.To attain the secure vibration free fit, you must crank down on the ratcheted web strap hard enough to deform the door where it attaches to the window channel. It also deforms the rubber window seal.Foam pads protect the door somewhat where the bracket would otherwise rub on the body, but if the area isn't meticulously clean beforehand I can see where it would dull the paint over time.Because of the metal claw part that fits into the window channel, raising and lowering the window caused a screeching sound on my driver's side window.Finally, when they are detached from the door, they make for a very bulky awkward device that doesn't store conveniently or compactly in the vehicle.I'm sending them back. 
Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!! My parent's SUV is five years old now and anything can go wrong with the battery.  Initially I never really wanted to buy a portable jumper because they were all too big and expensive and the small ones looked clumsy.  I stumbled upon this one and I knew just by looking at it that it would satisfy our needs.The JNC300XL is very sleek, it's small, and built like a tank.  It's heavy (about 10 pounds.)  I have the nice little trunk bag from [...] and this fits in there with their portable air compressor (very snug at that.)  One time we were at the airport and my dad left the lights on and we were stuck in the parking lot with a dead car in a creepy area.  Luckily for us, we were parked away from other cars and a nice person helped us out with a jump.  I don't think we might be as lucky next time.  When a situation like that arises, you wish you had something like this.  Again, I'm not for carrying a bulky jump starter because I don't like my trunk cluttered with stuff.  The JNC300XL is just the right size to carry in a medium-sized trunk bag. It just feels right when you hold it.I also like how it has a built in flashlight and you can use the 12 volt outlet to power a dead cell phone or some other 12 volt appliance.  The cables are nice and are 4AWG and the clamps are very sturdy.  Removing the clamps requires a little bit of force so keep that in mind if you are not as strong as you used to be or if you have arthritis.  Griot's Garage sells this same item for one hundred dollars under their name.  The only difference is they give you a lifetime warranty and their item is red in color.  I bought this from another online retailer for fifty-eight dollars plus shipping.  So do some shopping before you buy it.I'm glad I bought this item because even though you won't use it everyday, it is a lifesaver when you need it.  Also you can help your friends and neighbors out when they have battery problems as well.  It's a fair price and the quality is outstanding. It's hard to find quality items that last these days. I'm very satisfied with this purchase. I love this unit. Now I know in detail what's wrong with my car before I take it to the shop. This lessens the opportunity that the shop will try to upsell me on a service that I may not need. I also like the idea of being able to log the issues on my computer. I have used it on a 1993 Ford F150; 2001 Nissan Sentra; 3007 Lexus RX350 and a 2001 Cadi Deville 
I mounted this as an auxiliary transmission cooler in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 with the 4.0.  No issues.  Obviously, this was a custom installation.  But with a little research on the jeep forums, no problem. I have a 2008 Ford F150 FX4 that has most every option including the mirrors with the turn signal indicator lamps immediately below the side mirrors.  I researched these trailer mirrors and although every formal resource, including the one from Amazon and the manufacturer, said this was not the trailer mirror for my truck, I found one review that said they took a chance and they fit and worked fine.  I had the same experience, they worked fine.  There are cut-outs that allowed the turn signal lamps to fuction perfectly fine and the shape of the mirror was a perfect fit!! I have been a fan of the Rain X blades, The latitude are new to me as I have always used the standard ones.  These work even better, they fit perfectly on my Audi that uses some new style clip, i was suprised that Rain X provided the additional clip to fit this application. 
This is a well built wheel chock. It's made out of thick plastic. I accidentally ran it over with my car. And it held up perfectly! Nope did not keep out the bad guys as they tore it apart.  The steel coil, sold elsewhere, that is inserted into the filler tube does work and is cheap to boot. This is the only glass cleaner I use in my vehicles.  It is TINT SAFE and is the best at cleaning glass, inside and out.  Sprays on as a light foam, so it sticks to the glass without running. 
I've never tried an Anco wiper before, but with all the rain lately, not was a good time to give the brand a proper try.  The Contour was super easy to install, and snapped on with less work than any blade I've tried (Silblade, Michelin, etc.).  I replaced only the driver's side with Contours on two cars, and so was able to compare the performance directly.  In both cases, the Contours were far superior.  They hugged the glass and swept off liquid cleanly, and were essentially silent even when the glass was not very wet.  It was enough of a difference to make me want to replace the other blades as well, even though they are not very old.The one thing I have yet to test is long-term durability.  If there are any issues with this, I will update the review. The reviewers here who say to remove the black lens covering are not increasing their ability to see better, only increasing the glare to other drivers.  They are also breaking the seal  and allowing water intrusion to do so, for no benefit.The light pattern of these is not ideal but for the price is fine. Mount them properly, aim them properly, and use them in conditions that warrant their use and only then, and they are an effective product.But too many use automotive lighting incorrectly, thinking that a huge blast of light is allowing them to see better, when in all actuality all it is doing is constricting their pupil sizes, and vision, and blinding oncoming traffic.I hope cops start ticketing these fools who are using auxiliary lighting improperly, or retrofitting HID bulbs into halogen housings. It is hard to find the 11" wiper blades that are used in the rear of some SUV's, this was a great find and is working really well :-)  Now all my blades are Valeo and I have no complaints about them :-) 
work great for my John Deere X500 This sunshade is easy to use and folds up to a nice compact size that fits under my seat well. It's a quite large size so is made for an SUV or car that has a large windshield like my Toyota Prius. While it doesn't fit the Prius perfectly, it's the closest size to being perfect.At this price, I have no complaints with this and can recommend it. Fit my '98 Nissan Frontier's oil pan perfectly. Looks to be of nice quality.  Torque to 25ft/lbs (on the Frontier anyway) 
I did not receive what is shown in the picture.  It does not have the two round lids that turn on top, but rather a hinged lid held by two thumb screws.  Doesn't really matter, as it works just the same.  This is a nice cover, and I'm happy with it.  It looks better than the one it replaced. Great wheel lock that is easy to activate and unlock.  It comes with 3 keys, one of which has a LED light on it.  The product also comes with a reminder cord that attaches to the handle bar as a reminder.  It does just what I was looking for. Does what it says it does......looks great !

The Tender Jr. does not come with a cigarette adapter so I cut this in half to make two. I purchased 2 lighter plugs for a buck each from China&#8230; with free shipping&#8230; and they are working fine. These aren&#8217;t an exact match with the Tender cables but they fit together OK and are easy to determine polarity with the wire colors. You can also just use this as an extension cord for your Tender. The description states a length of 12-inches&#8230; but it&#8217;s actually 14-inches tip-to-tip on the connectors. Nice item for the price and it&#8217;s made in Mexico. Sizes listed in reviews and the two in the description (15.8 x 10.5 x 5, and 12.5 x 9.5 x 7) don't match to what I received...The bag I received is in between what has been listed in the descriptions:  13.5" x 9" x 6" (empty).While seemingly a good quality bag, with a fair amount of straps and attached rain-cover (hidden in the heel of the bag), it seems the manufacturer (or seller) has no idea how to use a measuring tape!The bag itself is quite nice... good padding, rubberized bottom to prevent sliding, small pockets on either side, and zippers seem of reasonable quality.For the price and bag quality, I'm not complaining.  It works great on my CB750, and it does fit on the pillion of my VT1100c2 (without having to remove my rider backrest)  So if you have standard seating (or a touring/adventure style), this bag will do well for you as a pillion bag, and with a little strap adjustments, it also fits vertical on the front or back of a sissy-bar, or horizontal on a larger luggage rack... The 2 x 2 Inch mirrors are a good fit for 2006 Honda Pilot. I had to order via Amazon since I couldn't find these anywhere - it appears local auto stores only carry the 3 x 3 inch size. These little blind spot mirrors are a must buy item - they cover the blind spots on either side of the vehicle very well. 
I have a automatic standby generator for my home and in northern Michigan the temps can really get extremely low, like way below 0 My generator has had trouble starting in these severe climates. the specs call for SAE 5-30 I use this SAE 0-20 and it has no problem firing up in these cold temps. This is one of the better battery chargers out there.  Why?  Because it is temperature compensated.  This is important if the battery will be exposed to variations in temperature, either hot or cold.  Other brands offer desulfation and remote temperature sensing, which is valuable, but this one can be found cheap, and gives good performance. This level indicator works great on cool days (65-80 degrees, outside).  I use it on the a-frame of my 34 foot trailer.  On hot days, the water inside the level expands to such a degree that the bubble is no longer present.  When I first experienced this, I thought all the liquid had leaked out.  The next morning, when it was cool outside, the bubble had miraculously reappeared!  As a result, I cannot depend on this level to keep my trailer level.  It might work if I had not permanently installed it on the A-frame (kept it cool until I needed to use it) but, being exposed to the hot Utah temperatures makes this level undependable. 
First, as with all of the Dupli-Color Metalcast paints, if you want the metalcast effect, you'll have to use the Dupli-Color Metalcast Ground Coat (MC100) on the surface before you apply the color or it will not come out right. The can says that it also comes out the same if you're painting directly onto chrome like surface but I have not tried this so I don't know. Now for this green. I'm more of a blue and purple guy for dark colors so only by my personal preference do I say that this green comes out just a tad light in color for me. Overall though, if you use the ground coat this comes out great with a nice metal sheen. I recommend this product. I love the multicolored packages of wipes.  These are high quality and last a long time.  My only negative is the inability to orders cloths of particular colors since I use a color coded system in detailing cars.  I really want more DARK GREEN clothes.  As I stain them, lose them and give some to friends...I will keep ordering them from Amazon. The tool is a quality item that is well constructed and looks like it will last a lifetime. I have absolutely no complaint with the quality or construction but did note that the tool I received did not match the picture that should not be allowed for online sellers. My handle was grey in color instead of the advertised red. This does not detract from the tool's performance but I do find it unusual that Lilse would choose a dull color such as grey instead of a bright color that stands out. The grey acts as a camouflage if you drop it or set it down in your engine compartment making it hard to see and fish out from behind your firewall especially in poor lighting. The tool was a lot bigger than what I was expecting but that was actually something I liked. This tool will not help with all electrical connectors on every make and model due to the many different designs but is a welcome addition to my tool chest. Would definitely buy again if needed but would select the easier to see red handled version if I had the choice. 
The size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous. The funnel is 10" long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6" long. It states that the funnel is 4" x 4" but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2-1/4" in diameter at the widest point.It would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless.

Nice item for the price and it&#8217;s made in Mexico. Need 2 for each side, works well for small pop up. Buy these over ones w/ rope and add your own rope, same choke. These already have the hole for rope. Dimensions given are inaccurate on these two, they are exactly the same size. 
ARB base plate, nice thick plastic, works great.  Essential part of your kit if you carry a Hi-Lift on your truck.

Nice item for the price and it&#8217;s made in Mexico. Easy to replace. It lacks Toyota instructions, but it is exactly like existing Toyota part with all wires colored the same way so it is very obvious how to connect those.The original part has a silicone rubber tube going all the way from top to bottom with wires running inside it. This part only provides a short length of tubing that, at best, would cover half of the length of wires on my car.I thing they should provide a &#34;telescoping&#34; tubing of two diameters with one going inside of the other while you are crimping wires and then extended to cover the full length of wires

The first thing you need to do with these levelers is scrape off the indoor double sided tape and replace the tape with the 3M heavy duty outdoor tape. If you do not do this and these levelers are on the outside of your trailer the original tape will fail and by by level. This unit works well.  I used the supplied foam mounting tape and overnight the unit fell off the wall.  I remounted it with 3M foam tape and it has not moved in several months.  I would not mount it over a vehicle using any type of mounting tape. These arrive as MOPAR original with alcohol pads to clean the area before you install with the double sided sticky tape.  Install takes just a few minutes.  Great product and 100% satisfied. 
Bought this because I wanted to measure the length of a specific body part of mine.  Unfortunately a ruler was too big to measure the length of it.  I needed something very small in order to figure out how long it is. These jack stands are pretty well made.  And very light.  They do the job and offer adequate height adjustment.  Only criticism is that the base is fairly small for its size and could get a little wobbly if the jack is extended to its maximum height.  I haven't had a problem yet, so this concern may be unwarranted.  I use these stands with hockey pucks for protection of my car's frame.  They fit nicely on top of the supports.  I would buy these again for sure. Fits on my Hi-Lift jack just fine. Does exactly what it is supposed to do.If you are using it on wheels that are deep make sure the straps are long enough to reach the spoke pattern. 
These things are rated 8,000lbs but that's for ( GVW ) so while it's correct technically in reality each item is rated by the label at 2,000lbs per each item and if you had 4 (they sell them in pairs), if you had 4 of them you could put 8,000lbs on them, technically and according to them.****I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO RELY ON USER REVIEWS TO GET THE INDIVIDUAL WEIGHT RATING!!!!***GVW is a very deceptive and dangerous way to market and label these products.  Consider this, on a truck, the majority of the weight is on the front two wheels while the rear wheels don't have as much weight - same is true on a front wheel vehicle.  This leads to situations where you could overextend the capacity of these products.I'd like a very clear rating: 2,000lbs, 4,000lbs, 6,000lbs for each stand or ramp on Amazon so that I know how much weight I can safely put on it similar to what is found on jacks....a jack is not labeled as 6,000lbs if it can lift a 6,000GVW vehicle, 6,000lbs means that the jack can lift 6,000lbs!After all, I'm planning to get under these things!!!!On items like this where someone's life very literally depends on the labeling ---  it would be really really really nice (and a legal requirement) that the specifications on Amazon very clearly stated both the operating weight, maximium weight, and crush (failure) weight per each ramp/stand versus this GVW rating which is deceptive and just plain dangerous.I have very literally found people working underneath 8,000lbs trucks without the wheels using jack stands sold as "2ton" when in reality each jack stand was only rated at 1ton or 2,000lbs.....their comment back, "this is a 2 ton stand and 8,000lbs GVW divided by 4 is 2,000lbs or 1ton, plenty of margin."  When in reality 6,000lbs are up front....3,000lb for each wheel  and each stand rated at only 2,000lbs....making their jack stand 150% overloaded! --- horrendously scary (all because marketing is so bad in this area).  Yes people should exercise care in using double protection and users should Always read their instructions and warning before putting their life on the line -- but for the love of God, there is a responsibility on the makers and marketers of these products to label them very clearly and in bold with the weight that EACH can hold and Amazon should post that weight for each item in BOLD Yellow or Orange wording with very clear warnings.Amazon and automotive sellers on Amazon need to get on the ball regarding the needs of auto ethusiasts and for the safety of the weekend mechanic who should not have to do complex math to figure out how much weight each item can hold!We REALLY need to get away from GVW, it's deceptive and dangerous!****I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO RELY ON USER REVIEWS TO GET THE INDIVIDUAL WEIGHT RATING!!!!*** I hate how everything costs more just because it's for the Disabled.  This same cup holder costs 5x more when specifically targeted to the disabled.  But here, it's a fraction of the cost and is the exact same thing!  I got this mounted to my chair with basic screws and mounting brackets from the hardware store and it only cost a couple dollars extra.  My only gripe is I wish the parts that fold out aren't spring loaded.  I thought that once I flipped down the bottom of the cup holder, the arms would automatically spring up into place, but they have to be manually opened and adjusted.  Not a big deal, unless you have limited manual dexterity, but adds an extra and needless step.  My only other gripe is that the Navy Blue is soooooo DARK that it looks BLACK!  Blue should be BLUE!  But overall, a great cup holder, especially for the price. The price was right and it was delivered on time, however, it was not as durable as I imagined and was a little smaller than it looked to be in the picture.  It was also a little flimsy when extended to it's supposed maximum size.  I would not buy it again as my vents are larger and this is just not adequate for the intended purpose.  However, if the vents were not as wide, it would be acceptable. 
Not only do they not fit, very thin and wonder how long they will last.  Also if you have batteries with the post and screw/nut the latter is not covered. Makes seal very slick and shiney should do a great job protecting the rubber seals, dont know how long it will last untill it has to be reapplied, but will let you know the mitt was made real good it will definately last a long time,makes it easier to wash my car won,t get as wet 
This is a little red flashlight, period.  Yes, the red light is bright, and yes, it blinks if you set it to do so.  But this would NEVER take the place of a real flare under any circumstances.DO NOT buy this to replace the flares you should carry in your car emergency kit!!!!Most flashlights have the light beam coming straight out of the end of the tube.  This one has the light coming off the side, like a beacon or lighthouse.  It can ONLY be viewed from straight on!  While a flare puts out intense light in all directions (like a sparkler) this little flashlight only puts out light in one direction - the direction you have faced the beam.  DO NOT BUY, except as a toy, or as a hiking signal light - I have given it two stars for it being at least that useful.Flare?  No way. These things give off a pretty wide pattern for being so small. they could be a tad bit brighter but they are a fog light which is exactly what i needed. Lights feel well made and sturdy. The wiring harness is very well made. Wire is of good quality and is fairly long however, the load wire that goes from the switch to the relay was not long enough and needed to be extended for my needs. The switch that comes with the kit is really nice and has an LED active light thats red when the lights are off and greeen when the lights are turned on, but i wont be using it.EDIT: CRAP! lights started to leak. seems like the weather stripping inside around the lens is way too big and doesnt seal right. took the lights off my front bumper and put them on my rear bumper to use as reverse lights since they didnt give me the light output desired. after almost of week of being on my rear bumper they filled up completely with water even worse than they did on my front bumper and one lens also cracked. going to contact the company or seller to see if i can get a replacement lens. READ ALL REVIEWS BEFORE PURCHASING. THESE LIGHTS ARE NOT THE GREATEST. Almost too bright, but I love it.  Maybe the 100 watt model would be better than these 130's if your eyes are sensitive to bright lights.  Exactly what my 2004 Dodge Ram needed because the factory headlights stink.  My brights were no brighter than my low beam, and my old 1985 Nissan had brighter brights, but these KC 130 watt driving lights solved that problem perfectly.  For not being the full, long range lights KC offers, they sure shine pretty far, plus spread the light out to the sides and up into the trees, a good long range / flood combination.  I mounted them to my push/brush guard.  Took about 3 hours to install because I like to route, hide, and secure the wires very well.  I connected the white switch / relay hot wire to my high beam (brights)wire on the drivers side, so they go on and off with my high / low switch, plus I have the master switch mounted (without the switch frame) near the dash to keep the KC lights off completely if I want.  Just make sure you dim your lights (turn off the KC's) before you see anyone ahead of you or you'll blind them and can get a ticket if on a public road.  First night I tried them a big 8 point ran across the road in front of me, then stopped and pretty much "tip toed" off the road as if he was totally blind and afraid to move.  So beware of animals freezing in front of you with these things.  I turned them off and honked so he could run away.  And no, I don't hunt that way.The wiring diagram on the outside of the box did not show the white power / relay wire, as if it was pre-wired into the main power wire, but luckily there was the white power / relay wire available to tap into my high beam wire.  The wiring diagram on the directions in the box was correct.  Some vehicles newer than 1999 may not allow tapping into the high beam wire because of the vehicle's computer that senses voltage changes, but it worked on mine.  Only thing I had to supply was a sheet metal screw to secure the relay.  I cut off about 5 feet of extra wire that went to the switch.  The length of wire to the lights was just right. 
These are a huge improvement over the original halogen bulbs in my car.  They are whiter, brighter, and shine farther than the yellowish originals.  It was definitely a noticable difference, and much needed for night driving in an area with a huge deer problem (S.E. Minn). We have used FOUR different towing mirrors on two different trucks in the past year.These actually work...although my wife is bothered by the F-150 inset mirror on the truck itself, having the 3rd mirror is unnerving to her, but these are SO much better than the strap on mirror setup you see on other systems.These do fit on 2013 F-150 trucks (just don't get for the STX -- different mirrors). Not a bad mirror it's just a little on the large size for my side view mirror, but I'm getting used to it. 
Fits well in my my cars 12 adapter. Display section swivels 180 degrees for convenient viewing.Large easy to read numbers and backlit LCD display.3 LED Warning lights have 2 modes:one mode for battery (motor off) andone mode for alternator (motoring running). Very useful since you don't need to know the actual voltages for a healthy battery or charging system.ACCURATE. I checked the voltage reading with a professional calibrated voltmeter and it was within 0.01 volts. (Surprised me it was that accurate)Note: the LCD backlight and 1 led is always on and are bright. This may distracting to some people driving at night.Very happy with this unit. I would buy it again and recommend it to a friend. I did not carefully read reviews before placed my order.  Few buyer pointed out the product feature has changed.  According ad photo, It suppose has green and red indicator lights but only comes with one single red light, green light feature is omitted.  Red light means AC power is on but no way to tell it is actually charging or not?  For only one red light version, you can pay less than half price from other seller for similar product at Amazon. Because of the chemicals used, the old fashioned pyrotechnic flares are hard to find.  You might find a 3 pack at the local auto store or order a 50 pack box from the distributor via truck shipment, but few mail order houses want to deal with the shipping requirements for the flammable goods and oxidizers.Enter the LED flare.  This product has one bright LED that when the button is pressed once, it flashes.  It's bright in one direction, but not nearly as bright as a burning flare.  The magnet is quite powerful - I figured it would be little more than a refrigerator magnet but it grabbed onto my car quite well.As a map light, it's not really usable since maps have colors used and this is monochromatic light.  Also the directional led and lens in front of it form a 1/2" x 3" strip of red light on paper with the second press of the light button.  The 3rd press turns it off.To ensure it's ready to use, I'd recommend storing the batteries externally.  Also remember to gain anyone's attention you'll need to aim it into their eyes.With just one red LED it's not that bright - I've seen much better 12V LED arrays on amazon that are placed into a reflector and spread left, straight on, and right for a much brighter, and wider beam.Because of the dim output, and lack of usability as a map light, plus trying to replace a 15 minute pyrotechnic flare that you can not look at due to the brightness with one red led I am giving the product just 3 stars.  It's pushing a 2 star product. 
Bought 4 of these to replace an old rusty set that was on my older camper.  I like the lug nuts on the end much better than the old style.  I was able to swap mine out by just removing the bolts and the old jacks and bolting this in the exact same place, no drilling was needed as the holes lined up perfectly for me. I love these entry guards, they gave my jeep TJ a renovated look at the entries, they were ware and scratched , now thy look like new. Easy to install and not problem closing the doors. 2011 JEEP WRANGLER SPORTIt took longer to find the tools and unpackage the guards than it tookto install them on the jeep. A couple of screws and with in five minutesi was back in business. they look great and might stop a limb from bustingthe tail light.  MIGHT. 
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Bought this for work... do a lot of Toyota, scion, lexus oil filters... works good. nice tight fit and hasent stripped anything yet... Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. 
A number of reviewers have commented that the accuracy of this gauge is 0.1 psi.  It isn't.  The accuracy spec is +- 0.5 psi +- 1% of the reading.  This means that the gauge could show anything between 34.1 to 35.9 for a tire actually filled to 35 psi.Long story short...don't believe that 1/10 digit number that's being displayed.  If there's a slight change in tire pressure, it'll show it, but the actual value can vary significantly from what's shown. This is one of the better battery chargers out there.  Why?  Because it is temperature compensated.  This is important if the battery will be exposed to variations in temperature, either hot or cold.  Other brands offer desulfation and remote temperature sensing, which is valuable, but this one can be found cheap, and gives good performance. I used a turkey baster with measure to take out 16 oz of my coolant then filled radiator back with Purple ice. after a test run around the neighborhood, i touched the coolant hoses and they were HOT, i had no thermometer with me but i check up on the temperature constanly after i do work on my Pathfinder, and the hoses were way hotter then normal. Now this might be counter productive thinking but it makes sense. By having the Coolant increase its temperature, that increase in temperature is going to be direct with the decrease in temperature in the engine block as the coolant's heat transfer ability increases. I have no numbers as of yet, but i know for a fact, this product works even if it might be for 10 or 15 degrees, and for such a low price, Purple Ice has my recomendation. 
It fits perfectly to my 2005 Honda Accord.Filter quality seems to be good. bought this for my 2004 honda crv.  fit perfectly and cleared the code.  easy to do just give the threads some wd40 They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. 
Installed in a 2005 Tacoma (even though nobody lists one for the 05) and fits perfectly. Perfect fit for rear window on my 2004 Ford Excursion Limited. Easy to install. No spotting seen or squeaking at all Exactly what was offered, fit nicely, no major prep work, won't fade or crack, adjusts perfectly, easy removal and fits under seat in truck 
I just purchased a 2012 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited and purchased the Rugged Ridge 13305.14 Black Windshield Pillar Rear Side Grab Handles for the back seat and the Rugged Ridge 13505.04 Ultimate Black Grab Handle for CJ Jeep and Wrangler 1955-2010 for the front seat, both of which compliment each other and fit nicely in my new Jeep.  I couldn't be happier with the look, style, quality and most importantly the strength of the handles.  I'm one step closer to off roading thanks to Rugged Ridge!!! It locks and unlocks well with a &#34;positive&#34; engagement feel when it is secure. Fits great for both my front bumper receiver and rear receiver on my 2005 Dodge Ram.  No complaints, and I'd definitely buy it again. I would install this on your Jeep as soon as you purchase the vehicle.  They're very easy to install and protect you from scratches that could lead to rust.  The guards fit perfectly on my 2011 Jeep Rubicon 2 door. 
I have a 2008 Ford F150 FX4 that has most every option including the mirrors with the turn signal indicator lamps immediately below the side mirrors.  I researched these trailer mirrors and although every formal resource, including the one from Amazon and the manufacturer, said this was not the trailer mirror for my truck, I found one review that said they took a chance and they fit and worked fine.  I had the same experience, they worked fine.  There are cut-outs that allowed the turn signal lamps to fuction perfectly fine and the shape of the mirror was a perfect fit!! This makes it SO easy to charge in conjunction with my battery tender.  So far it has fit all my vehicles batteries ( Acura integra, Toyota Tundra, Toyota Pickup ) These KC&#8217;s light up dark & lonely places with brilliant, far reaching, white light even better than I had imagined they would. Install was easy on my &#8217;11 JK using Smittybilt 7690 brackets. The switch works great & adjustment of the beams was easy & positive with a 14mm wrench for the horizontal & a 13mm socket & extension for the vertical. Antenna interference with the passenger side light was avoided by angling the antenna back behind the light. Nice product! 
Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. This fits not only the Ecotec, but newer VW TDI's with the canister filter.  Works great, relatively low profile and goes nicely on a 3/8&#34; drive.  I accidentally ordered three (fat fingered the cart), and sold one to a fellow VW driver and one to a guy with a GM. 
I've an Optima in my old Corvette that has now failed.  I've have read thru their warranty information.  It states that the battery must be returned to the selling dealer for warranty service.  It cannot be returned to Amazon for any reason.  Therefore my question is this:If the battery purchased thru amazon should require warranty service, how is this done and by whom? I have this wiper in my garage ready to install when my other wiper needs to be replaced.  I was a little disturbed that the box that the wiper came in was battered, but I examined the wiper and it looked ok.  I contacted Valeo about their warranty and was shocked to hear that I had to deal with the seller (Amazon) for warranty.  Amazon offers only thirty day returns and by the time I install the wiper, the thirty days will be up.  I think Valeo, a well known wiper blade manufacturer, should handle the warranty coverage on their products beyond the thirty days offered by Amazon.  I think Amazon agrees. I ordered one of these for my 2008 Saturn Vue. Package marked for 2008 Vue but item did not work. Contacted storefront who fullfilled order for Amazon and was referred to Curt mfg. to obtain return number. Then had to contact seller again. Got a refund but I purchased a replacement from a local dealer. Seller later reported a wrong item number was somehow in the package. 
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Inexpensive, yet works as good as the ones sold by Honda dealerships. Made true to specs and fits right into the slot on my Accord 2006.Will buy again. bought this for my 2004 honda crv.  fit perfectly and cleared the code.  easy to do just give the threads some wd40 
Don't buy this rear wiper for a 1st generation xB, it will NOT fit! Get OEM or a wiper from elsewhere! Perfect fit for rear wiper blade replacement on an 06 Equinox.  The opening for the J-Hook is big enough for you to slide the new wiper blade in without problems. Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlander 
As good as the factory original. Thanks for the tip from one of the other reviewers to drill a small hole in the top of the cap in order to attach the existing leash. (It doesn't come with one) The Tender Jr. does not come with a cigarette adapter so I cut this in half to make two. I purchased 2 lighter plugs for a buck each from China&#8230; with free shipping&#8230; and they are working fine. These aren&#8217;t an exact match with the Tender cables but they fit together OK and are easy to determine polarity with the wire colors. You can also just use this as an extension cord for your Tender. The description states a length of 12-inches&#8230; but it&#8217;s actually 14-inches tip-to-tip on the connectors. Nice item for the price and it&#8217;s made in Mexico. This tail bag easily attaches to the motor cycle. 4 straps with a loop on one end and a quick connect on the other.  Also there is one strap with quick connects on each end and all are adjustable length. good bag for the price.

For the price, an excellent wiper. Now, I did just put them on so it depends on how long they stay good for, but so far they work very well. Why did I choose Rain-X? Because they were heavily advertised during a lot of Formula 1 races back in the day and that kinda stuck with me.NOTE: A lot of people seem to wonder what size blades fit their vehicle. Either do a quick google search, check your owner manual, or just get a tape measure and measure the length of each blade on your car. Typically the driver side blade is a bit longer by an inch or two. We got the universal-type wiper blade rather than the blade with a connector designed especially for our car. That means that the connector looks a little conspicuous -- bulky and out of place -- compared to the one on the old blade. It's not a big problem, but when there is not much to differentiate different replacement wiper blades, it may be a reason to try to get a version designed for your specific car.These wiper blades were easy to attach, and so far work fine. The studies I have read say all wiper blades tend to last about the same amount of time. It's hard to say how long these will last, but so far, so good. The blade is good. The materials, construction, and water removal are all good. I tried the C-19-UB on the passenger side of my GS350 and it worked as well as the 24" factory one on the driver side. The Anco blade is molded with a spoiler, which makes it similar in appearance to the factory wiper of the GS350 which is the holder and the refill assembly. I rate the product 3 stars for the high cost not justified by any additional benefit over the factory blade refill.There two points I wanted to make are:1. Attention must be paid to letters -OE or -UB at the end of the blade model. I suggest using the Amazon fit guide at the top of the product page or visiting Anco website to find specific models that will fit your vehicle. I ordered -OE blades thinking -OE stood for Original Equipment. My family owns and previously owned Toyota/Lexus cars and I am only familiar with the "cane handle" type of a windshield wiper arm. Anco -OE blades will not fit this type of connector. Additionally, the Product Description says that the blade has an "OE-style spoiler", so it is even more confusing what OE in the model number refers to. Anyway, Toyota and Lexus have a "cane handle" type wiper arm and only blade models ending in -UB will fit this connector.2. I think these replacement blades are just too expensive. I usually buy wiper blade refills at the dealer for about ten dollars for two. These blades cost two to three times that (depending on the availability of a rebate). I tried a C-19-UB alongside with the factory 24" blade on my GS350 and I did not find Anco blade to clean the windshield any better than the factory blade does. On one of my previous cars, I tried Valeo 900 Ultimate blades (similar to Anco Contour). I had the same opinion that, although these replacement blades work well, they do not work better than factory refills, and their high cost makes them unappealing to me. I do not find that at 2-3 times the cost of factory refills, these blades work 2-3 times better. 
After 5 years the rear tail light bulb on my SUV went bad, I picked these up and went to replace them and found out that what my SUV came with from the factory was this exact same bulb.Replacement was a snap (2 screws and I was done).I will be frank.  I'm an avid lover of Amazon and its low prices. These were more expensive here on Amazon but if you want to avoid a trip to the automotive store or you don't have an automotive store these'll come to your door although the automotive store has the database that tells you what vehicle it fits (would be great if amazon had a similar database - hint hint).Bear in mind, these bulbs fit dozens of vehicles but you need to know the part number that you need before you order.  Also, installation difficulty also varies by vehicle.  I'm handy around vehicles and have tools so it was a pinch for me, but if you're not mechanically inclined you might just want to opt for having these replaced at a dealer.It's a five dollar job if you know what you're doing.LED CHOICES:A few things on LED lights out there.  LED lights have come a long way but by and large its hard to find an LED light that does the job these bulbs do although LEDs should last forever.  The other thing about LEDs is that they draw very little power and that can cause some problems in your vehicle.  Example, the way I knew my brake light (blinker light) was broken was that when I turned on the blinker it flashed really fast (flash flash flash flash vs flash pause flash pause flash pause)...because LEDs draw so little power, your car thinks you have a broken flash light so your blinkers could flash fast (alerting you that your blinker light is out)...some of the newer LED lights have a capacitor built in to prevent his behavior but bottom line, its hard to tell what you're getting.  I'll tell you, as soon as I find an LED light that is as bright as these bulbs, doesn't have the issues of fast flashing, and has bright lights - I will most definitely buy them primarily because LEDs should last longer than my car.  The other thing about LEDs is that they're expensive.  Bottom line, if you know what you're doing LEDs are a good option if you go find the right ones.  If you don't know your way around these newest products, go with these regular bulbsPREMIUM BULBS:In my experience they're a waste of money unless you're a car afficionado and are going for a particular look.BRIGHTNESS OF THESE BULBS:Since they were the exact same bulb that came with my car from the factory, the look is exactly the same.  Exactly the same light intensity - no more or less.  Fine by me, it's legal and bright enough.LONGEVITY OF THIS BULB:It took the set that came from the factory 5 years to burn out.  Since they're these same bulbs, I expect another 5 years from these. I had Hella Optilux 1002 fog light 2 years ago, that wasn't bright enough even i put the 35w HID in there, this time I'm going to use non-projector light for the fog light and use 50W HID in it!, this light come with the everything you need, durable cable, reply, switch, etc. for this price and its quality, i would say i found a good one, although the HID is bit hot especially I'm using the 50W, the chrome on Hella Optilux 1002 fog light stripped a bit on it because the hotness of HID. with the 50W HID 3000K on it, i can even use it as the driving light!!! sweet! with HID in there i needed to modify the hole in the back for the HID bulb to be fit, and use silicone to seal, that only need a small file and small silicone cost me only about $6.after a year of use this light with 50W HID in it. I like to use it a lot even in good weather, the light brights up the road.... but just recently one of the the lens broken but still works and the hosing still in good shape. I don't know what broke my len but I will leave it that way for a while! These lights will be the main lighting in my Teardrop Camper Trailer when I get back to work on it next spring. They look like good quality lights and the switch works perfectly on them. I connected one of them to 12v and they are nice and bright. The diffusers are great and do a good job of diffusing the light with no lines or shadows. These lights are very light weight, but that is not a concern as I am building my Teardrop as light as possible.If you are after LED lighting, these are also a good choice because you can easily upgrade the bulb to an LED Retrofit from most any Automotive supply store, Amazon, or Ebay. They have the direct replacement LEDs for RVs for most any fixture.You won't go wrong with these lights. 
The 3rd generation powerprobe includes a number of changes for additional flexibility.  In short, it is a vehicle powered DVM with both a 20 foot cable and an additional 20 foot extension giving you a 40 foot working range around either the battery terminals or cigarette lighter outlet, both clips and a plug are included in the kit.With the series 3 units they use a hard gold plated banana jack to hold the removable probe or cables to extend your reach.  If you purchase the accessory kit, it includes piercing probes that self center on a conductor, pierce the insulation, and attach to the jack allowing you to tap a wire at any point to locate intermittant problems.While the DVM is backlit all the time, it also has 2 bright white LEDs facing forward to aid in finding and probing terminals in dark places.  The actual probe is hardgold plated with a sharp tip and removable at the banana jack.  Another identical probe is included with a screw-in female banana jack in the accessories kit to retrofit the powerprobe I and II units to accept external cables and probes.If you need to excite a circuit with a connection to battery ground or to battery positive, the switch allows a momentary connection to bridge the probe tip to either voltage which is useful in testing relay driven circuits, indicator lights, and other small current loads.  The prope voltage is always displayed during testing on the meter. The voltage/ground switch is circuit breaker protected in case you accidentally drive 12 volts into a chassis ground.  Additionally, since the switch takes abuse it is easily replaced if it fails with just a screwdriver.Combined with the testlead set, the powerprobe 3 greatly simplifies testing of vehicular wire and big rigs up to a single trailer.  The DVM has 5 selectable modes of operation designed for different problems.  Reading the manual is important to get the full value from this meter.Although the price is a little high, the design and construction quality are excellent.  Enough wire is provided to check running lights on trailers or to look for blown fuses.  All of the wiring is exceptionally flexible and heavily insulated with top quality connectors.  Both the tester and accessories come in hard plastic cases that can be stowed in a service box.Not mentioned in specifications is that although the probe runs from 12-24 VDC, the meter can be used to measure voltages up to 80VDC. Well made. I like the quick disconnect harness that comes with this unit. Brings battery to full charge and switches to maintenance level. After reading the reviews and what each had to say about this disconnect switch, I purchased two. One for the engine battery and the other for the coach batteries in my RV.  The mounting bracket is "hefty". With the mounting hardware, it was a breeze installing these two switches. It is well worth the price just for the mounting bracket alone. Sturdy is the word I use for the switch. The only negative comment would be that I wish the key can be removed after engaging the switch. Yea, I know some would say it will keep you from forgetting the disconnect and take the key with you. I just prefer to have the ability to remove the key after the switch has been engaged.  Just me. 
I had two sets of jack stands but only 1 1/2 tin capacity and when I got my truck, I feel questionable getting under the truck. I know they share the weight but it only takes one to fail... So I ordered two pair of these 3 ton stands. They were securely packed in the box with cover and cushion. I love the double locking safety. Very good construction and ready for use. I highly recommend this product. Five stars for price and for doing exactly what it is supposed to do.  It also seems to be unbreakable in that it survived shipping.  Amazon didn't pack the box very well; I guess taking the manufacturer at its word and the claim that it is unbreakable.  I purchased two of these, both of which came in boxes that were utterly smashed up by heavier items in the box.  Both arrived unscathed anyway, although with one, the two halves had come apart.  It slid back together easily, so no big deal.I am using these on standard HVAC registers in our new house.  In two places we ended up needing to place furniture over top of a register.  We wanted something to direct the airflow out from under the furniture instead of blowing air into the bottom of it.  These do that well, and the magnets have held them in place.  Just slide the sides apart to the width you need and set them down.  Done.  I would recommend them, and will buy more if we rearrange things and need to cover other registers. Very good purchase for the money. Very good quality and worth what I paid. Like I said in the title, it's huge. I can get the zippers to about 2 inches apart with a 3X motocross helmet with the visor attached. If I take the visor off, it has plenty of room to spare. I don't think you could find a helmet without a visor that is too big for this bag.I use an &#34;AFX FX-17 size 3X&#34; sold here on Amazon, if you want to see what visor I'm talking about.I like that once my helmet, goggles and gloves are dry I can store them all in this bag. 
Does a super job on brass, copper, silver, aluminum, bronze and stainless steel. Polishes most metals to a mirror-like finish. Very similar to Flitz polishing cream. Truly an impressive assembly of 4 parts. If there is a finer example of a little piece of rubbery roll-y wheel attached to a wooden handle with some metal parts in the middle tying it all together, show me. with plastic bumpers being the norm, thought I'd use this plastic polish.  It brings the shine to the plastic painted areas just like step 2 does to the metal. 
This is a quick and easy upgrade from 55 watt lamps to these much brighter 130 watt bulbs. they are wall made and appear to be of higher quality than the Hella lamps that came with my fog lights. Does what it is designed to do and Amazon has great prices on them. But, if you are replacing yours on a ford f-250 with 5.4 go with 15718 with the longer cord. And a 2003 f250 w/5.4L only has 2 not 4 like it shows. 1996 to 1999 Chrysler/Dodge minivan owners have to live with weak headlight configurations. The overburdened single bulb provides both high and low beams in a poorly designed mirror/housing lens.Over years the plastic lens fog/pit from road debris along with the OEM bulbs yellowing.  Replacing the inexpensive (aftermarket +/-$40) lens housing is relatively easy for the DIYer.  Coupled with these Sylvania bulbs and one approaches the original brightness of showroom fresh headlight brightness.  But do not expect more. 
Ive always used screes, picks, pliers to get my cam seals out.  I dont know why i didnt buy one of these sooner. I have ordered this item many times and I will continue to do so as long as my bike continues to get me around.  For the price you can't pass it up and it comes in super fast after placing the order.  I normally get a few at a time just so they are here when I need them. I ordered 4 of these and they arrived just as described and in good condition.I always worry about ordering fluids online because I expect that it will be leaking when I get it but none of them leaked a drop.There's really not much to say about RP. If you're ordering this then you already know how good RP is. 
If you are going to order grab handles...buy these!  They are solid and look great! What else I like is they hang enough that they are easy to get your hand into to use them. Get these and stop bonkin the noggin. I used a stepladder to hold the liftgate while making the swap. It's a real mouse trap otherwise. These supports are exact replacement, fit perfect. If you lift the gate fully by hand you don't have to fight to make these things go on there. Simple, easy swap. I changed out my old NGK plain-jane plugs with these, and I'm very impressed.  My car runs extremely smoothly now, and it seems like it has more pick up.  The only thing you have to know about these are that you must gap them, and you can't use a traditional gap tool since you might break the electrode.  You need to use a fancy gap tool, or get creative and use something else to bend the metal away from the electrode without touching it.  I did the latter, and managed not to break the electrodes.  NGK's website has all the correct gaps for your make and model.  Go there and find yours.  Also, watch the NGK gapping video on Youtube.  It's worth it. 
works great, the cut outs are cut the way it is so you can put on your jack without having to take anything off to put this on. Take these saddle bags and the tail bag and your all set to go shopping,weekend away. One very nice feature is they don't dent or rust. You can easliy remove them anytime you want. Clever item. You can push all your refrigerator items back and hold them there while traveling. To lengthen, you have to unscrew the upper and bottom rod. Then you have to twist them while holding in place in the fridge to tighten them.

If there is a finer example of a little piece of rubbery roll-y wheel attached to a wooden handle with some metal parts in the middle tying it all together, show me. This drain works good but is starting to corrode. It really should be made from stainless steel or even plastic. 
to those who wish to know the truth regarding PIAA light bulbs.the PIAA light bulbs are no better than stock light bulbs.i purchased my 2004 toyota corolla brand new. the stock lights burned out in the year 2011.do the math, seven years without a stock light burn out.stock lights are just as good or better than the overpriced PIAA light bulbs.PIAA 10926 9006 (HB4) Intense White - 9006 51W=115W Xtra Intense White Bulb, Twin Pack If you are looking to upgrade from sealed beam headlights to replaceable bulb halogen types, this is the way to go. Far more light is transferred to the road and ahead than before and with the same wattage bulbs. This is a quick and easy upgrade from 55 watt lamps to these much brighter 130 watt bulbs. they are wall made and appear to be of higher quality than the Hella lamps that came with my fog lights.

I ordered -OE blades thinking -OE stood for Original Equipment. My family owns and previously owned Toyota/Lexus cars and I am only familiar with the "cane handle" type of a windshield wiper arm. Anco -OE blades will not fit this type of connector. Additionally, the Product Description says that the blade has an "OE-style spoiler", so it is even more confusing what OE in the model number refers to. Anyway, Toyota and Lexus have a "cane handle" type wiper arm and only blade models ending in -UB will fit this connector.2. I think these replacement blades are just too expensive. I usually buy wiper blade refills at the dealer for about ten dollars for two. These blades cost two to three times that (depending on the availability of a rebate). I tried a C-19-UB alongside with the factory 24" blade on my GS350 and I did not find Anco blade to clean the windshield any better than the factory blade does. On one of my previous cars, I tried Valeo 900 Ultimate blades (similar to Anco Contour). I had the same opinion that, although these replacement blades work well, they do not work better than factory refills, and their high cost makes them unappealing to me. I do not find that at 2-3 times the cost of factory refills, these blades work 2-3 times better. 
Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. This fits not only the Ecotec, but newer VW TDI's with the canister filter.  Works great, relatively low profile and goes nicely on a 3/8&#34; drive.  I accidentally ordered three (fat fingered the cart), and sold one to a fellow VW driver and one to a guy with a GM. 
I've an Optima in my old Corvette that has now failed.  I've have read thru their warranty information.  It states that the battery must be returned to the selling dealer for warranty service.  It cannot be returned to Amazon for any reason.  Therefore my question is this:If the battery purchased thru amazon should require warranty service, how is this done and by whom? I have this wiper in my garage ready to install when my other wiper needs to be replaced.  I was a little disturbed that the box that the wiper came in was battered, but I examined the wiper and it looked ok.  I contacted Valeo about their warranty and was shocked to hear that I had to deal with the seller (Amazon) for warranty.  Amazon offers only thirty day returns and by the time I install the wiper, the thirty days will be up.  I think Valeo, a well known wiper blade manufacturer, should handle the warranty coverage on their products beyond the thirty days offered by Amazon.  I think Amazon agrees. I ordered one of these for my 2008 Saturn Vue. Package marked for 2008 Vue but item did not work. Contacted storefront who fullfilled order for Amazon and was referred to Curt mfg. to obtain return number. Then had to contact seller again. Got a refund but I purchased a replacement from a local dealer. Seller later reported a wrong item number was somehow in the package. 
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Inexpensive, yet works as good as the ones sold by Honda dealerships. Made true to specs and fits right into the slot on my Accord 2006.Will buy again. bought this for my 2004 honda crv.  fit perfectly and cleared the code.  easy to do just give the threads some wd40 
Don't buy this rear wiper for a 1st generation xB, it will NOT fit! Get OEM or a wiper from elsewhere! Perfect fit for rear wiper blade replacement on an 06 Equinox.  The opening for the J-Hook is big enough for you to slide the new wiper blade in without problems. Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlander 
As good as the factory original. Thanks for the tip from one of the other reviewers to drill a small hole in the top of the cap in order to attach the existing leash. (It doesn't come with one) The Tender Jr. does not come with a cigarette adapter so I cut this in half to make two. I purchased 2 lighter plugs for a buck each from China&#8230; with free shipping&#8230; and they are working fine. These aren&#8217;t an exact match with the Tender cables but they fit together OK and are easy to determine polarity with the wire colors. You can also just use this as an extension cord for your Tender. The description states a length of 12-inches&#8230; but it&#8217;s actually 14-inches tip-to-tip on the connectors. Nice item for the price and it&#8217;s made in Mexico. This tail bag easily attaches to the motor cycle. 4 straps with a loop on one end and a quick connect on the other.  Also there is one strap with quick connects on each end and all are adjustable length. good bag for the price.

For the price, an excellent wiper. Now, I did just put them on so it depends on how long they stay good for, but so far they work very well. Why did I choose Rain-X? Because they were heavily advertised during a lot of Formula 1 races back in the day and that kinda stuck with me.NOTE: A lot of people seem to wonder what size blades fit their vehicle. Either do a quick google search, check your owner manual, or just get a tape measure and measure the length of each blade on your car. Typically the driver side blade is a bit longer by an inch or two. We got the universal-type wiper blade rather than the blade with a connector designed especially for our car. That means that the connector looks a little conspicuous -- bulky and out of place -- compared to the one on the old blade. It's not a big problem, but when there is not much to differentiate different replacement wiper blades, it may be a reason to try to get a version designed for your specific car.These wiper blades were easy to attach, and so far work fine. The studies I have read say all wiper blades tend to last about the same amount of time. It's hard to say how long these will last, but so far, so good. The blade is good. The materials, construction, and water removal are all good. I tried the C-19-UB on the passenger side of my GS350 and it worked as well as the 24" factory one on the driver side. The Anco blade is molded with a spoiler, which makes it similar in appearance to the factory wiper of the GS350 which is the holder and the refill assembly.

These things are awesome.  I bought two along with some relays and relay sockets so I could get them enough power directly from the battery to do serious audible damage.  Make sure to buy this one with its mate, the 72112 low tone.  After wiring in the relays, these went in my 2000 Civic perfectly.  They replaced the crappy horn in there, and I used the wiring to tie into the relay signal hot wire.  Then, I grounded the relay to the body by tying it into the ground wire from one of the horns.  The horns come with these little wire slide connectors that you can clamp onto your wires.  I used wire nuts to tie all the wires together - I suggest you do the same.  I was able to mount them facing away from eachother with grounding connectors in between the mounts using a single bolt that held the old Honda horn.  This was ideal, and very clean - no drilling required!I suggest finding yourself a 12V DC 4-pin or 5-pin 40 Amp SPST ISO Micro Relay for this project.  Also, it really helps to have a 5-Pin Wire Harness Relay Socket.  This will give you all the wires you need directly from the relay.  These are really cheap items, and you shouldn't have trouble finding them.  The 4-pin relays work fine with the 5-pin sockets.  Then, educate yourself on how relays work, and wire that bad boy up!  I got my relay and relay socket on ebay.Overall, I'm very pleased with this product.  Buy it now if you want to be heard on the highway. These things are awesome.

The installation of the SG2 is simple: attach the OBD2 connector to the DLC port and attach the RJ-45 jack to the SG2 unit. Routing the cable is really up to the operator. I chose to do it in a crude manner because I don't plan to make it a permanent addition to the car. I zip tied the cable to my HVAC vents and anchored it to the empty traction control hole behind the glove box.I used 1 of the provided velcro kits to affix the SG2 to the top of my steering column so that it is right below the instrument panel. It actually blocks my view of the shift indicator array, although I can still see it clearly if I lean forward.The update rate set at FAST is still rather slow and that is to be expected with the outdated OBD-II network. The "fastest" aftermarket scan tool that I have seen is SCT's Live Link for Ford / GM / Chryslers. If you want anything faster, you are going to have to borrow an OEM's scan tool system.The X-Gauge interface is a bit cumbersome since you are restricted to using 2 buttons to enter alphanumeric characters while if you pause for anything more than 10-15 seconds, the SG2 shuts down. According to Linear Logic, they are working on an updated SG2 with datalogging features so hopefully they incorporate a PC interface to speed up programming and setup times.I have it set to monitor instantaneous MPG, RPM, Vehicle Speed, and a gauge that I frequently switch depending on my mood. I am monitoring the torque converter slip ratio. Whenever it reads below 1.00, it means the torque converter is "slipping". Above 1.00 means the output side of the converter is spinning faster than the input side and theoretically it could just mean engine braking with some torque converter slip. You can program custom X-Gauges to monitor gross engine horsepower or torque input at the transmission.I had previously used a Garmin Forerunner 101 to check my GPS vehicle speed and compared it to my speedometer readout (2000 Ford Crown Vic with mechanical speedometer). It revealed that my GPS speed was about 2-3 mph slower than the speedometer indicated speed. The SG2's vehicle speed readout (from the Vehicle Speed Sensor PID in the OBD-2 system) is approximately 2-3 mph slower than the speedometer reading and I am assuming this is the same readout as my GPS (I didn't get a chance to verify this yet).Some of the gauges I like to monitor are Coolant Temperature, Intake Air Temperature, Transmission Fluid Temperature (XGauge), Torque Converter Slip Ratio (XGauge), Gross Horsepower (XGauge), RPM, Vehicle Speed, and MPG.I still haven't been able to figure out how to work the trip computer properly to display averaged fuel economy. The instantaneous MPG is more important to me because I want to see if anything is not working right on long cruises. I have often wondered if the torque converter was locking properly when I use cruise control or when cruising on the highway.The data collection stability is impressive. I never ran into many problems with Car Code or SCT's Live Link, but SG2 is just more convenient and compact. The backlight colors are interesting as they allow you to choose 4 different values of each RGB component (or 64 possible combinations). I have it set to R=3, B=0, G=0 so that it resembles Pontiac's interior lighting (I drive a Ford).My only real complaint is that there's not a better way of attaching the SG2 to the car. A suction cup mount for the windshield would come in handy since I could mount it near my line of sight without relying on adhesive-backed velcro. The interface is quite intuitive but I would have liked a way to program the X-gauge more easily, like via a PC interface.Bottom line: The SG2 is a great deal if you are interested in data readouts for your car. There are cheaper ways of pulling DTC codes, so the only real usefulness of SG2 is the "realtime" PID monitoring and the trip computer for cars that do not have such devices. If you know someone who is a bona fide gearhead and drives a car made in 1996 or newer, they may appreciate the SG2 as a gift.UPDATE:While the ScanGauge II provided a useful feature for cars without trip computers or onboard monitoring for various PIDs, I have noticed that it began to malfunction more frequently. The gauge readouts began to "flicker" between PIDs. For example, monitoring IGNition, the IGN began to switch rapidly between HPR. Just recently, the entire ScanGauge II shutdown while I was driving. It would refuse to reconnect with the OBD2 network. When it did find a connection, a lot of the text was garbled and it lost all of my trip data except for the total mileage. My car normally maxes out on 300 miles per tank of gasoline, so I was bewildered when the SG2 said I drove over 4000 miles. Other SG2 readers have reported similar quirks, albeit not as serious as the self shutdown and data corruption that I experienced.Many newer cars already have features built-into the car. The Pontiac G8, and Nissan GT-R are two examples of cars that have very developed "trip computers" while many other modern vehicles like the Pontiac G6, have trip computers that can monitor most of the fuel-related data. 
I purchased this product based on positive reviews by amazon.com customers to restore the rear trim on my 1998 Buick Riviera. While it makes a nice shine, Back to Black did NOT make the trim black again; it remains grey. I expected a more drastic improvement, like some of the tire shine products.In fact, I tried Black Magic &#34;Tire Wet&#34; on the rear trim, and it provides at least as good a shine as Back to Black.Bottom line : product is okay, but will not by any means restore black trim back to black This is great wax! It truly deserves the Gold Class name. I use this after the Meguiar's Ultimate Polish. I also have migrated to a 6 in buffer/polisher. I used to do all of my polishing and waxing by hand, and with the buffer, this turns out great. I have an 89 LeSabre that is Black Sapphire in color. Before using the polish/wax combo, it looked more like a darker blue. Nothing really deep. After polishing and waxing, it now looks like the black in black sapphire. It looks great in the shade, as it should and looks beautiful in the sun. There is a nice deep, glassy color, and I am pleased with the results. The water also beads very nice, too. Does a super job on brass, copper, silver, aluminum, bronze and stainless steel. Polishes most metals to a mirror-like finish. Very similar to Flitz polishing cream. 
After a power outage, I connected my refrigerator to this power supply. Sadly, its inverter was unable to support my refrigerator. The Duracell DPP-600HD doesn't have enough momentary  output to handle the initial start-up current spike of a refrigerator's compressor motor. The specifications say it can momentarily provide up to 960 watts. This equates to 8 amps at 120v.  Yet, public benchmark figures for a home refrigerator's start-up current indicate 13 amps for up to 1/2 second. Other appliances that use electric motors such as sump pumps are likely to exhibit the same characteristics. My suggestion is that customers immediately test this product with any device they intend to power during an outage.Some important specifications are missing in the Amazon listing.  One of the key statics is the capacity of the internal battery, which is 28 amp-hours at 12 v.  This equates to 336 watt hours.  Yet, AC output is much lower than this presumably due to inverter losses.  These losses increase with power output.  The following table illustrates this.  The last column is my calculation.load.................watts....hours....watt-hoursCordless telephone.....5........35.0 ...175Portable stereo.........10........22.0 ...220Laptop computer.......20........7.0 ....140Fan.......................100.........1.7....17036" TV...................133........1.2 ....1603/8 drill.................300........0.4 ....115Warm-air fan heater.312........0.4 ....109Blender..................385........0.3 ....109HID Floodlights.......400........0.3.....107Observe that the total energy delivered (watt-hour) drops with power consumption.  Ultimately, the usable energy is significantly less than what is contained within the lead acid battery.For reference, a refrigerator will use about 200 watts of electricity when the compressor is running. Typical consumers will have their refrigerator running about 50% to 60% of the time, which equates to an average of 100-120 watts being consumed continuously.ConsDoesn't handle current spikes associated with certain electric motorsProsBoth AC and DC outputPortableSimple operation Works as intended, easy to plug in and charge the motorcycle batteries.I double checked with volt meter at the end of charging and was at proper voltage I ordered 2 different chargers to maintain my gate opener's deep cycle battery (a simple 4 output charger with extension cords for charging other deep cycle batteries from amazonBattery Tender 022-0148-DL-WH 12V 4-Bank Battery Management System) and this unit has a far superior charging design.The 4 bank battery tender does a simple fast rate charge then switches to a trickle charge at a constant voltage with 4 outputs.This unit pulses the battery under charge and features 3 operating modes with different current outputs for different sized batteries. The selections are motorcycle which also works well for SLA gel cells or AGM batteries, standard automotive starting battery, deep cycle batttery, and off.What makes the CTEK unit special is that it uses a pulse charge in all modes to attempt to desulphate batteries, while the battery tender does not.  This method of charging has proven successful in restoring lead acid batteries that won't take a charge any more.It comes with a waterproof 12V output cable and a set of clips or rings for permanent installation under the hood of your car.  In addition to the LEDs for indicating the type of battery being charged, a second set is provided for empty, 1/2 full, and maintenance pulse charge mode.There is also a noticable increase in quality between the battery tender and this unit - small details like a water sealed housing and gaskets on the connectors indicate quality in manufacture.For a single 12V lead chemistry battery this is a useful, well made tool. 
I wanted upgrade the gear oil in my new Mustang GT and selected Royal Purple because of its reputation and durability. It is noteasy to distinguish between the 2 oils in the gears but I certainly noticed a difference using RP in my 6-speed transmission. I decided to try this product on the recommendation of a friend who repairs and rebuilds transmissions for a living.  The vehicles I used it in are a 2004 GM 5.3L V8 with 4L60E 4-spd and a 2001 Honda 2.0L I4 AWD auto 4-spd.  The ATF in both vehicles had less than 25k miles on it, so I did not flush the system before using this.  Instead, I drained the pans, added the recommended amount of Lubegard Red ATF Protectant, and then refilled the pan using Valvoline Maxlife ATF in the GM and Honda ATF Z1 in the Honda.The result has been transmissions that shift faster and smoother.  The Honda is also less &#34;jerky&#34; (it has always been pretty sensitive to throttle inputs).  I also noticed the Honda has a more positive torque converter lockup since adding Lubegard.I'm happy with the performance of this product so far and plan on continuing to use it. I have previously used in: 1980 Honda CX500C to fix a rough idle, 2000 Suzuki SV650 to stabilize fuel, and a 2005 Chevy Cobalt to fix a problem with stalling at idle. 
This four station battery tender is just as simple to use as the single units.  One simply plugs the unit in and connects the battery via alligator clips or a connection affixed to the battery. Its a simple task to tell what state the battery is in.  If amber the battery is deep charging, if green range it is 80 to 100% charged.  After the battery is charged, leaving in connected will put the unit in float mode, which will keep the battery "topped off" without damaging it.  My only concern is the housing is plastic and all of my single units are metal.  It does have mounting holes so it can be wall mounted or affixed more securely to a shelf, etc.  Like the single units, total time from opening the box to charging is about 2 minutes.By the way, instructions for deciphering the state of the amber and green lights are not in the instruction manual but on the right side of the unit.I also ordered the 12 foot extension cables, a good call if you need to have your batteries more than about four feet from the unit. This extension cable allows me to hook up my Battery Tender Plus to any vehicle in the garage.  The polarized end connectors maintain the proper polarity and that is important when charging batteries. This was used with the Battery Tender 800 on a lawn tractor and this cable is used to go from an outlet INSIDE the garage to the battery cable on the lawn tractor. 
My last same-sized container anti-seize, standing at attention, lasting me 30 years (home use), so my children will finish this one.About it:It's silver in color, 8-oz. container (a bunch), -65F - 1600F, Anti-Seize, -Corrosion and -Galling; has Lid Brush; label indicates "Made in USA".Specific Use: Ease assembly and disassembly of hardware which experience extreme temperatures and/or corrosive conditions.I've used this routinely, and sparingly for it does not take much - just a light swipe on threads, mating surfaces etc.  Most of my last container went to lubricating boat and boat engine components for very good saltwater corrosion prevention.A general caution is: not apply to business end of sparkplug, O2 sensor etc (lightly on threads/sealing surface only) - else could impact component performance (never seen it happen lol).*UPDATE: I visited Permatex website - wished I'd done so earlier ... A summary:From Website Technical Data Sheets (TDS),This Permatex (80078) has ingredients of "aluminum, copper and graphite lubricants ... meets or exceed requirements of Mil Spec Mil-A-907E."Temperature Range: "-51F to 1600F"Flash: ">350F"TDS Applications: "Sparkplug threads, Exhaust & Engine Hardware, Brake Assemblies, Boilers, Ovens, Jet Engines and Turbines.", and does refer to a "Marine" use.Permatex Copper:  This may be a preferred product due to seemingly inherent do-all capability: Dielectric grease, anti-seize, anti-corrosion to include mating surfaces of dissimilar metals. Specific from TDS, " ... designed for stainless ... contains a high percentage of micro-fine copper flakes in a semi-synthetic, grease carrier and fortified with high quality rust and corrosion inhibitors ... provides good electrical conductivity ... meets Mil Spec A-907."Temperature Range: "-30F to 1800F"Flash: "300F"TDS Applications: "Sparkplug threads installed into aluminum heads, Exhaust & Engine hardware, Oxygen sensors, Knock sensors, Thermostat housing bolts, Fuel filter fittings, Battery cable connections."Permatex Nickel: Specific from TDS, "Nickel Anti-Seize was designed specifically for use on stainless steel or similar alloys ... use where copper contamination must be avoided, under conditions of extreme pressure and temperature and with stainless steel, titanium and nickel alloys ... contains tenacious metals, oils and graphite materials that cannot be burned away or removed by slow moving parts." Product description also refers "protection of mated dissimilar metals."Temperature Range:  "-65F to 2400F"Flash: "200F"TDS Applications: "Exhaust & Catalytic converter assemblies."Kyle This product, Chevron Techron fuel system cleaner, and CRC Guaranteed-to-Pass fuel system cleaner are the only products that have been proven with results to work.  Redline makes incredible products, especially their transmission fluid. This is a must have tool for people who work on their own cars.  It seems the oxygen sensor is one of the more common failures that cause check engine codes to appear on the OBDII (engine and emissions control) computer system. 
Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. This fits not only the Ecotec, but newer VW TDI's with the canister filter.  Works great, relatively low profile and goes nicely on a 3/8&#34; drive.  I accidentally ordered three (fat fingered the cart), and sold one to a fellow VW driver and one to a guy with a GM. 
I've an Optima in my old Corvette that has now failed.  I've have read thru their warranty information.  It states that the battery must be returned to the selling dealer for warranty service.  It cannot be returned to Amazon for any reason.  Therefore my question is this:If the battery purchased thru amazon should require warranty service, how is this done and by whom? I have this wiper in my garage ready to install when my other wiper needs to be replaced.  I was a little disturbed that the box that the wiper came in was battered, but I examined the wiper and it looked ok.  I contacted Valeo about their warranty and was shocked to hear that I had to deal with the seller (Amazon) for warranty.  Amazon offers only thirty day returns and by the time I install the wiper, the thirty days will be up.  I think Valeo, a well known wiper blade manufacturer, should handle the warranty coverage on their products beyond the thirty days offered by Amazon.  I think Amazon agrees. I ordered one of these for my 2008 Saturn Vue. Package marked for 2008 Vue but item did not work. Contacted storefront who fullfilled order for Amazon and was referred to Curt mfg. to obtain return number. Then had to contact seller again. Got a refund but I purchased a replacement from a local dealer. Seller later reported a wrong item number was somehow in the package. 
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Inexpensive, yet works as good as the ones sold by Honda dealerships. Made true to specs and fits right into the slot on my Accord 2006.Will buy again. bought this for my 2004 honda crv.  fit perfectly and cleared the code.  easy to do just give the threads some wd40 
Don't buy this rear wiper for a 1st generation xB, it will NOT fit! Get OEM or a wiper from elsewhere! Perfect fit for rear wiper blade replacement on an 06 Equinox.  The opening for the J-Hook is big enough for you to slide the new wiper blade in without problems. Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlander 
As good as the factory original. Thanks for the tip from one of the other reviewers to drill a small hole in the top of the cap in order to attach the existing leash. (It doesn't come with one) The Tender Jr. does not come with a cigarette adapter so I cut this in half to make two. I purchased 2 lighter plugs for a buck each from China&#8230; with free shipping&#8230; and they are working fine. These aren&#8217;t an exact match with the Tender cables but they fit together OK and are easy to determine polarity with the wire colors. You can also just use this as an extension cord for your Tender. The description states a length of 12-inches&#8230; but it&#8217;s actually 14-inches tip-to-tip on the connectors. Nice item for the price and it&#8217;s made in Mexico. This tail bag easily attaches to the motor cycle. 4 straps with a loop on one end and a quick connect on the other.  Also there is one strap with quick connects on each end and all are adjustable length. good bag for the price.

Get OEM or a wiper from elsewhere! These worked for my 2005 jeep grand cherokee.  I like how these bulbs will replace any of the three rear lights. 
For the price, an excellent wiper. Now, I did just put them on so it depends on how long they stay good for, but so far they work very well. Why did I choose Rain-X? Because they were heavily advertised during a lot of Formula 1 races back in the day and that kinda stuck with me.NOTE: A lot of people seem to wonder what size blades fit their vehicle. Either do a quick google search, check your owner manual, or just get a tape measure and measure the length of each blade on your car. Typically the driver side blade is a bit longer by an inch or two. We got the universal-type wiper blade rather than the blade with a connector designed especially for our car. That means that the connector looks a little conspicuous -- bulky and out of place -- compared to the one on the old blade. It's not a big problem, but when there is not much to differentiate different replacement wiper blades, it may be a reason to try to get a version designed for your specific car.These wiper blades were easy to attach, and so far work fine. The studies I have read say all wiper blades tend to last about the same amount of time. It's hard to say how long these will last, but so far, so good. The blade is good. The materials, construction, and water removal are all good. I tried the C-19-UB on the passenger side of my GS350 and it worked as well as the 24" factory one on the driver side. The Anco blade is molded with a spoiler, which makes it similar in appearance to the factory wiper of the GS350 which is the holder and the refill assembly. I rate the product 3 stars for the high cost not justified by any additional benefit over the factory blade refill.There two points I wanted to make are:1. Attention must be paid to letters -OE or -UB at the end of the blade model. I suggest using the Amazon fit guide at the top of the product page or visiting Anco website to find specific models that will fit your vehicle. I ordered -OE blades thinking -OE stood for Original Equipment. My family owns and previously owned Toyota/Lexus cars and I am only familiar with the "cane handle" type of a windshield wiper arm. Anco -OE blades will not fit this type of connector. Additionally, the Product Description says that the blade has an "OE-style spoiler", so it is even more confusing what OE in the model number refers to. Anyway, Toyota and Lexus have a "cane handle" type wiper arm and only blade models ending in -UB will fit this connector.2. I think these replacement blades are just too expensive. I usually buy wiper blade refills at the dealer for about ten dollars for two. These blades cost two to three times that (depending on the availability of a rebate). I tried a C-19-UB alongside with the factory 24" blade on my GS350 and I did not find Anco blade to clean the windshield any better than the factory blade does. On one of my previous cars, I tried Valeo 900 Ultimate blades (similar to Anco Contour). I had the same opinion that, although these replacement blades work well, they do not work better than factory refills, and their high cost makes them unappealing to me. I do not find that at 2-3 times the cost of factory refills, these blades work 2-3 times better.

Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlander Don't buy this rear wiper for a 1st generation xB, it will NOT fit! Get OEM or a wiper from elsewhere! These worked for my 2005 jeep grand cherokee.  I like how these bulbs will replace any of the three rear lights. 
For the price, an excellent wiper. Now, I did just put them on so it depends on how long they stay good for, but so far they work very well. Why did I choose Rain-X? Because they were heavily advertised during a lot of Formula 1 races back in the day and that kinda stuck with me.NOTE: A lot of people seem to wonder what size blades fit their vehicle. Either do a quick google search, check your owner manual, or just get a tape measure and measure the length of each blade on your car. Typically the driver side blade is a bit longer by an inch or two. We got the universal-type wiper blade rather than the blade with a connector designed especially for our car. That means that the connector looks a little conspicuous -- bulky and out of place -- compared to the one on the old blade. It's not a big problem, but when there is not much to differentiate different replacement wiper blades, it may be a reason to try to get a version designed for your specific car.These wiper blades were easy to attach, and so far work fine. The studies I have read say all wiper blades tend to last about the same amount of time. It's hard to say how long these will last, but so far, so good. The blade is good. The materials, construction, and water removal are all good. I tried the C-19-UB on the passenger side of my GS350 and it worked as well as the 24" factory one on the driver side. The Anco blade is molded with a spoiler, which makes it similar in appearance to the factory wiper of the GS350 which is the holder and the refill assembly. I rate the product 3 stars for the high cost not justified by any additional benefit over the factory blade refill.There two points I wanted to make are:1. Attention must be paid to letters -OE or -UB at the end of the blade model. I suggest using the Amazon fit guide at the top of the product page or visiting Anco website to find specific models that will fit your vehicle. I ordered -OE blades thinking -OE stood for Original Equipment. My family owns and previously owned Toyota/Lexus cars and I am only familiar with the "cane handle" type of a windshield wiper arm. Anco -OE blades will not fit this type of connector. Additionally, the Product Description says that the blade has an "OE-style spoiler", so it is even more confusing what OE in the model number refers to. Anyway, Toyota and Lexus have a "cane handle" type wiper arm and only blade models ending in -UB will fit this connector.2. I think these replacement blades are just too expensive. I usually buy wiper blade refills at the dealer for about ten dollars for two. These blades cost two to three times that (depending on the availability of a rebate). I tried a C-19-UB alongside with the factory 24" blade on my GS350 and I did not find Anco blade to clean the windshield any better than the factory blade does. On one of my previous cars, I tried Valeo 900 Ultimate blades (similar to Anco Contour). I had the same opinion that, although these replacement blades work well, they do not work better than factory refills, and their high cost makes them unappealing to me. I do not find that at 2-3 times the cost of factory refills, these blades work 2-3 times better. 
The install is easy, just level your camper using a carpenter level of 3 feet or longer.  Set the level from side-to-side on your smooth flooring or counter top. Then set the level from front-to-back the same way on the smooth flooring or counter top.  Now position the Hopkins 08525 levels, one on the side you prefer to work from at the front of the camper, on a flat vertical surface.  Do the same on a side wall near the front corner on a smooth vertical surface.  Use the double stick tape to position, but consider adding pop rivets or small screws to hold the setting for many years.  Holes are provided in the Hopkins levels.Use the front level first to drive onto leveling ramps or boards, then use the side level along with the tongue jack to finish (after you unhitch). Extend your stabilizer jacks and you're set for level comfortable sleeping in your camper. The quality of this tool appears good. Fit and finish are nice, and the steel base looks forged and not cast. The screw turns smoothly even if the handle is a bit sharpHowever the throat of this tool is not deep enough to get over what look liike normal sized wiper arms on my 2012 Jetta SportWagan. When placed on the arm the center of the threaded rod only reaches to the edge of the wiper arm stud. I got the tool to work but it involved leaving the wiper arm nut on the stud about 4 turns loose and placing a thick steel washer on top of the nut to make a flat surface for the puller stud to press against. This seems to be one of the better levelers. There are two different scales on these levels. One is for the side-to-side (back of the coach) and the other is for the front-to-back (side of the coach). The reason there are different scales are they are more-or-less calibrated in inches.For example, it is simple Trigonometry to determine how many inches the coach is out of level simply by using the formula for right-angles and solve for one side. The input values are the angle (determined by the level) and distance from the level to the point at where you want to know how many inches of lift are needed.For the side-to-side level, the 1&#34; markings are pretty accurate as long as you put the scale in the center of the coach, as most coaches are within an inch or two of width from another.  However, for the front-to-back level, even though you put the scale in the center, the result will vary wildly due to the length of the coach. Using this level on a 18ft coach will result in a far different measurement than say a 35ft coach.Also, if you don't put the level in the center (in the side or back), then the two ends of the coach will be different. For example, if the level is in the center, then when the level measures 1&#34; off level, that means 1&#34; on either front or back. But if you put the level off-center, then the level reading 1&#34; might truly be 1/2&#34; on one end, and 1 1/2&#34; on the other. Again, it is simply a principle of Right Angles in Trigonometry.Also, do not rely on the self-adhesive backing as over time it can move. As hard as it may be for you to do, drilling a couple holes and inserting screws into the levels is the best bet. 
Summer heat car cool get for car it be good make A/C work better no more sad hot dash or hot wheel yay. Use with mitten and warm to hot water following a good high pressure hose down. Let it sit a minute on surface then wipe with soapy mitten. Hose off. I use very warm to hot water with very little of this concentrated soap. Always wash when your car surface is as cool as you can get it in the warm months. I have shade which works best but not essential. I used a turkey baster with measure to take out 16 oz of my coolant then filled radiator back with Purple ice. after a test run around the neighborhood, i touched the coolant hoses and they were HOT, i had no thermometer with me but i check up on the temperature constanly after i do work on my Pathfinder, and the hoses were way hotter then normal. Now this might be counter productive thinking but it makes sense. By having the Coolant increase its temperature, that increase in temperature is going to be direct with the decrease in temperature in the engine block as the coolant's heat transfer ability increases. I have no numbers as of yet, but i know for a fact, this product works even if it might be for 10 or 15 degrees, and for such a low price, Purple Ice has my recomendation. 
Perfect fit for rear window on my 2004 Ford Excursion Limited. Easy to install. No spotting seen or squeaking at all Received within 3 days. Saw Mythbusters do a test of these LifeHammers and they worked quite well cutting through the seatbealt and any of the windows EXCEPT the WINDSHIELD. Commit that to memory! In a emergency situation it will not easily crack or break the windshield, side and rear glass only. Mine is getting mounted in clear sight and access from the front seat, right in the middle of the rear seat benches so as to be easily grabbed by all! I have had experience with a stuck seat belt and they are a bitch to cut through with a semi-sharp pockt knife. I would install this on your Jeep as soon as you purchase the vehicle.  They're very easy to install and protect you from scratches that could lead to rust.  The guards fit perfectly on my 2011 Jeep Rubicon 2 door.

If you have a car with low fascia, these ramps will get the job done. The plastic appears rather flimsy, but they have held up fine under the weight of my car. The ramps have little rubber feet to keep them from sliding, these feet are not the full width of the ram, but rather a narrow section which can be unsteady when there's no weight on ramps.Overall a good deal! match my existing wheel chocks.  A little too big a radius on the curved side for my wheels, otherwise would be a 5-star. 
The Quik Interior Detailer is a great product from Meguiars. This provides the finish I like on my interior (not too glossy, but a nice clean matte finish).This interior detailer spray also has a nice smell to it. Safe for all surfaces (vinyl, leather, plastic, chrome, navigation/entertainment consoles and LCD screens). Doesn't add too much of a shine on the surfaces you apply it on, its just right and leaves a clean/streak free finish.  I use this on the non-leather surfaces in my car and on the black trim on the outside of my car Has some cleaning power to it, but nothing like an all purpose cleaner. Leaves a semi glossy appearance behind. Not too glossy but not matte. It's been about a month and it's still on my dash. 
It's a leveler.  What more do you need to know really.  You can roll your trailer onto it to level it out,  Worked for me!  Just make sure to check weight of your load you plan on putting on it. For most folks but if you need it and fail to use it really bad things will happen.I bought a Porsche where the previous owner had changed the plugs and failed to use the anti--seize and years later when it was time to change the plugs because you cannot actually see the plugs it is easier to remove the head to put repair helicoils into the aluminum as the plugs will not come out without taking the threads.  This is how the world works.  Failure to install something whre this product is needed will cost you dearly down the road. Before you begin anything with aluminum first find your bottle of anti seize so you know you can put the project back together without doing permanent damage. I own and use this lock, BUT do not get to comfy thinking it (or any lock) will stop a dedicated thief if they have time and tools. Yes, this is one of the few that fit Airstream's larger hitch housing. But, if you are trying to protect a costly rig, get a GPS tracking system AND do not advertise it with decals on the rig. Let the crook think he's not being monitored. Your GPS should be monitored 24hrs by the service company. Or, just keep enough insurance on your stuff for its replacement. And let's be aware that a lot of theft is the work of insiders that know what's behind the security gate. REMOVE the wheels when storing for the off season; and take the lugs with you. SLOW THE THIEF DOWN and track 'em. You'll increase your chance of recover. IF you want a REAL fighting chance with a hitch lock, take a look at: MEGAHITCH SECURITY LOCKS 
I haven't really used it yet for the reason intended, changing the oil in my jet ski.  So, I can't comment on how well it works.  The main reason for this review is to put it out there that it does not work with a 2000 Chevy Silverado.  The siphon tube does not fit thru the bottom of the dip stick tube.  It would be really nice if Mityvac had a published list of what vehicles it works with and what ones it does not.  I have my fingers crossed that it'll work with my jet ski, otherwise there will be a new/(un)used Mityvac on *****'slist.  Long story short, do your research to see if you can confirm or deny if it will work with your vehicle before you buy it. How can one really rate it, as it is used for protection and no idae how long it should last, yet is was as listed so I give it the benifit ogf the doubt... I probably should compare it to another to see how accurate it is, but I really like how easy it is to use and turns off and on by itself. 
No more using the penny or quarter to measure the tire tread. No more second guessing. With this gauge, you can see the actual measurement at an affordable cost. The only drawback I noticed,like some reviewers say, is it leaks oil. Fits for my Honda 2005 Lx.Comes with instruction that have pictures.I have to write more to finish this review. Matched my car's color perfectly!  I  don't know what else to say but there is a word count requirement for the review... 
It's an aftermarket replacement idler pulley.  It fits and works but I give it the extra star since it is a metal pulley instead of plastic (oem). Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars Very good and loud,I replaced my original horn on my Yamaha V-Star 650 Classic with this horn,used same bracket and just plugged it into factory horn wires.Now it sounds more like a truck instead of a VW bug.People notice this horn!Great price too. 
I use it everyday primarily for a storage cover.  I have not had the cover on the bike in rain or weather.  I got the XL for my CBR500R with full large rear bags and windshield.  I can lock my helmet to the rear seat area put the cover on and it will cover up the entire bikes exhaust and 3/4 of the rear tire and entire front tire.  Two bungies mid bike and front tire enable hokking cover under bike.  Very sturdy and breathable with exhaust panels (silver durable material) and inner windshield liner.  Much bang for the buck. Would certainly purchase another if I had to without question. First time bike left in rain this cover leaked! Bike was soaking wet! Do not purchase this cover! I Just purchased the heavy duty one at twice the price will see how that one does. I purchased the Battery Tender 800 Waterproof 12V Battery Charger because it is &#34;Waterproof&#34;. I keep it attached to my motorcycle that does not know to come in from out of the rain. Bike likes and I like. :-) 
It a belt... it fits, it hold and it rotates. There is no noise coming from it.Happy with the fit and performance. Even though Amazon says it does not fit my truck; it does fit my 2002 Chevrolet 2500HD crew cab with 6.0L gas engine. I replaced both sensors and harness. Both sensors were rough looking and the rear sensor had standing water on it. It was a little bit of a chore to get to them because you have to remove the intake but it was not too bad. Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. 
Sure the switch placement sucks,but I do like the pump overall.I can plug in to a 120 outlet or use the 12 volt car accessory outlet. These things are awesome.  I bought two along with some relays and relay sockets so I could get them enough power directly from the battery to do serious audible damage.  Make sure to buy this one with its mate, the 72112 low tone.  After wiring in the relays, these went in my 2000 Civic perfectly.  They replaced the crappy horn in there, and I used the wiring to tie into the relay signal hot wire.  Then, I grounded the relay to the body by tying it into the ground wire from one of the horns.  The horns come with these little wire slide connectors that you can clamp onto your wires.  I used wire nuts to tie all the wires together - I suggest you do the same.  I was able to mount them facing away from eachother with grounding connectors in between the mounts using a single bolt that held the old Honda horn.  This was ideal, and very clean - no drilling required!I suggest finding yourself a 12V DC 4-pin or 5-pin 40 Amp SPST ISO Micro Relay for this project.  Also, it really helps to have a 5-Pin Wire Harness Relay Socket.  This will give you all the wires you need directly from the relay.  These are really cheap items, and you shouldn't have trouble finding them.  The 4-pin relays work fine with the 5-pin sockets.  Then, educate yourself on how relays work, and wire that bad boy up!  I got my relay and relay socket on ebay.Overall, I'm very pleased with this product.  Buy it now if you want to be heard on the highway. These things are awesome.

I use this Dexron replacement fluid in my 12,000+ pound F-Super Duty utility truck's ZF 5 speed transmission and parking brake unit-Group IV synthetic, and able to take the shock loads of a gear oil! Mobil 1 V-Twin 20W-50 Synthetic Motor Oil for Motorcycle is great synthetic oil for your bike and the price is very competitive. My 98 toyota Sienna has 135k miles and recently got a engine check light (CEL).  The code was P0420 (catalytic converter).  A new CAT is expensive, so I gave CRC a try.  I put a bottle of CRC to the gas and followed the instruction.  I also reset the CEL using a OBD II scanner.The result:The smog numbers (CO,HC,O2) were improved by about 5 to 10% but not enough to pass the California smog check. 
The meter has all the functions you could ask for a multimeter in a compact size.  The digits are large for the size of the meter, so it's easily readable by middle aged eyes. It does get a bit warm while providing the 5 amps of power to the Koolatron car cooler (which I took into hotel rooms at night), but it did exactly what it was supposed to do so can't complain. One issue: There are two different sizes for so-called "cigarette lighter" outlets. This has the "big" size, which means "small" size plugs can have issues. Solution if that is a problem for your particular plug is simply to use a toothpick to "shim" the small-size plug into the large-size socket. This is one-size-fits-most. It works on the filter for my 2002 Volkswagen Passat, but it's too large to grip the filter on my 1993 Chevrolet S10. 
If the charging system is completely dead and the engine is running on battery voltage only, this monitor will display green (as in everything is okay) as it it goes into battery check mode.  While the low display voltage will tell you something is definitely wrong with the charging system, the green light can be a little misleading. I have one permanently connected on my mini-motorhome.  It works great while connected to AC power AND the engine is running.  Whenever I'm hooked up to AC power, the battery is maintained when powered up and not damaged when the engine is running.  I'd surely call this a must have for RV's. I bought a cheaper charger first but they changed product design by eliminated the essential second LED indicator.  When I plug it in to my car, I have no idea is the charger is working or it just indicate the battery is connected, very dumb.  The Batter Tender Junior has 4 modes indication, very useful when connection wire having problem or the charger is not working probably. 
This little item is surprisingly powerful and worth having. It's great for the occasional inflation of any tire from riding mower wheels, trailer wheels, to car tires. It's loud, so what. That just means it's working. The gauge is easy to read, i.e., I'm almost blind and I can read it. For what it does -- INFLATE -- it does better than expected. However, as many have noted, it does have a few design shortcomings. Among them are longer cords, better storage departments, perhaps a wider profile, a metal, not plastic valve connector. But you can see that Black & Decker's primary design goal was for this item to be compact and fit out of the way wherever you store it. After a year's worth of uses in -10F to 102F temperatures, I just wish I had bought it sooner! These little things are really cool, so I would recommend them if you don't mind drilling out your plate mounts. I just wonder what kind of idiot would use larger screws in their product than the US standard. They aren't much bigger than the pads on my camper jack. I guess the best thing I can say about them is they keep my jack pads out of the dirt so they wont rust. They do help a little bit. But I wish they were a little bigger. 
This thing has 2 readouts and 4 scales and no instructions on how to read any of htem.  The SWR is easy enough to figure out but the others are anyones guess, came with some little wire antenna that is nowhere in the one sheet instruction that comes with it.  The signal strength meter dosn't seem to register at all.  It was cheap enough and probelly works, but your  have to find an engineer to tell you how to use it. Reviewing a battery tender quick disconnect extension cable is not easy - what should you say about it?First it is a good quality - no cheap stuff. The isolation is very good and also the plugs are perfectly made.I installed it under the seat of my Buell xb12ss to extend the SAE plug up to my speedometer where I useit with a SAE to USB adapter to charge my iPhone 5 when using it in my waterproof RAM mount to navigate. Closes screen back and locks it into jam, its great when door is attached to screen minimizes the outside door fromm flying open as well if you add more tension to spring buy pulling in longer then screwing it. Now Instructions very minimal. It shows you on faded small diagram how it works and how to do it kind of. But I would say, it would make sense to tell you to install spring as close to inner door jam as possible. After I looked at it for some time it made sense. Maybe I just like instructions that are so clear grandma can do it without thinking if shes doing it right. But needless to say I would say this is a great idea for any RV door. 
0W-40 is my favorite motor oil, and have been using it since 2005.  It's perfect for extreme cold and hot temperatures, it's lightweight, and it's been proven to be superior.  I do notice my cars eat oil when using this, but that's because of it's unique weight.  You have to pay to play, though. have not tried to put the support to use yet, but was purchased for this summer use.I have never used one previously but will use it for sure. I use this in my RV to both preserve the gas (from degradation with age) and to &#34;treat&#34; the engine and generator. 
The Tender Jr. does not come with a cigarette adapter so I cut this in half to make two. I purchased 2 lighter plugs for a buck each from China&#8230; with free shipping&#8230; and they are working fine. These aren&#8217;t an exact match with the Tender cables but they fit together OK and are easy to determine polarity with the wire colors. You can also just use this as an extension cord for your Tender. The description states a length of 12-inches&#8230; but it&#8217;s actually 14-inches tip-to-tip on the connectors. Nice item for the price and it&#8217;s made in Mexico. A good Made in USA chock.  It may cost about a buck less each at Walmart, if you can find it.There is a hole in the side for a rope to hold one or two together for each side of the tire.  Don't buy the one with a rope. It costs twice as much for the same one chock, NOT two.The heavy rubber  Buyers Rubber Wheel Chock - 5in.W, Model# WC1467A  at $8.99 each at Northern Tools are heavier and provides a better grip on concrete, but they are heavy to carry around.  I use the Buyers' ones in the garage and carry the Camco ones in my trunk.Also NOTE that the Buyer's ones are made in the same place as the expensive Race Ramps Branded ones costing 50% more.  The Buyers ones are nearly identical, are exactly the same size and weight.  The Race Ramps ones have shallow slits cut into the bottom. Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. 
I actually bought one for each car and I am very pleased! It is easy to handle and read and needs no batteries like the ones thatpretend to be more accurate. Like title says I bought them to replace the wimpy locking acknowledgement/alarm horn with this low tone American truck sounding that is also louderThe only downside I can think of, it is considerably larger and I had to cut the factory harness to attach it.I'm buying a second set for my dads Silverado. His horn just crapped out on himWould give 5 stars if it was louderPS I bought them &#34;used&#34; but were like new. no signs of wear at all. just got a cheaper price I need this converter (110V to 12V) for powering a electric cooler (Koolatron P25).I picked this one as it was less pricey like some others (>$40!) and the reviews were good.The item works as advertised. Of course it gets warm, nothing to get excited about. I had a splitter attached to it and powered a electric fan in addition. I noticed only a very small drop in the fan speed once the cooler was attached.I will need another one, I am tempted to try the Black & Decker / Vector CV6B Travel Mate which outputs 6 Amps. Only 1 Amp more, am not sure how big the difference would be. It costs $3 more.

There are many of them for less than this.Fake! I am obviously upset.** UPDATE **: So, it is Dec 2012 and I am updating this. I found this exact same horn at the local auto parts store. It was black with the red stripe, and I bought it. Got home to swap out the horns and noticed the one I got on here was an FIAMM brand. So, I would guess whoever shipped me my stuff simply sent the wrong item. I never thought to check that it was the right brand, though.I have updated my star rating to 4.

First, you will need to buy the high tone also, or it will sound stupid. It is part #72102. I have put these pair on my last 4 cars. The low tone does have a habit of failing if it gets wet. This has happened twice to me. For some reason, the high tone works fine if it gets wet. Make sure you mount the low tone in a location where it will not get wet.The kit does not include a relay. You may want to install a relay, especially if your car is wired for one horn. The horns draw 4.5A each at 12V. This is usually within factory limits and most fuseboxes will have a 10A or larger relay built in the horn circuit. The kit does include 3 female blade connectors, a mounting bracket and nut, and a jumper wire (needed if your car is wired with one horn lead).And, they are very loud. Packaging declares 130db at 4 inches. I do not have a db meter, but I can assure you the horns will get the job done. The pair has a nice tone, and will rid your car of the little factory &#34;meep meep&#34; horns. Do you need a chrome oil filter? Of course not. Do you want one? Of course you do, it looks nice. If your working with spark plugs you need this. As standard as they come and guaranteed to work.  Helped me gap my plugs with no problems. If you don't know how to use, just youtube it. 
I was using this to power my Viair 00073 70P Heavy Duty Portable Compressor but with 6amp it doenst do the Job, returned it and went with Schumacher 1216 12V 15 Amp Power Converter, good to go! It is smart to give warning lights as it can differentia between battery and alternator voltage. After a power outage, I connected my refrigerator to this power supply. Sadly, its inverter was unable to support my refrigerator. The Duracell DPP-600HD doesn't have enough momentary  output to handle the initial start-up current spike of a refrigerator's compressor motor. The specifications say it can momentarily provide up to 960 watts. This equates to 8 amps at 120v.  Yet, public benchmark figures for a home refrigerator's start-up current indicate 13 amps for up to 1/2 second. Other appliances that use electric motors such as sump pumps are likely to exhibit the same characteristics. My suggestion is that customers immediately test this product with any device they intend to power during an outage.Some important specifications are missing in the Amazon listing.  One of the key statics is the capacity of the internal battery, which is 28 amp-hours at 12 v.  This equates to 336 watt hours.  Yet, AC output is much lower than this presumably due to inverter losses.  These losses increase with power output.  The following table illustrates this.  The last column is my calculation.load.................watts....hours....watt-hoursCordless telephone.....5........35.0 ...175Portable stereo.........10........22.0 ...220Laptop computer.......20........7.0 ....140Fan.......................100.........1.7....17036" TV...................133........1.2 ....1603/8 drill.................300........0.4 ....115Warm-air fan heater.312........0.4 ....109Blender..................385........0.3 ....109HID Floodlights.......400........0.3.....107Observe that the total energy delivered (watt-hour) drops with power consumption.  Ultimately, the usable energy is significantly less than what is contained within the lead acid battery.For reference, a refrigerator will use about 200 watts of electricity when the compressor is running. Typical consumers will have their refrigerator running about 50% to 60% of the time, which equates to an average of 100-120 watts being consumed continuously.ConsDoesn't handle current spikes associated with certain electric motorsProsBoth AC and DC outputPortableSimple operation

These horns are just the ticket in replacing stock inferior horns. These are a much nicer sounding horn than the loud blast of an air horn. Perfect horns to boost the warning ability of your vehicle without sounding like a Big Rig. These are typical hard plastic handles, contoured for grip. The stock bar is substantial at 7/16". Edges are finished nicely. The metal shaft is unpolished and has a finish to prevent slippage.I don't care if all my hand tools are the same color, if it matters to you then note these may come in a different color than illustrate (see my pics).Made in the U.S.A. - nice.j I couldn't agree more with the pluses made by other reviewers; see any 5 star reviews.However, it has 1 major drawback as general purpose test leads.Lantern tipsThe head of the main probes is flared like a male banana jack, Fluke calls these 'lantern tip probes'.  This is helpful when inserting the jacks into banana females and for much electrical work, but when probing tight spaces like circuit components or feet of through hole DIP ICs, and worse on SMT components, lantern probes make the tips too wide, even if they are sharp.  Sometimes minigrabbers will work, but most times simple thin leads are all that's universally needed.Worst of all, you cannot insert these probes into a NEMA power socket to check the status of the hot or neutral lines, but it will fit the ground plug.  They are better for general electrical work for circular holes found in European style power sockets.In addition:PVCPVC is widely used, including as a low cost insulator for electrical wiring.  Alas, both in the EU and USA, there is a move to restrict its use for consumer products because its plasticizers is associated with major health issues; soft PVC [e.g. wires] is more a problem than hard PVC [e.g. drainage pipes].  Its not a problem for wires installed in homes, but as a test lead the user makes daily contact with PVC, or if ignited accidentally such as during a current surge or a solder iron misplacement, may release dioxin.Other than that, these leads are just as electrically good as a $50+ Fluke lead setFluke Corporation TL220 Industrial Test Lead Kit.What does >3x more cost get you?  The Fluke probe tips are the common thin design.  Fluke leads use silicone-rubber instead of PVC, a more expensive insulator that is lighter, and inert [its used from breast implants to tubing used in the food industry], more supple, soft, and easier to grip.  The Extech use PVC.  They are both electrically capable of CAT III-1000V rating and more, but the Fluke materials make probing with these leads repeatedly less taxing, something a professional electrician would notice with daily use.In September 2010, Extech released their own silicone test leads and kits.  It uses the standard thin probe tip, like Fluke.  A pair of the Extech leads alone cost as much as their entire PVC based test lead kit, so part of the Fluke's higher cost is at least in the materials. 
I went through several different shades trying to find one that would fit a large windshield.  The Basic Jumbo shade fits the bill, plus it folds up nicely.  If you have a large truck, van, or other vehicle that has a large windshield, then this product will likely fulfill your needs.  Since this is actually two different pieces, you can place them horizonallty or vertically.  The only downside is that there is no opening for a mirror, but I find that these go over the mirror and are easily held up with the sunvisors.The material is thin, but appears to be very strong.  The shields fold up into a small circle (about 12" across) for storage.  Unfold slightly and they pop out into their full size and shape.  To fold them back, just bend in slightly and turn your wrists.  They bounce right back into the small circles. First perfectly on Toyota GenII Prius which includes model years 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009. The replacement is super easy, taking less than 2 minutes if you know what you are doing. If you have never done it before, save yourself $80 at the dealership and take 5-10 minutes to do it.1) Open the lower glovebox2) Squeeze in on the sides of the glovebox near the top where there are 2 plastic cylinders that keep the glovebox from falling to the ground and lower the glovebox past where the stoppers stop it from going3) Remove the little piston on the right side of the glovebox that slows its decent by moving the ring part to the right and off of its little plastic nub house.4) The glovebox should now completely detach, and you can rest it somewhere where it won't get scratched.5) The white box directly behind the glovebox contains the HVAC blower motor that gives you air circulation in the car as well as the filter. There are two tabs on the left and right sides of the smaller rectangle on top. Squeeze the tabs and pull towards you. This small book sized thing will come out completely. Take this to a garbage pail or outside and remove the cloth filter from inside.6) Replace filter with this one. Make sure to put the flat side on the bottom like the original and position the little tabs over the fabric to hold it loosly in place.7) Replace the white small book with new filter into the slot you removed it from above the blower motor assembly. Note that the white plastic piece you removed has the words &#34;Up&#34; or &#34;Top Side&#34; molded into the plastic. Make sure to install it so that these words are right side up (readable).8) Replace glove box reverse of disassembly9) Enjoy the $80 to $120 you saved versus going to the stealership and know that it was done correctly. I use this to open my screen door without having to to open the sliding panel to reach inside to open the door.  Keeps bugs out while making the door easier to open from outside. 
Great quality.  American made. Made in China poor quality item that does not befit the Robert Bosch brand at all.Not for winter for sure.The origin of the product should be stated at the product page.If I knew it were a MADE-IN-CHINA I would not have bought it. Considering this is made in China, it is a quality product, too bad all my locks are keyed to the some number 
Very nice addition to my car. I bolted it directly to the inside of my driver's side door so it's easily found. This device attaches securely to the tow vehicle, but at a cost.They are cumbersome to attach and detach, with several moving parts and the potential to scratch the tow vehicle paint during either process if you don't have three hands available.To attain the secure vibration free fit, you must crank down on the ratcheted web strap hard enough to deform the door where it attaches to the window channel. It also deforms the rubber window seal.Foam pads protect the door somewhat where the bracket would otherwise rub on the body, but if the area isn't meticulously clean beforehand I can see where it would dull the paint over time.Because of the metal claw part that fits into the window channel, raising and lowering the window caused a screeching sound on my driver's side window.Finally, when they are detached from the door, they make for a very bulky awkward device that doesn't store conveniently or compactly in the vehicle.I'm sending them back. Very good product.  Now my wife can pull into the garage without backing up and maneuvering her car to get it right.  Easy to install.  As a point of reference for her, I put a small &#34;cupboard door&#34; disc on the dash.  When we pull the car in all she needs to do is get the light to be within an inch of the &#34;cupboard door&#34; disc on the dash 360 degrees and the car is parked perfect.  Our garage is a 3 car one, but with my car, motor cycle, large mower, tools, tool chest, garbage cans, lawn equipment, wall cabinets,  etc....we need to make sure we manage the space.  And now we have more space. 
would recommend getting a  size  smaller than  what the  &#34;sizing chart&#34; recommends  as  I  measure aroun my leg  as  recommended  and  the chaps  were  one size too large.. otherwise they are  awesome  quality and build The meter has all the functions you could ask for a multimeter in a compact size.  The digits are large for the size of the meter, so it's easily readable by middle aged eyes. The 2 x 2 Inch mirrors are a good fit for 2006 Honda Pilot. I had to order via Amazon since I couldn't find these anywhere - it appears local auto stores only carry the 3 x 3 inch size. These little blind spot mirrors are a must buy item - they cover the blind spots on either side of the vehicle very well. 
OK. this one is cheap, and it looks like it. When you hold the handle, it feels like it as well. Cheap plastic.Does the job, but I would probably throw it away when it gets dirty. Works great IF you have a surface that will give some friction, like concrete or asphalt.  Get two, tie them together about 18&#34; apart.  Harder to lose AND you get to look like one of those guys at the airport pre-flighting a plane ;-} ! Great to stop small leaks!It's a standard black silicone in a tube instead of a can.Silicone gets rubbery hard.Squeeze, and apply. Works like expected! 
Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. This fits not only the Ecotec, but newer VW TDI's with the canister filter.  Works great, relatively low profile and goes nicely on a 3/8&#34; drive.  I accidentally ordered three (fat fingered the cart), and sold one to a fellow VW driver and one to a guy with a GM. 
I've an Optima in my old Corvette that has now failed.  I've have read thru their warranty information.  It states that the battery must be returned to the selling dealer for warranty service.  It cannot be returned to Amazon for any reason.  Therefore my question is this:If the battery purchased thru amazon should require warranty service, how is this done and by whom? I have this wiper in my garage ready to install when my other wiper needs to be replaced.  I was a little disturbed that the box that the wiper came in was battered, but I examined the wiper and it looked ok.  I contacted Valeo about their warranty and was shocked to hear that I had to deal with the seller (Amazon) for warranty.  Amazon offers only thirty day returns and by the time I install the wiper, the thirty days will be up.  I think Valeo, a well known wiper blade manufacturer, should handle the warranty coverage on their products beyond the thirty days offered by Amazon.  I think Amazon agrees. I ordered one of these for my 2008 Saturn Vue. Package marked for 2008 Vue but item did not work. Contacted storefront who fullfilled order for Amazon and was referred to Curt mfg. to obtain return number. Then had to contact seller again. Got a refund but I purchased a replacement from a local dealer. Seller later reported a wrong item number was somehow in the package. 
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Inexpensive, yet works as good as the ones sold by Honda dealerships. Made true to specs and fits right into the slot on my Accord 2006.Will buy again. bought this for my 2004 honda crv.  fit perfectly and cleared the code.  easy to do just give the threads some wd40 
Don't buy this rear wiper for a 1st generation xB, it will NOT fit! Get OEM or a wiper from elsewhere! Perfect fit for rear wiper blade replacement on an 06 Equinox.  The opening for the J-Hook is big enough for you to slide the new wiper blade in without problems. Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlander 
As good as the factory original. Thanks for the tip from one of the other reviewers to drill a small hole in the top of the cap in order to attach the existing leash. (It doesn't come with one) The Tender Jr. does not come with a cigarette adapter so I cut this in half to make two. I purchased 2 lighter plugs for a buck each from China&#8230; with free shipping&#8230; and they are working fine. These aren&#8217;t an exact match with the Tender cables but they fit together OK and are easy to determine polarity with the wire colors. You can also just use this as an extension cord for your Tender. The description states a length of 12-inches&#8230; but it&#8217;s actually 14-inches tip-to-tip on the connectors. Nice item for the price and it&#8217;s made in Mexico. This tail bag easily attaches to the motor cycle. 4 straps with a loop on one end and a quick connect on the other.  Also there is one strap with quick connects on each end and all are adjustable length. good bag for the price.

For the price, an excellent wiper. Now, I did just put them on so it depends on how long they stay good for, but so far they work very well. Why did I choose Rain-X? Because they were heavily advertised during a lot of Formula 1 races back in the day and that kinda stuck with me.NOTE: A lot of people seem to wonder what size blades fit their vehicle. Either do a quick google search, check your owner manual, or just get a tape measure and measure the length of each blade on your car. Typically the driver side blade is a bit longer by an inch or two. We got the universal-type wiper blade rather than the blade with a connector designed especially for our car. That means that the connector looks a little conspicuous -- bulky and out of place -- compared to the one on the old blade. It's not a big problem, but when there is not much to differentiate different replacement wiper blades, it may be a reason to try to get a version designed for your specific car.These wiper blades were easy to attach, and so far work fine. The studies I have read say all wiper blades tend to last about the same amount of time. It's hard to say how long these will last, but so far, so good. The blade is good. The materials, construction, and water removal are all good. I tried the C-19-UB on the passenger side of my GS350 and it worked as well as the 24" factory one on the driver side. The Anco blade is molded with a spoiler, which makes it similar in appearance to the factory wiper of the GS350 which is the holder and the refill assembly. I rate the product 3 stars for the high cost not justified by any additional benefit over the factory blade refill.There two points I wanted to make are:1. Attention must be paid to letters -OE or -UB at the end of the blade model. I suggest using the Amazon fit guide at the top of the product page or visiting Anco website to find specific models that will fit your vehicle. I ordered -OE blades thinking -OE stood for Original Equipment. My family owns and previously owned Toyota/Lexus cars and I am only familiar with the "cane handle" type of a windshield wiper arm. Anco -OE blades will not fit this type of connector. Additionally, the Product Description says that the blade has an "OE-style spoiler", so it is even more confusing what OE in the model number refers to. Anyway, Toyota and Lexus have a "cane handle" type wiper arm and only blade models ending in -UB will fit this connector.2. I think these replacement blades are just too expensive. I usually buy wiper blade refills at the dealer for about ten dollars for two. These blades cost two to three times that (depending on the availability of a rebate). I tried a C-19-UB alongside with the factory 24" blade on my GS350 and I did not find Anco blade to clean the windshield any better than the factory blade does. On one of my previous cars, I tried Valeo 900 Ultimate blades (similar to Anco Contour). I had the same opinion that, although these replacement blades work well, they do not work better than factory refills, and their high cost makes them unappealing to me. I do not find that at 2-3 times the cost of factory refills, these blades work 2-3 times better. 
Easy to apply. Long lasting protectant This cabin air filter works well and gives my vehicle a nice clean, fresh scent.  The scent seems to not last too long and the scent is not overwhelming.  I like that!  Well done Fram! I love the smell but the shine on my leather jacket doesn't last too long.  I would say about 3 days to a week. 
The horns were easy to install. They draw about the same amount of current as my stock horns (in the 2.5A to 3A range for each PIAA horn), so I was able to use the stock wiring, relay, and fuse instead of having to wire a separate connection to the battery positive. I used Installation Type B (two horns, each with a single wire). The stock horn positive connections plugged directly into the positive quick connect of the PIAA horns. I didn't have to cut off the stock connectors and crimp on new connectors. The stock horns use a single connection, so I ran a separate ground wire from each PIAA horn to a ground point near the hood latch.I made an inverted T bracket to hang the two horns off of the location for one of the stock horns. The PIAA horns are a bit larger than a typical stock "beep-beep" style Japanese horn, so you do have to plan ahead to make sure that you have enough room for the horns and whatever mounting bracket you may use. I angled my PIAA horns slightly outward (instead of hanging straight down) to clear an engine brace below the horns.The horns have a nice Euro sound and are suitably loud. The 3rd generation powerprobe includes a number of changes for additional flexibility.  In short, it is a vehicle powered DVM with both a 20 foot cable and an additional 20 foot extension giving you a 40 foot working range around either the battery terminals or cigarette lighter outlet, both clips and a plug are included in the kit.With the series 3 units they use a hard gold plated banana jack to hold the removable probe or cables to extend your reach.  If you purchase the accessory kit, it includes piercing probes that self center on a conductor, pierce the insulation, and attach to the jack allowing you to tap a wire at any point to locate intermittant problems.While the DVM is backlit all the time, it also has 2 bright white LEDs facing forward to aid in finding and probing terminals in dark places.  The actual probe is hardgold plated with a sharp tip and removable at the banana jack.  Another identical probe is included with a screw-in female banana jack in the accessories kit to retrofit the powerprobe I and II units to accept external cables and probes.If you need to excite a circuit with a connection to battery ground or to battery positive, the switch allows a momentary connection to bridge the probe tip to either voltage which is useful in testing relay driven circuits, indicator lights, and other small current loads.  The prope voltage is always displayed during testing on the meter. The voltage/ground switch is circuit breaker protected in case you accidentally drive 12 volts into a chassis ground.  Additionally, since the switch takes abuse it is easily replaced if it fails with just a screwdriver.Combined with the testlead set, the powerprobe 3 greatly simplifies testing of vehicular wire and big rigs up to a single trailer.  The DVM has 5 selectable modes of operation designed for different problems.  Reading the manual is important to get the full value from this meter.Although the price is a little high, the design and construction quality are excellent.  Enough wire is provided to check running lights on trailers or to look for blown fuses.  All of the wiring is exceptionally flexible and heavily insulated with top quality connectors.  Both the tester and accessories come in hard plastic cases that can be stowed in a service box.Not mentioned in specifications is that although the probe runs from 12-24 VDC, the meter can be used to measure voltages up to 80VDC. I cut the horn off the compressor. The horn will fit under the stock cowbell. The compressor was attached under the right side panel to the frame with 3 large zip ties. I ran some hose from home depot to the cowbell and connected it to the stock horn wire. The horn sound goes right between the cylinders and is loud as h3ll.  Many of cell phone scum bags will tell you that my set up works real good.

I set it on 10amp it charged it fully saying it was on 10amp but it had swiched to 2amp for final charge which is how a fully automatic charger is supposed to work. When the charged light came on my Kline multimeter says the Optima is fully charged. If it didn't I would send it back to Amazon, which is how you are instructed to handle an issue like that, and they will deal with Optima. I also love the size of this charger. It is very small, and light, and easy to use. Another good experience from Amazon. How can one really rate it, as it is used for protection and no idae how long it should last, yet is was as listed so I give it the benifit ogf the doubt... 
This is not a booster pack for people who don't know how to use one. There's no safety features. No off switch. No silly blinking lights and pumps and sirens. It's meant to start a dead vehicle and that's exactly what it does. The long cables make it easier to use than some others as well. The voltage gauge is a great feature too, as it lets you know how much is left in it rather than just a couple lights. I required an ammonia-free window cleaner for my tinted windows. This does the job quite nicely. It isn't how well it does, rather how safely it does it. This is the old stand-by and works very well - you can always turn so you can see the dial.  It doesn't always sit well on the stems for some reason, but using this with an air compressor is so much faster than a small 12-volt compressor and hand gauge.

There are two horns, not one. One is 400Hz and the other one is 500Hz.PIAA | Automotive Sports Horn (400/500Hz) #85110The are exact fits on the mounts as the OEM horns and use the same bolts. A 1/4 inch drive ratchet and a 12mm socket is needed to remove and install the bolt. They came with grounding leads with ring spade lugs that mounted readily under the existing M6 bolts on the radiator supports. All you need is a 10mm socket.The two wiring harness leads are too short to connect the horns. Two wire tie mounts hold the harness to the aluminum bumper reinforcement. You can cut off the ties and use the OEM harness to connect the horns, but I chose not to.  I prefer NOT to cut off the OEM connector blocks.I made two pigtail extensions out of 18 gauge black primary wire, 5 inches long. One end needs a 1/4 inch wide exposed male quick disconnect. The other end needs an insulated female 1/4 inch quick disconnect terminal. Since I used 18 gauge wire, I used the red coded ones.The exposed male connector slides into the OEM horn connector perfectly. The female one clips easily onto the positive terminal of each horn.The horns how have a weather shield on the apertures.Best thing to my surprise is that they appear to be very high quality and Made in Japan.Also nice is that they need no modification to the horn relay or circuit. Heavy rubber, good gauge coated snap connectors; comes with variety of components necessary to test different configurations of sparkplug on vehicles/equipment.Has extended accessory to test recessed plugs, such as those on a Ford Triton engine (coil on plug setup).This test set will indicate YES/NO as to 'fire' - not a measurement of current.In sum, if I'm experiencing a miss at idle or under load, and static ohm's are good, and this tester indicates all plugs receiving fire, there is high probability a weak coil exists.  I then pull/reinsert plug wires one at-a-time while engine is running/stumbling to pinpoint faulty plug/wire/coil - (o'skool way).Kyle 
Does what it says it does......looks great ! It does what it is supposed to and suds up. It does what it is supposed to do, that is to increase placement distance from the car to the electrical outlet 
First, you will need to buy the high tone also, or it will sound stupid. It is part #72102. I have put these pair on my last 4 cars. The low tone does have a habit of failing if it gets wet. This has happened twice to me. For some reason, the high tone works fine if it gets wet. Make sure you mount the low tone in a location where it will not get wet.The kit does not include a relay. You may want to install a relay, especially if your car is wired for one horn. The horns draw 4.5A each at 12V. This is usually within factory limits and most fuseboxes will have a 10A or larger relay built in the horn circuit. The kit does include 3 female blade connectors, a mounting bracket and nut, and a jumper wire (needed if your car is wired with one horn lead).And, they are very loud. Packaging declares 130db at 4 inches. I do not have a db meter, but I can assure you the horns will get the job done. The pair has a nice tone, and will rid your car of the little factory &#34;meep meep&#34; horns. HI,This product is a great product that helps you to eliminate rattles/vibrations when you are installing speakers into a vehicle's car doors, rear panels, decks, etc.  It does exactly that and it does it well.There are many claims about it stopping distortion, noise, etc....  However, it should be noted that if you are over powering a speaker..distortion will occur and no padding can stop that.Dynamat has been around for ever and continues to provide a solution that eliminates rattle and vibration.  Use it for that and you will agree that it is a 5 Star Product.  Expect miracles and you will be disappointed. if you hook them up right, they work amazing. having so many settings allows me to have options for the mood i am in. the sound setting doesnt work so well unless the music is really blasting tho. other than that, they are great. 
I bought these horns to replace the weak sounding horn that Toyota puts in the Corolla, Matrix, Prius, Yaris, ect.. These horns are very load to say the least. The Hella box included one low tone horn and one high tone horn. It also included instructions and a single Bosch style relay.There is NO wiring of any kind included with this purchase (this is why I gave it a 4 star). I made my own wiring harness which included a 30 amp fusible link, and the included relay and a relay socket. The following link is to the picture of my install on my 2006 Toyota Matrix XR:[...]Make sure you use the included relay in your install. I know some people have just used the existing single horn wire (not using relay), but these new horns have a pretty heavy amp draw! The last thing you want to do is mess up your factory wiring because of some horns. Do it the right way, and follow the instructions! Your horns will also sound better.You can not beat the price and sound quality of these horns! They will get your attention, I can promise you that.  I do recommend these horns! GLAD  I  WENT  WITH  THE  CHROME AND  NOT  THE BLACK ONE, I  HOOKED  THIS ONE UP TO  MY GV1400 MOTORCYCLE IF  YOU  HAVE JUST  A  LITTLE  KNOW  HOW YOU CAN  DO  IT YOUR SELF , ALL  YOU WILL NEED TO GO WITH THIS IS A RELAY THAT DOES NOT COME WITH IT. YOU  CAN  GET IT ON HERE OR ANY PART STORE, I  HAVE MADE MANY PEOPLE JUMP  DUE  TO THE SOUND OF  THE  HORNS  LOUDNESS. I put this plug into my BMW F650GS and it runs like a different bike.  No stumble or surging at part throttle and great response all the way to red line.  I was thinking I was going to have to get a $200 electronic device to fix the stumble but an $8 plug fixed it.  I wouldn't have believed it but....... just saying. 
Consider this...  The combine cost of your tow vehicle and trailer...  The combine weight of your tow vehicle and trailer...  The fact that your trailer may well weigh more than your tow vehicle...  And that moron that just jumped in your lane then slammed on his brakes...  This is NOT the time to think to yourself, "maybe I should've gotten a better brake controller."  Seriously, when the difference in cost is under $100, is it really not worth buying the best?I've used the Tekonsha P3 for two and half years now and I have nothing but praises to sing!  Features, user friendliness, and results!  This unit has it all.  First lets talk about the mechanism.  It uses a digital G-Sensor as apposed to a physical pendulem.  Why is this a benifit?  Because there are no downhill issues that you see with the physical and analog type sensors.  Prior to digial sensors, the downhill slope would throw off the pendulem and the brake controller either would send a weaker current to the brakes or none at all.  Some people have questioned the reliablity of digital sensors.  But with more than 10 years of full production digital units, complaints are actaully less than the older analog units.  Consider this as well, the sensor is not only quicker but more accurate as well, hard to soft braking is much safer now.  How does it work?  Just like any other accelerometor...it senses the volume deceleration and then computes an appropriate voltage and current to send to the trailer brakes based on a percentage of the user's max output setting.Let's talk interface.  A four button face with a roughly 1.5" LCD display plus a belly mounted manual switch.  With no brakes connected, this unit will dispay the default "Tekonsha Screen".  Once brakes are connected via the trailer plug, the unit will display the "Tow Screen".  It has a large two/three read out that displays 0.0 as a default.  While sitting still and once brake pressure is applied it will jump to approximately 10% of the max set output, after 3 seconds of being stationary it will move up to 25% power.  This is designed to "hold" the trailer if stopped on an incline or decline.  Setting the max brake power is a snap with the two "Up" and "Down" buttons on the left side of the face.  The value moves up and down by 0.1 increments and quite quickly if you hold the button down.  The last two buttons are "boost" and "page" which I will discuss when I talk features.  The last button is the manual brake override.  This bottom mounted spring loaded slider switch will manually add braking power to the trailer brakes (up to the user set max) even without depressing the vehicles brake peddle.  This is a standard feature on all brake contorllers, but I wanted anyone looking for their first brake controller to understand what this was.  Lastly, is the warning screen.  It's a deep red screen with a trailer and a "no" sign.  This indicates that the controller which had previously sensed brakes connected no longer can sense them.  Generally an indication of a poor trailer connection at the wiring harness or a problem with the brakes themsleves.Let's talk features.  I've mentioned the "Boost" button, but what is it?  There are 4 levels of boost for trailer brakes.  Off, LV. 1, LV. 2, & LV. 3.  Boost adds a brief (fraction of a second) burst to the trailer brakes which slows the trailer slightly more than the normal pressure would and keeps it from bumping or pushing the tow vehicle when brake pressure is initailly applied.  Very important if as many are these days, your trailer weighs more than your tow vehicle.  After the burst it returns the voltage and current to the G-sensors reccomended output.  There isn't a real scientific method for figuring what you need to use.  The picture on the home screen shows LV1 as small trailer, 2 as a med tailer, and 3 as a large trailer.  My trailer is a 6K lb. TT and I just leave it on the default LV. 1 boost.  Everytime the units is powered it returned to the default LV. 1.  The unit will power down after 15 mins with no trailer connected AND no input from the brake signal wire.  The "Page" button will take you to a second screen that you navigate with the "up", "down", and "Boost" (now "enter") buttons.  This sceen has some cool features as some useful features.  "Backlight" allows you to brighten or dim the brightness of the display.  "Color" lets you set the color of the display.  (Yeah I know, unessesary, but cool)  The default color is "White" which is more of a light blue.  There's also Magenta, Orange, Dk Blue, Violet, Lt. Green, and Dk. Green.  Red is not availible as it's reserved as a warning color for the "no trailer connection" warning screen.  Back to the page screen.  There's also a VERY USEFUL troubleshooting screen.  It lets you view diagnostics on the fly and over the road that can give you four digit readouts of battery voltage, stoplight (brake input signal) voltage, brake voltage, and brake current.  This screen alone is worth the cost of this brake controller!  When you first connect your tailer do some tests and record the max input you set, the output under normal braking conditions, as well as the brake voltage and amperage.  If down the line you get the feeling the brakes aren't working properly, you can re-run this test and see if it's an electrical problem or not.  Finally when your done, pressing the page button will return you to the "tow screen."Installation.  A snap for anyone that has a factory tow package.  Tekonsha offers plug and play wiring harnesses that plug into most make and model years of trucks.  If you have to have it installed or choose to install it yourself as I did, it can be challenging.  But it's a simple four wire hookup.  A 12V input from the battery (running thru a 30A auto reset breaker NOT a fuse), an output to the brake pin of your 6 or 7-way trailer connector, a stoplight input running to your vehicle's stoplight switch behind the brake peddle, and lastly a frame ground.  The mount can be a little challenging to install because of the akward access to the screws, but it can be mounted at nearly any angle other than strait up or down and provided the face is facing a close to directly rearward as possible.All in all, this is probably the most important review I've ever done.  This controller will save you grief and keep you and your vehicle safe.  Make sure for your safety, your families safety, and the safety of all those on the road you buy the brake controller that does it's job the best.  Buy the Tekonsha P3. Makes easy work of filling your batteries. You don't have to see into the holes just push down and wait for the gurgling to stop.always the correct level. Basically, this is a voltmeter, similar to a hand-held VOM, and designed to read static voltage and the voltage being pushed to the battery from the alternator as the engine revs ... automobile or motorcycle (having a 12v socket).  The cigarette lighter convenience is what attracted me ... I don't have to juggle a meter and wires with my head under the hood or standing alongside the bike trying to rev it and hold wires and meter, etc.  Tested it already and it seems dead-on with readings at or just a tad under what the hand-held shows.  It's coming on to winter and it's nice, when checking fluids and tire pressure, to do periodic checks on the charging system so you don't get that gut-dropping &#34;click-click-click&#34; when you turn the key in some dark, empty parking lot somewhere you don't want to be! 
if you hook them up right, they work amazing. having so many settings allows me to have options for the mood i am in. the sound setting doesnt work so well unless the music is really blasting tho. other than that, they are great. I bought about 10 boxs for my PT. The top of my PT would make a flutering sound when driving, not no more. Also road sounds dimed down some. When it rains, the top of my PT doesn't sound like a tin can anymore.... Works great, installed it on my motorcycle and also kept the high tone stock horn.  With both horns the sound is VERY loud, it will scare the crap out of any dummies that pull out in front of me now.85db stock horn91db stock horn + FiammIf you understand how decibel measurement works you will know that is a big increase in sound. 
Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. This fits not only the Ecotec, but newer VW TDI's with the canister filter.  Works great, relatively low profile and goes nicely on a 3/8&#34; drive.  I accidentally ordered three (fat fingered the cart), and sold one to a fellow VW driver and one to a guy with a GM. 
I've an Optima in my old Corvette that has now failed.  I've have read thru their warranty information.  It states that the battery must be returned to the selling dealer for warranty service.  It cannot be returned to Amazon for any reason.  Therefore my question is this:If the battery purchased thru amazon should require warranty service, how is this done and by whom? I have this wiper in my garage ready to install when my other wiper needs to be replaced.  I was a little disturbed that the box that the wiper came in was battered, but I examined the wiper and it looked ok.  I contacted Valeo about their warranty and was shocked to hear that I had to deal with the seller (Amazon) for warranty.  Amazon offers only thirty day returns and by the time I install the wiper, the thirty days will be up.  I think Valeo, a well known wiper blade manufacturer, should handle the warranty coverage on their products beyond the thirty days offered by Amazon.  I think Amazon agrees. I ordered one of these for my 2008 Saturn Vue. Package marked for 2008 Vue but item did not work. Contacted storefront who fullfilled order for Amazon and was referred to Curt mfg. to obtain return number. Then had to contact seller again. Got a refund but I purchased a replacement from a local dealer. Seller later reported a wrong item number was somehow in the package. 
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Inexpensive, yet works as good as the ones sold by Honda dealerships. Made true to specs and fits right into the slot on my Accord 2006.Will buy again. bought this for my 2004 honda crv.  fit perfectly and cleared the code.  easy to do just give the threads some wd40 
Don't buy this rear wiper for a 1st generation xB, it will NOT fit! Get OEM or a wiper from elsewhere! Perfect fit for rear wiper blade replacement on an 06 Equinox.  The opening for the J-Hook is big enough for you to slide the new wiper blade in without problems. Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlander 
As good as the factory original. Thanks for the tip from one of the other reviewers to drill a small hole in the top of the cap in order to attach the existing leash. (It doesn't come with one) The Tender Jr. does not come with a cigarette adapter so I cut this in half to make two. I purchased 2 lighter plugs for a buck each from China&#8230; with free shipping&#8230; and they are working fine. These aren&#8217;t an exact match with the Tender cables but they fit together OK and are easy to determine polarity with the wire colors. You can also just use this as an extension cord for your Tender. The description states a length of 12-inches&#8230; but it&#8217;s actually 14-inches tip-to-tip on the connectors. Nice item for the price and it&#8217;s made in Mexico. This tail bag easily attaches to the motor cycle. 4 straps with a loop on one end and a quick connect on the other.  Also there is one strap with quick connects on each end and all are adjustable length. good bag for the price.

Get OEM or a wiper from elsewhere! These worked for my 2005 jeep grand cherokee.  I like how these bulbs will replace any of the three rear lights. 
For the price, an excellent wiper. Now, I did just put them on so it depends on how long they stay good for, but so far they work very well. Why did I choose Rain-X? Because they were heavily advertised during a lot of Formula 1 races back in the day and that kinda stuck with me.NOTE: A lot of people seem to wonder what size blades fit their vehicle. Either do a quick google search, check your owner manual, or just get a tape measure and measure the length of each blade on your car. Typically the driver side blade is a bit longer by an inch or two. We got the universal-type wiper blade rather than the blade with a connector designed especially for our car. That means that the connector looks a little conspicuous -- bulky and out of place -- compared to the one on the old blade. It's not a big problem, but when there is not much to differentiate different replacement wiper blades, it may be a reason to try to get a version designed for your specific car.These wiper blades were easy to attach, and so far work fine. The studies I have read say all wiper blades tend to last about the same amount of time. It's hard to say how long these will last, but so far, so good. The blade is good. The materials, construction, and water removal are all good. I tried the C-19-UB on the passenger side of my GS350 and it worked as well as the 24" factory one on the driver side. The Anco blade is molded with a spoiler, which makes it similar in appearance to the factory wiper of the GS350 which is the holder and the refill assembly. I rate the product 3 stars for the high cost not justified by any additional benefit over the factory blade refill.There two points I wanted to make are:1. Attention must be paid to letters -OE or -UB at the end of the blade model. I suggest using the Amazon fit guide at the top of the product page or visiting Anco website to find specific models that will fit your vehicle. I ordered -OE blades thinking -OE stood for Original Equipment. My family owns and previously owned Toyota/Lexus cars and I am only familiar with the "cane handle" type of a windshield wiper arm. Anco -OE blades will not fit this type of connector. Additionally, the Product Description says that the blade has an "OE-style spoiler", so it is even more confusing what OE in the model number refers to. Anyway, Toyota and Lexus have a "cane handle" type wiper arm and only blade models ending in -UB will fit this connector.2. I think these replacement blades are just too expensive. I usually buy wiper blade refills at the dealer for about ten dollars for two. These blades cost two to three times that (depending on the availability of a rebate). I tried a C-19-UB alongside with the factory 24" blade on my GS350 and I did not find Anco blade to clean the windshield any better than the factory blade does. On one of my previous cars, I tried Valeo 900 Ultimate blades (similar to Anco Contour). I had the same opinion that, although these replacement blades work well, they do not work better than factory refills, and their high cost makes them unappealing to me. I do not find that at 2-3 times the cost of factory refills, these blades work 2-3 times better. 
The rain x water repellant is the best for repelling rain. It does a great job. When you drive on the highway in stormy weather, there is no need for windshield wipers. The best repellant by far this stuff is amazing, works perfectly, Gas stays very functional all winter, in the boat, Lawn mower, and i use it in the snow blower over the summer.  fantastico keep my bike outside for a couple of days in a row during the summer, this has protected my f4i from all weather including a hurricane(could not drive through it) Fits great and does not blow off 
I think this was my fault for not reading every line of the description before buying.  I saw words like wide range and universal and biting teeth...  What I missed was that it works from 3 1/8 to 3 7/8 inches... I am sure I'll use it, just not as much use as I'd hoped it would get. Even after reading the reviews I ordered them anyway. Everybody seemed to complain about their short life--me, I'm underwhelmed with their dazzling brilliance--they're nice and White and _M_A_Y_B_E_ 15% brighter than stock bulbs in my Avalon. If I had to buy bulbs over again I would NOT get these regardless of how long they last. Review in one word: "overrated". Like title says I bought them to replace the wimpy locking acknowledgement/alarm horn with this low tone American truck sounding that is also louderThe only downside I can think of, it is considerably larger and I had to cut the factory harness to attach it.I'm buying a second set for my dads Silverado. His horn just crapped out on himWould give 5 stars if it was louderPS I bought them &#34;used&#34; but were like new. no signs of wear at all. just got a cheaper price 
Its enough to have a single button meep meep horn on my car, but mine was far worse than that.....it sounded like a tired meep. My sister laughed, my girlfriend laughed...heck even i laughed after i pressed the button when someone cut me off (initially i was pissed and after pressing the button i couldn't help but too laugh).I bought these after hearing them on youtube on a Honda FIT/Jazz and seeing the price that they were asking for it on amazon.The package comes with 2 horns, 2 nuts, 2 male spades(for 2 wire installs) and very basic instructions on how to connect the relay.One Saturday, 5 dollars(in wire connectors,nuts and bolts and some wire), 3 hrs of my precious time (kinda connected them wrong but realised before I fed them any power and test fitting for the second location is a B) and i have a whole new level of respect :)They sound great. I cannot attest to how loud they are but my family gave me the nod of approval for the sound that is now being produced.Will update after 3 people decide to cut me off again (if they decide) I was apprehensive because of the reviews with people saying theirs only worked once.. But I get the feeling that they didn't understand how the thing works. You can easily damage the components by using it wrong. You pump the thing 3-4 times per quart, but you don't want to sit and pump while you're removing the fluids, that isn't how it works. Pump it a 3-4 times and wait for it to get done, then do it again. It goes pretty fast! I did my brakes, trany, oil, power steering, transfer case, and differential before pulling the plug to get the rest and not make a mess and radiator fluid on a couple different vehicles.. went smoothly. I recommend buying a half inch hose clamp for the rubber reducer. This has to be one of the easiest do-it-yourself car maintenance projects. It took about 30 seconds to snap off the old wiper & clip on the new one. The hardest part is figuring out how to take off the old wipers & that's easy too.The installation instructions are pictorial; no words. There are no buttons to snap; just slide the metal "J" shape clip over the wiper mechanism.The wipers work well; no streaks & no blowing around at highway speed.There is something about the rubber these are made of; they stink to high heaven!  I was sneezing & my nose was running while putting these on so I guess I had some kind of allergic reaction?  It took a good soap scrubbing to get the smell off my hands.  I've never experienced this with wipers before.  It really doesn't matter once they are on the car since I don't spend time sitting on my windshield & the smell has dissipated after a few days.

Sometimes it works fine, then randomly stops working all together.  Mute button only works when I hold it down and it cycles on and off... I have to release it and hope it stops on mute.  Volume works for about 4 notches, then won't go back down.  Also, I need to push the buttons really hard to make this thing respond.  Before it was just a light touch.  This thing is irritating and frustrating.  Go with the Axxess ASWC, same price, doesn't need to go though a complicated program process, and actually works! 
Cobra CPI-A4000BC 4-AWG Heavy-Duty AC Power Inverter Cable KitWas cheaper to buy the already made kit than make your own. Fantastic price for a very handy tool in the garage!  When working on automotive and motorcycle accessories one needs to &#34;power them up&#34; to test them or their function and this power source provides the juice required.  You can also use auto accessories having the standard cord and cigarette lighter plug, e.g. CB radio, car vac, inflator, etc.  I use mine for testing lighting and accessories I install. The INNOVA 3320 Auto-Ranging Digital Multimeter is a good meter, especially for the price. It's well made, and has features usually found in more expensive meters. Batteries are included which is good. Having to remove screws and take the meter apart to replace them, not so much. The test leads are OK. The rubber holders on the meter do a very poor job of holding them when not in use, but it's not a big deal. There is no case of any kind included. The meter seems fairly accurate. The Auto-Ranging can take a few seconds to stabilize, and there is no manual override. Overall this is a very good meter for use around the home, or the "garage mechanic". Professional mechanics will probably want buy a meter that costs more than $20 though. The INNOVA 3320 Auto-Ranging Digital Multimeter is a great value, and I recommend it. 
High quality filter, just like the numerous K&N; filters I've purchased over the years.  Got it from the Amazon Warehouse deals and an awesome price too (about the price of 2 of the cheapest paper filters you can buy).  Fits perfectly in the stock airbox of my 02 Chevy Avalanche.Did I notice any fuel mileage or performance increases?  Of course not...its a nearly 6000lb truck and this is just an air filter. Used this on a 2005 Camry. This filter is exactly the same as factory. The triple layering filter technology is only found here. This is the only replacement filter I recommend. And at 10 bucks off dealer price. It can't be beat. I was tired of my RV batteries not correctly maintaining charge. Had used other "Bargain Brand" chargers with poor results. Seems to be working fine. I use it to maintain two 6 volt batteries wired in series. I am monitoring the price of this item and plan to buy another if and when the price drops. (Easy to do if you leave one in your Amazon Cart.Steve 
Didn't need but cleaned up threads anyway.  Works for o2 sensors on my diamante and the small one works for my trooper.  Cheap tool that when needed is hard to find locally. If your working with spark plugs you need this. As standard as they come and guaranteed to work.  Helped me gap my plugs with no problems. If you don't know how to use, just youtube it. Using this to keep the charge up on my battery for my camper and doing an excellent job so far.  The true test will be this spring when everything is hooked up again.

YOU  CAN  GET IT ON HERE OR ANY PART STORE, I  HAVE MADE MANY PEOPLE JUMP  DUE  TO THE SOUND OF  THE  HORNS  LOUDNESS. I've got a sport bike that doesn't have any storage.Before, I had a smaller disc lock made by someone else, but the internals on it always locked up - even when I had the key.So, I got this one, wanting something better.This one is too big to mount in the little spot I had before.It came with a little nylon carry bag, and I tried mounting that to the motorcycle, but it didn't stay. I took it off before it fell off and I lost the lock.Now, if I plan to go somewhere that I want to lock up the motorcycle (Wal-Mart or some sketchy bar), I will tuck this into the pocket of my riding jacket if I remember it. The problem is, I have never remember it.I've never gotten any use out of it, yet there it sits: Brand new and never flawed.

Sometimes it works fine, then randomly stops working all together.  Mute button only works when I hold it down and it cycles on and off... I have to release it and hope it stops on mute.  Volume works for about 4 notches, then won't go back down.  Also, I need to push the buttons really hard to make this thing respond.  Before it was just a light touch.  This thing is irritating and frustrating.  Go with the Axxess ASWC, same price, doesn't need to go though a complicated program process, and actually works! We bought and installed extras of these on our RV, just because the manufacturer never seems to put them in convenient places.  I want to pull into my site, and sit right in my seat at the leveling controls and do everything right there.  I installed extra level bubbles around the driver so all my rough leveling is done, and THEN I can walk around and fine-tune it at the back.My only warning to buyers:  make SURE you have them exactly where you want them before pressing on.  They DON'T move or come back off.  It's actually difficult to set them prefect on the first try because they stick so well.  Use a good carpenter's level to get the RV straight, then hold these steady with both hands and place CAREFULLY.  I'm kinda shaky so I really had to brace my hands on the RV while setting them. I have it hooked up to the SUV.  This actually works and will kick on every other day or so just to top off the battery.  It does get VERY warm when recharging a low battery so be careful where yo set it down...8-2013 UPDATE. The button to change the type vehicle its attached to starting NOT to work, no matter how hard you pushed on the button. It was returned directly to CTEK and replaced without incident (of course I had to pick up shipping to them).. 
Very good and loud,I replaced my original horn on my Yamaha V-Star 650 Classic with this horn,used same bracket and just plugged it into factory horn wires.Now it sounds more like a truck instead of a VW bug.People notice this horn!Great price too. Installted this horn kit on my wife's truck after my son installed small car horn in it (beep beep).  Now her truck sounds like a truck should and is plenty loud.  I wish the low frequency horn had a lower frequency, but it is acceptable. These horns are just the ticket in replacing stock inferior horns. These are a much nicer sounding horn than the loud blast of an air horn. Perfect horns to boost the warning ability of your vehicle without sounding like a Big Rig. 
So my wife's 00 Jeep Cherokee horn was getting a bit sad.  Living in NYC the horn gets tons of use.  I have a similar model on my 02 Miata as small cars tend to get ignored.  This version has a slightly different sound but the volume is the same.Have someone in front of you talking on their cell and not paying attention?  Give them a 2 second blast of this and watch them literally jump out of their seat and drop their phone.Pedestrian with headphones walking in front of your car when you have a green light?  I used to lock up the brakes quickly and watch them duck and cover when they heard the tires skidding, but alas, ABS you ruined my fun.  Now I have it back again.  Give the person a blast of this "bad boy" and once again literally watch them jump out of their skin.  Think of it as doing them a favor as maybe next time they'll look before crossing.Some rude person trying to cut into your traffic clogged merge lane at the very last possible moment, the one that you've patiently been waiting in forever?  Again, give them a 2 second blast on this horn and they'll think they're about to get rammed by a semi.Installation was easy as pie.  Hardest part was crawling under the bumper.  Kit came with everything needed. This is a neat little tool and it has come in handy around the shop.  The red laser dot serves as a toy for my dog to chase around. These things are super cool. Makes having 3 different hitches a time of your life you'll look back at with shame. 
Very good sound dampener it makes my trunk sounds very smooth and not rattly. I have my entire trunk lined with this stuff and all you can hear from the outside is true bass no rattling. This is a neat little tool and it has come in handy around the shop.  The red laser dot serves as a toy for my dog to chase around. I bought about 10 boxs for my PT. The top of my PT would make a flutering sound when driving, not no more. Also road sounds dimed down some. When it rains, the top of my PT doesn't sound like a tin can anymore.... 
If you ride every day or once a month you need this product. It will save you from having to call a tow truck, cold cranking problems in the morning and buying a battery every time you ride after a long winter. Have been using a Battery Tender charger(s) for years. One for the Harley and another for the boat and they always start. Bought this to share with the riding mower so its ready to go in the summer. Can be left on all the time with no damage to the battery. squeep-squeep-thunk.thunk-snack, thunk-snack.knock-whack, knock-whackkveetch-chit-chit-crunk-snitBut why belabor the point.  Worked well for about six months, then started smearing a little, and the noises got more interesting over time.  And intolerable.Back to Bosch for me. 
Easy to install, setup, wire up and use.  Its nice to have one connection point and be able to plug pin what ever kind of trailer you might want to tow. It works great with my camper, snow mobile trailer, ATV trailer and my old beater gravel, dirt and construction material trailer.Installation:  If you have a 4 wire harness already installed (like I did) you can just plug into that for all the lights, blinkers and brake lights, then simply add a break controller for trailer breaking  and connect to the wiring on the multi tow adapter. It also has pass through power connections for your attached trailer- which is great for charging your camper batteries while driving down the road.  We used this feature all summer while dry camping (camping with out plug in power) all over the midwest United States. The Wolo Model BA-97 Heavy Duty Commercial Grade Back-Up Alarm is perfect for the rear of any RV of size.  It&#8217;s small ( about 3 wide x 3&#8221; tall and 2&#8221; deep) and loud enough to alert anyone you are backing.  The sound is exactly like what you hear on garbage trucks and many commercial vehicles.Wiring the unit is simple and one of the mounting bolt/screw holes automatically grounds the horn to the vehicle chassis. I used the backup light wiring in the truck to trailer cable that was not used by my trailer to get the 12 Volt positive voltage to the trailer.  I then connected to the trailer wiring block using a14 gauge &#8220;hot&#8221; lead to take the voltage to the backup alarm mounted on the read of the trailer.  Whenever I have the trailer attached to the truck and then shift the truck into reverse Bingo.  The alarm begins beeping.  Of course anytime the truck backup lights are activated, like using the key fob to shut off the truck burglar alarm, the backup horn activates for about 30 seconds. The Battery Tender Ring Terminal Harness is very handy for charging a battery that is not easily accessible.  It allows you to install the ring terminal harness on the battery terminals once, and then just plug the extension cable into it when needing to charge or maintain the battery.The length of the harness cable to the quick-disconnect feature is adequate for easy access when needing to plug into the battery charger without having to disassemble anything on the vehicle once it is installed.  The dust cover provides protection to the quick-disconnect terminals and it keeps them from getting dirty, or wet when you are riding, driving, or boating.The Ring Terminal Harness is a very handy item for being able to quickly connect or disconnect the battery charger. 
Bought this to install with an aftermarket Kenwood Navigation 7120 on my 08 Toyota Tacoma.  It took several hours to install, but it works great with the wheel controls in my Toyota. This connector fit my CRV perfectly and made the wiring ofr a new hitch receiver a snap. I am pleased that Honda had the plugs already attached to the harness and that Curt used that setup to make this easy for me. Great quality and the welded on nut makes it easy to install or remove.  Fits a 2012 ninja 1000 and er6n 
GLAD  I  WENT  WITH  THE  CHROME AND  NOT  THE BLACK ONE, I  HOOKED  THIS ONE UP TO  MY GV1400 MOTORCYCLE IF  YOU  HAVE JUST  A  LITTLE  KNOW  HOW YOU CAN  DO  IT YOUR SELF , ALL  YOU WILL NEED TO GO WITH THIS IS A RELAY THAT DOES NOT COME WITH IT. YOU  CAN  GET IT ON HERE OR ANY PART STORE, I  HAVE MADE MANY PEOPLE JUMP  DUE  TO THE SOUND OF  THE  HORNS  LOUDNESS. I have a GM 1995 OBDI engine and the adapter they shipped for GM did not fit my connector so I had to return the whole unit.  I'm now back to grounding out the data pin and watching the flash code on the check engine light for trouble codes.  It's important to check your adapter fit before purchase since that's what you will rely on to get the data into the unit.I liked the unit's design - it came in two zipper bags that zipped together to hold the cables and adapters in one bag and hold the tool and book in a separate pouch.  You can also unzip one zipper and lay them side by side to go in a tool box drawer.I wish the adapter would have fit my vehicle - if it did I would have kept this unit because of all the features it offers. What can I say it's an air filter for a car, it fit and came in a box.  Nuff said 
I ordered this for a 2002 mercedes e320. This unit has to be connected to the swi-can to allow the steering wheel functions to work with an aftermarket head unit. The swi-can connects to the can harness and the swi-jack connects to the radio. It was fairly easy to install and the controls of my alpine head unit work from the wheel. I was told by crutchfield that there was no way to utilize the steering wheel controls on the e320 with the alpine radio. I am glad I found out about the swi-can and the swi-jack.The swi-jack was somewhat difficult to program at first. The thing to keep in mind is that the unit has preset functions so you have to either use each one with a button on the wheel, or skip it as the instructions say. There are some YouTube videos showing how to program it, that are helpful. I used this controller to replace the horrible factory dodge controller in my 2010 ram 2500. This controller is worlds ahead of the factory controller in terms of features and available settings. If you are hauling a large trailer it is a must have. The boost function is a great feature that applies the trailer brakes ahead of the truck brakes. You can set boost to 3 levels to meet your desired brake feel. My fiver weighs around 2500lbs more than my truck and between this controller and the exhaust brake stopping is effortless. Consider this...  The combine cost of your tow vehicle and trailer...  The combine weight of your tow vehicle and trailer...  The fact that your trailer may well weigh more than your tow vehicle...  And that moron that just jumped in your lane then slammed on his brakes...  This is NOT the time to think to yourself, "maybe I should've gotten a better brake controller."  Seriously, when the difference in cost is under $100, is it really not worth buying the best?I've used the Tekonsha P3 for two and half years now and I have nothing but praises to sing!  Features, user friendliness, and results!  This unit has it all.  First lets talk about the mechanism.  It uses a digital G-Sensor as apposed to a physical pendulem.  Why is this a benifit?  Because there are no downhill issues that you see with the physical and analog type sensors.  Prior to digial sensors, the downhill slope would throw off the pendulem and the brake controller either would send a weaker current to the brakes or none at all.  Some people have questioned the reliablity of digital sensors.  But with more than 10 years of full production digital units, complaints are actaully less than the older analog units.  Consider this as well, the sensor is not only quicker but more accurate as well, hard to soft braking is much safer now.  How does it work?  Just like any other accelerometor...it senses the volume deceleration and then computes an appropriate voltage and current to send to the trailer brakes based on a percentage of the user's max output setting.Let's talk interface.  A four button face with a roughly 1.5" LCD display plus a belly mounted manual switch.  With no brakes connected, this unit will dispay the default "Tekonsha Screen".  Once brakes are connected via the trailer plug, the unit will display the "Tow Screen".  It has a large two/three read out that displays 0.0 as a default.  While sitting still and once brake pressure is applied it will jump to approximately 10% of the max set output, after 3 seconds of being stationary it will move up to 25% power.  This is designed to "hold" the trailer if stopped on an incline or decline.  Setting the max brake power is a snap with the two "Up" and "Down" buttons on the left side of the face.  The value moves up and down by 0.1 increments and quite quickly if you hold the button down.  The last two buttons are "boost" and "page" which I will discuss when I talk features.  The last button is the manual brake override.  This bottom mounted spring loaded slider switch will manually add braking power to the trailer brakes (up to the user set max) even without depressing the vehicles brake peddle.  This is a standard feature on all brake contorllers, but I wanted anyone looking for their first brake controller to understand what this was.  Lastly, is the warning screen.  It's a deep red screen with a trailer and a "no" sign.  This indicates that the controller which had previously sensed brakes connected no longer can sense them.  Generally an indication of a poor trailer connection at the wiring harness or a problem with the brakes themsleves.Let's talk features.  I've mentioned the "Boost" button, but what is it?  There are 4 levels of boost for trailer brakes.  Off, LV. 1, LV. 2, & LV. 3.  Boost adds a brief (fraction of a second) burst to the trailer brakes which slows the trailer slightly more than the normal pressure would and keeps it from bumping or pushing the tow vehicle when brake pressure is initailly applied.  Very important if as many are these days, your trailer weighs more than your tow vehicle.  After the burst it returns the voltage and current to the G-sensors reccomended output.  There isn't a real scientific method for figuring what you need to use.  The picture on the home screen shows LV1 as small trailer, 2 as a med tailer, and 3 as a large trailer.  My trailer is a 6K lb. TT and I just leave it on the default LV. 1 boost.  Everytime the units is powered it returned to the default LV. 1.  The unit will power down after 15 mins with no trailer connected AND no input from the brake signal wire.  The "Page" button will take you to a second screen that you navigate with the "up", "down", and "Boost" (now "enter") buttons.  This sceen has some cool features as some useful features.  "Backlight" allows you to brighten or dim the brightness of the display.  "Color" lets you set the color of the display.  (Yeah I know, unessesary, but cool)  The default color is "White" which is more of a light blue.  There's also Magenta, Orange, Dk Blue, Violet, Lt. Green, and Dk. Green.  Red is not availible as it's reserved as a warning color for the "no trailer connection" warning screen.  Back to the page screen.  There's also a VERY USEFUL troubleshooting screen.  It lets you view diagnostics on the fly and over the road that can give you four digit readouts of battery voltage, stoplight (brake input signal) voltage, brake voltage, and brake current.  This screen alone is worth the cost of this brake controller!  When you first connect your tailer do some tests and record the max input you set, the output under normal braking conditions, as well as the brake voltage and amperage.  If down the line you get the feeling the brakes aren't working properly, you can re-run this test and see if it's an electrical problem or not.  Finally when your done, pressing the page button will return you to the "tow screen."Installation.  A snap for anyone that has a factory tow package.  Tekonsha offers plug and play wiring harnesses that plug into most make and model years of trucks.  If you have to have it installed or choose to install it yourself as I did, it can be challenging.  But it's a simple four wire hookup.  A 12V input from the battery (running thru a 30A auto reset breaker NOT a fuse), an output to the brake pin of your 6 or 7-way trailer connector, a stoplight input running to your vehicle's stoplight switch behind the brake peddle, and lastly a frame ground.  The mount can be a little challenging to install because of the akward access to the screws, but it can be mounted at nearly any angle other than strait up or down and provided the face is facing a close to directly rearward as possible.All in all, this is probably the most important review I've ever done.  This controller will save you grief and keep you and your vehicle safe.  Make sure for your safety, your families safety, and the safety of all those on the road you buy the brake controller that does it's job the best.  Buy the Tekonsha P3. 
Does what it says it does......looks great ! It does what it is supposed to and suds up. You buy it and you stick it on the end of your kick stand. Add a little E-6000 and it will stay on.It does a great job, even in quicksand. 
It does what it is supposed to do, that is to increase placement distance from the car to the electrical outlet The 3rd generation powerprobe includes a number of changes for additional flexibility.  In short, it is a vehicle powered DVM with both a 20 foot cable and an additional 20 foot extension giving you a 40 foot working range around either the battery terminals or cigarette lighter outlet, both clips and a plug are included in the kit.With the series 3 units they use a hard gold plated banana jack to hold the removable probe or cables to extend your reach.  If you purchase the accessory kit, it includes piercing probes that self center on a conductor, pierce the insulation, and attach to the jack allowing you to tap a wire at any point to locate intermittant problems.While the DVM is backlit all the time, it also has 2 bright white LEDs facing forward to aid in finding and probing terminals in dark places.  The actual probe is hardgold plated with a sharp tip and removable at the banana jack.  Another identical probe is included with a screw-in female banana jack in the accessories kit to retrofit the powerprobe I and II units to accept external cables and probes.If you need to excite a circuit with a connection to battery ground or to battery positive, the switch allows a momentary connection to bridge the probe tip to either voltage which is useful in testing relay driven circuits, indicator lights, and other small current loads.  The prope voltage is always displayed during testing on the meter. The voltage/ground switch is circuit breaker protected in case you accidentally drive 12 volts into a chassis ground.  Additionally, since the switch takes abuse it is easily replaced if it fails with just a screwdriver.Combined with the testlead set, the powerprobe 3 greatly simplifies testing of vehicular wire and big rigs up to a single trailer.  The DVM has 5 selectable modes of operation designed for different problems.  Reading the manual is important to get the full value from this meter.Although the price is a little high, the design and construction quality are excellent.  Enough wire is provided to check running lights on trailers or to look for blown fuses.  All of the wiring is exceptionally flexible and heavily insulated with top quality connectors.  Both the tester and accessories come in hard plastic cases that can be stowed in a service box.Not mentioned in specifications is that although the probe runs from 12-24 VDC, the meter can be used to measure voltages up to 80VDC. I used this controller to replace the horrible factory dodge controller in my 2010 ram 2500. This controller is worlds ahead of the factory controller in terms of features and available settings. If you are hauling a large trailer it is a must have. The boost function is a great feature that applies the trailer brakes ahead of the truck brakes. You can set boost to 3 levels to meet your desired brake feel. My fiver weighs around 2500lbs more than my truck and between this controller and the exhaust brake stopping is effortless. 
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. IT WORKS This fits not only the Ecotec, but newer VW TDI's with the canister filter.  Works great, relatively low profile and goes nicely on a 3/8&#34; drive.  I accidentally ordered three (fat fingered the cart), and sold one to a fellow VW driver and one to a guy with a GM. 
I bought this to do the brakes on my Porsche and it does not working very well it's too fat to fit in the space. I required an ammonia-free window cleaner for my tinted windows. This does the job quite nicely. It isn't how well it does, rather how safely it does it. This is designed to work with the Valterra bayonet fitting on your Gray or Black water dump valve and it does just that... 
This product does not work exactly how Lucas says it does. I used this in a Detroit engine that was not burning oil before I used it but afterwards was.I have talked with many drivers (truck drivers) who have used this with the same results. I will never touch another Lucas product. This stuff is a sham and a waste of a Drivers hard earned money. If you want to do something good for your engine use Synthetic engine oil. Put this in a Envoy XUV with 17,500 original miles hoping to maybe squeeze a little MPG's based on the other reviews I read here on Amazon.  What a crock !  Did nothing remotely close to lowering temp.  Just lowered my pocket book by $28 and change because I bought 2 bottles based on Purple's rep. I had e-mailed telling me 1oz per quart of capacity.  Figured I would then put the rest in my wife's Accord.  Temp is actually higher !  I e-mailed rep back and here is what he said :I'm sorry that you having noticed a temperature drop as of yet, but Purple Ice will not cause an increase in operating temperature.  Was this vehicle running hot to begin with?  If so, was the root cause investigated?No radiator additive will cause an a thermostatically controlled cooling system to run consistently colder than the thermostat set-point.  The thermostat is there to help the engine warm up quickly be restricting coolant flow until the coolant reaches a certain temperature.  That is its function.  If the coolant goes below that set-point the thermostat closes and the coolant begins to increase in temperature until the t-stat opens again.If you were not having overheating problems, why did you purchase and use a product that is intended to alleviate overheating problems?  The product works as exactly advertised.  If you would like the vehicle to run colder that the current t-stat set-point you may try installing a cooler t-stat.  Purple Ice will help you vehicle achieve this lower temperature after the mechanical restrictions to such an end are removed.In my opinion FALSE ADVERTISING and a SNAKE OIL product BEWARE. I used this is a 2008 Freightliner with a Detroit engine. The engine was in good shape but I just had to try it. It did nothing. Snake oil I tell ya. Pure Snake oil. 
Want peace of mind?  Use this fluid.  In my cars, I installed after-market transmission pans with extra capacity, cooling fins, and drain plugs.  Look into Mag Hytec pans.  Plan on doing heavy duty work?  Hauling?  Towing?  Imagine sitting at idle in stop & go traffic.  I've also installed aftermarket transmission coolers with their own built-in electric fans.  Amazon carries B&M;, Derale, & Flex-A-Lite.  Keep an eye on that ATF dipstick, and change the fluid as needed.  For those of us that believe you can't do too much maintenance or "over change" your fluids, then draining the pan once a year and topping off with 5-8 quarts is perfect.  Royal Purple is a great product.  It ranks right up there with Red Line, Mobil 1, and Lucas Oil.Differential CoverB&M; 70297 Hi-Tek Cooling System For Engine Oil Or Automatic Transmission FluidFlex-a-lite 4190 Remote 6-Pass Transmission Oil Cooler - 16,000 GVWDerale 13750 Atomic-Cool Remote Oil Cooler Most people change their motor oil regularly, but forget about the transmission fluid. I have a few collectible cars. I only use Royal Purple products. They are fully synthetic, not a BLEND like some others, and they have a great web site where you can find the EXACT fluid for your car's transmission. so many people use the wrong fluids. The transmission should last as long as your engine. The wrong fluid or not changing the fluid will ruin your transmission. I have used syhthetic fluids on my Toyota Camry for twenty years. It's a 1990. Still the same engine and automatic transmission. I also use synthetic power steering and break fluid which I change every year. That's why I use it on my other cars as well. Just be sure to check their site to be sure you are using the right fluid for your vehicle. That is a MUST! I used this for an oil change on a 2007 Saturn Vue Hybrid. I find it odd how the GM ecotec have the oil filter canister right below the exhaust manifold. This socket fits under it without a problem allowing it to have room to unscrew the filter out of the canister. Worth the buy if you ever plan on changing the oil in your GM Ecotec vehicle! Or just to have in general in case you ever get a friend to change your oil for you! 
Not much to say here except it is a plastic funnel about 5 inches in diameter with a long and flexible, see-through, plastic hose.  In my opinion this is a must have item for the vehicle trunk or truck tool box and this is one of acceptable quality and function. I was extremely disappointed in this item. Most of the Camco stuff I have is pretty good, but the problem with this meter is the clear plastic face is not static proof.When comparing with my Fluke multimeter, this meter reads about 2VAC high at 120VAC; or about 1.6% off.When you get the meter, it has a piece of protective plastic over the bezel, and just removing it will induce enough static electricity to cause the pointer to change.  And if you brush across the bezel with your finger, you can make it read anywhere from 110V to 130V, because the static electricity affects the needle.Most meters use a plastic bezel that is immune to static, and does not do this. I don't know if the problem is the plastic the manufacturer used or perhaps they failed to treat it with some chemical.Sadly there are not a lot of options for other brands. I like an analog meter in this case as you can see voltage fluctuations a whole lot better than you can with a digital meter.Hopefully over time this meter will lose it's sensitivity to static electricity. To be honest, there are tons of these gap gauges around, made by all sorts of different companies. I dont actually think that this gap gauge is any better than the others, but it does its job, so it deserves 5 stars. On top of that, im dealing with iridium plugs, so you would need a gap gauge like this to do the job right. (the coin gap gauge will damage your precious metal!!!)Great stuff overall! 
Put these GL-4 fluid into my 350Z manual 6sp transmission, it shifts smoothly and also coast nicely without gear jerk or backlash.  I normally use Mobil-1 engine oil and differential GL-5 gear oil for most of my vehicle but this time Red Line carries GL-4 while most other manufacturer don't have it.  Very impress with this product and would recommend for everyone who needs GL-4 for their synchromesh transmission. Definitely it's not cheap but much cheaper than replace your transmission.Most important is GL-4 fluid is thicker viscosity than GL-5 which provides better protection for your transmission synchomesh as suggested from manufacturer user manual. This is the first time I change transmission fluid in my 350Z with 100K miles, no metal shavings observed. With Red Line synthetic fluid, I don't have to worry for anther 100K miles. No problems with the oil, but what makes it so much better then regular mobile 1 full synthetic ?Why is this extended performance so much better ?Does that mean i can change oil less frequent ? This is the review I did when these filters were sold in "packs of 2" There are some mistakes which i will highlight in brackets.These filters (PL20195) were bought as a replacement for the Toyota filters that are found on the 2.5L D-4D diesel engine in the Toyota Hilux pickup truck. They are of a very high quality as judged by the sealing gasket, the anti-drain back valve and its weight.Filter is being used with Mobil 1 Delvac 15W-40 (edit: it was actually 5W-40) Fully Synthetic engine oil and the engine noise has certainly reduced from its previous dino based lubricant.In my country, the Toyota dealership(TTTL) charges about US$28 for one filter; purchasing online and having the filters shipped cost me about US$13 for one.I highly recommend this filter as a high quality replacement that doesn't break the bank or if you plan to extend oil drain intervals.Now the technical stuff for people that want to know:PL20195 = PL20064 minus the pressure relief bypass valve (exactly the same dimensions)PL20195 is a longer version of the PL10241PL20064 is a longer version of the PL10028 (edit: the PL10028 doesn't have an antidrainback valve)The larger the filter usually means:1)that it takes longer for the oil pump to fill it.2)that there is more filter medium to trap more contaminants out of your oil3)that the oil will pass through the filter medium slower4)theoretically that a higher RPM will be required to activate the filter bypass valve (which means that you can rev your engine slightly higher without the oil bypassing the filter medium) - this really depends on the PSI that the pressure relief valve was designed with, but if a small filter and a larger filter have the same PSI value for the "relief" then this theory should hold true.Today the filter is currently being used with Shell Rimula R4 15W-40 for 8000Km oil change intervals 
THIS IS THE PERFECT TIRE PRESSURE GAUGE FOR CHECKING TIRE PRESSURE ACCURATELY, QUICKLY AND EASILY.  SIMPLY PUT THE END OVER THE VALVE STEM, HOLD IT FIRMLY FOR A SECOND OR TWO AND READ THE PRESSURE.  THE GAUGE ON THE NEW TIRE PUMP IS NOT CORRECT AND NEITHER IS THE PRESSURE GAUGE ON THE ELECTRIC TIRE PUMP THAT ATTACHES TO THE CIGARETTE LIGHTER. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE ACCUTIRE MS DIGITAL TIRE PRESSURE GAUGE. I use it for my dual back tires in a Ford 350 chassis. It would not register the tire pressure accurately. It was hard to get a tight seal around the valve stem. I will try the CH tire inflater with the built in gauge and the chuck that hopefully will get a tight seal on the valve stem. I had a time trying to keep the connections from leaking. As you tighten the connector on it would torque the hose and it would unwind and loosen the connector causing a leak. I ended up putting a pressure regulator on that had a rotating connector. It allowed the hose to untorque itself without unscrewing the connector. 
I need this pump for every 100k miles when I change differential oil. There are two holes: bottom one is for oil drain and the top bolt is for oil fill. I use this pump to pump Gear oil using the top fill hole up to the point that oil will sip out. I don't think I can do it without this pump. I think there are a lot of complaints here about the tube is not long enough. Maybe they are right. But for me, it fits perfectly with my Acura Tsx. I use this pump to pump transmission oil that has draining bolt at odd location. Even with the lift, I had to drop two bolts that hold the plastic cover underneath the car. Even so, I had about a foot room and the draining bolt was about three feet inside. Saying that, I didn't have much room to work with, and when the oil was out, it spread to everywhere. Besides, when I put the two bolts back in, they were stuck so I had to tie the plastic up with tie rap. I don't mind working under the car, it's just didn't make sense.With this pump, I have no problem pumping the transmission oil out in about 15 minutes. I re-fill with about 3 quarts of oil and take the pump to dump station and dump it right at the station. I also pump the power steering oil and brake oil out and replace with new oil which I didn't plan to do for many years. There is no way to flush the transmission oil out anyway, so even with draining oil, the steps are still the same, which is fill and try every 3 quarts until the oil is clean (redness) (normally after 3 times).While I like the idea to use this for engine oil change, I rather use the draining bolt and only use this for transmission oil to avoid the inconvenience.Overall, it meets my expectation. I don't know why I did not get this sooner but it works very well in filling the fresh water tank in my fifth wheel trailer.. the shut off valve is nice to have at the nozzle so I can easily shut it off the moment I hear that it is full.. 
Pretty dam heavy duty, has the air bleed screw at the top.I inserted a half used tube of grease cartilage, the royal purple 14.5 oz, no issue primed it following the instructions and its oozes out with ease I have used these every time I replace my old plugs. I tried a different brand ONCE and it was a big mistake. This brand is specifically what the owners manual and shop manual state you need to use. For $2 a plug, Amazon is by far the cheapest place to get them. Packaging is the usual. Gap part of the plug is wrapped with a TP roll tube from a mouses house, then plugs placed individually in a tiny cardboard box, then the plugs placed in a bigger box lined with air bags. I purchased this to try to remove the adhesive left over from the Lamin-x on my headlights.  Luckily i tried this on a corner of the headlight before i doused the entire thing.  Within a few seconds, it had turned the clear lens a cloudy white.  I ended up having to use a restoration kit and sanding away the white part.On the other hand, I used it to clean an area before I applied some double sided tape and it worked very well!  Just before you use it, test it on a small piece first. 
A good, OEM replacement fuel filter for many Ford vehicles. Often overlooked as routine maintenance, fuel filters can (without warning) become clogged and, in turn, lead to vehicle reliability issues. This is especially true up norh, where seasonal mixes of gasoline affect the fuel system differently. Additionally, if you utilize E-85 ethanol in your vehicle, than you should be replacing these things more frequently than you may be used to. A final thought to extend the life of your new Motorcraft fuel filter...don't pump gas at station that is currently being re-fueled by a fuel tanker, as deposited fuel tank sediment can be stirred up in the process. At this price I could not pass it up. This is what is recommended my car manufacture (hyundai). The Gasoline direct engines build carbon very fast and need fuel cleaner every oil change. This 30W non-detergent oil is what you should use in your 4 cycle lawn mower or garden tractor.I have a garden tractor with a 26 HP Kohler engine and this 48oz is exactily how much the engine uses when you change the oil and filter. I like not having left over new oil. That lets me use the container for the used oil.  Ordering was convenient and shipping was fast. 
I can not beleive how GREAT this tool is. It makes oil changes a JOY, clean and easy. I have been changing oil in my cars for 35 years. I have lots of memories of laying on my back with oil running down my arm, or spilling oil out a pan or dropping the drain plug into a pan full of oil..... NO LONGER..... I am sure I am getting 99% of the oil out by going down dip stick hole.Once all the oil is out it is in spill proof contaner and easy to bring to the local tire/oil change/auto part place to recycle. I really love this tool.On my 2010 VW JSW (Jetta Sportwagen) TDI (Turbo Direct Injection Diesel) the Dealer wants $85 after all the tax and Haz Mat disposal. Although the recommend oil change interval are every 10K; I do it at about 6,500-7,500. Oil and filter are about $50. Money I save I can change oil more often.VW has a belly pan that requires 19 screws be removed.... to access the drain. It takes me 30 min from start to finish to change oil and filter with the Hydro-Turf Oil Extractor. It would be double that going from the bottom and a lot more messy.VW recommends you change the drain plug and crush washer everytime.... another $4 every oil change. The oil filter is on top of the engine in a canister so there is no need to get under the car. Also the oil filter is vertical and sits on top; the base of the oil filter housing has some deep pockets in the base. I used the hydro-turf oil extractor is great at getting every drop of oil out of the oil filter housing, a significant amount, at least 3 to 5 ounces of oil......  Again what little old oil remains is insignificant and with the ability to drain the oil filter housing, not possible with out an extractor, it is as good as drain from the bottom at the pan method in my opinion. Highly recommend. Pros:Generous supply in 32 oz bottleWorks in fuel or mixed with engine oilSmells pleasant (minty, clean)Keeps cold engine start-ups slick and quickCons:Thin lubricantThins out your oilIt is a solvent, it MIGHT (no facts to support that possibility yet) deteriorateyour gaskets, seals.Claims:Cleans out engine, plugs, valves, and injectorsMY recommended use:8 - 10 oz per oil change(they recommend 20% mmo with engine oil change. That's about a quart)4 - 6 oz per 12 gallon fuel tankAt first use, keep engine idle for 30 mins for complete mixup and soak in.Then you drive for 1 hour, then you can switch engine off. High qualilty oil filter. Has ck valve to prevent oil form draining out (great for my motorcycle...or any auto/engine to prevent oil starvation on start up)  Large filter media and high quality throughout. 
I receive the unit with a black power adapter not white color like the picture show. But no big deal!It comes with all mounting screws and 2 stripes of foam double side tapes. I will not use these tapes, these are some cheap foam type. I don't think it will hold for long. I use black 3M heavy duty exterior double side tape for mounting. I did not use screws because I mount the laser unit underneath the garage door opener. for ceiling mount screw is still the best! I use heat gun to warm up the these tape for mounting, it works like a glue!This unit comes with a mounting bracket, first you have to mount the bracket than hook the laser unit onto the bracket. however the laser unit is not secure on the bracket. It can come loose very easy! which mean it can fall onto your car. So, I add an electric tape at the back of the unit, now the unit stays!The red laser is bright and clear, it can be see clearly in day light. the laser will turns on and stay on about 2 to 3 minutes.9V battery for power outage backup is also a great feature!Great buy! Not the best. I put this in the back of my pickup, covered by a topper, to run a 12v cooler during the summer. I put groceries in the cooler from store to home.Instal is straight forward. The black wire grounds directly to the box with a sheet metal screw. I ran a hot from the battery + via 10ga to the red and spliced them together.The unit is one piece, plastic. I used body tape to stick this to the pickup box and drilled holes for two sheet metal screws. So far, it holds well and works. I get the feeling this will not last as long as I want as it seems a little cheaply made. Then again, it was cheap so I am not expecting great things from it. I only had a set of small metal chocks that came with the floor jack I have so I went with a chock with a little more size. I bought these and am very happy with them. A nice bright red/orange color for visibility, comes with a small rope loop to hang on the wall or pull out from tire placement and sturdy construction. It has rows of ridges to hold against the tire and on the bottom to prevent slipping. I'm sure the bottom ridges will work on soft surfaces but I'll have to wait until I use them to see if they slip or not on concrete / hard surfaces. I recommend this product. 
WHEN TO USE EPOXY CEMENTWhen you need a strong rigid workable (e.g. sandable and/or paintable surface) adhesive, particularly for use on metal or hard plastic, epoxy is usually the best choice.  Most epoxies dry with little running or shrinkage, and so are good for filling gaps.  The major drawback to epoxies is that they consist of two parts (resin and hardener) which must be mixed in small batches, and then applied with your own applicator (e.g., a toothpick or popsicle stick). Some are packaged in a dual-syringe--but that is not an adequate solution, because the components must still be manually mixed in order harden to maximum strength.WHEN TO USE JB-WELDJB-Weld is a very strong epoxy cement.  JB-Weld is the cement/glue of choice when joining metal parts or filling holes in metals.  Otherwise, ordinary epoxy cement or other types of cements/glues are usually better choices.  Some other reviewers have complained that the descriptive name "weld" is inappropriate---to some extent that's true.  JB Weld can do some jobs welding can't.  Conversely some simple welding jobs like joining two thin metal rods at right angles are difficult with JB Weld.HOW TO USE JB-WELDGeneral Principles: Although JB WELD makes an excellent filler---and can even be used to cast small parts, it is not remotely as strong as real metal used this way.  Whenever possible, use JB WELD as an adhesive---a very thin layer of JB WELD holding two pieces of metal together.  Always reinforce with metal pieces when possible.  For example, rather than building up a massive flange with JB Weld, you might be able to use scrap peice of metal to form most of the flange, held in place with JB Weld.  The greater the relative surface area of contact, the strong the bond will be.Surface Preparation:  As with any adhesive, the surface must be clean and rough.  Clean with a solvent (according to another reviewer, acetone is the best solvent for this purpose, but rubbing alcohol will work), roughen the surface, then clean with the solvent again.  Use a clean cloth for each application of solvent.  I generally use a small grinding wheel in a Dremel tool to roughen the surfaces.  You can also scratch the surface with a knife, or use coarse sandpaper, or both depending on the material.The solvent cleaning is for removing the LAST TRACES of oil from CLEAN surfaces.  If the parts are oily, even multiple cleanings with solvent may not be enough---you may redeposit oil from your cleaning cloth or as the solvent evaporates on the surface.  So, if you can detect any oil on any portion of the part, or if you have any doubt, clean it with a degreaser first.  If you do not have a commercial degreaser handy, a paste of laundry detergent and a stiff brush may do the trick.  Only when you are certain that there are no traces of oil is it time for the solvent cleaning(s).Joining Broken Parts: If you are joining broken parts, with a clean but irregular matching surfaces, limit the roughening to scratching with a wire brush or etching with an acid (but be sure to wash off all traces of the acid). Apply a THIN uniform layer of JB WELD, lightly clamp together hard enough to squeeze out any excess. Sometimes a thick rubber band is perfect. Often you can arrange pieces so that the weight of the top piece will hold the joint together until the JB Weld cures. Sometimes you can place a weight (such as a brick) on top to apply gentle pressure.  Do not remove the clamp or pressure until the JB Weld has cured completely.  After an hour or two, after the glue has set but is still soft, you can cut off any excess with a knife or razor---but if you don't need to cut the excess off, don't.  Often you can build-up the surfaces around a break for added strength.  Sometimes blue painters tape can be used to help hold pieces together while the glue sets, and/or to make a temporary stand to hold the pieces in the best orientation.ScotchBlue Painter's Tape for Multi-Surfaces 2090-.75A, 3/4 Inches by 60 Yards, 1 RollJoining Dissimilar Parts:  Minimize any gaps if possible, e.g., by sanding if possible so that the contact as perfect as possible.  If you will be filling substantial gaps, sometimes it is helpful to cover openings with blue painters tape to prevent the JB Weld from flowing away and leaving gaps.Joining Long Thin Parts (rods or sheets): Try to overlap if possible, or reinforce them with a similar overlapping peice of metal glued in place with JB Weld.  To join a 1/8" steel rod, to another 1/8" steel rod, forming a "T" (a common and easy welding job, almost impossible with just JB-Weld), cut two 1"-long "L's" from a heavy-paper clip, (or make L's from similar wire), and embed those with JB-Weld on opposite sides of the joint.  You can further strenthen the joint by wrapping fine steel wire around the rods holding the "L"s in place---before  covering it all with JB-Weld.  Be sure to thoroughly clean the rods and wires first (see below).  For small parts, or when wire wouldn't work well, unwaxed dental floss is remarkably strong, and can do an excellent job of reinforcing joints (when embeded in JB Weld). Ideally, apply the JB Weld, then wind the floss tightly into the soft JB Weld.Filling Holes:  Don't forget to prepare the surfaces as described above---even if you can only roughen the surfaces with an ice pick or awl.  JB Weld shrinks very little as it cures so fill the hole completely.  If it is possible to sand the surface when the JB Weld has hardened, then overfill the hole slightly.  Since JB Weld flows a little until it sets, the surface should be horizontal.  If not horizontal, you can apply the JB Weld and then cover the hole with blue painters tape until the JB Weld sets.  Depending on the job, it is often a better strategy to fill the gap as much as possible with a piece (or pieces) of metal embedded in JB Weld that a single mass of pure JB Weld.Reinforcing a leaking pipe:  Work JB Weld into a piece of fiberglass cloth or with a spatula, apply, and then add more JB Weld to any thin spots and to feather out the edges. You may have to apply several layers of the JB Weld-saturated fiberglass cloth. Sometimes wire cloth (window screening) can be used.Holes in car body panels etc:  If you can cover at least one side of the hole with a piece of sheet metal (held in place by JB Weld) that is a good strategy---the combination of pop-rivets and JB Weld often works especially well, even if you ultimately sand the heads of the pop rivets away.TEKTON 6555 Rivet Gun with 40-pc. RivetsMixing:  Follow the instructions.  A paper plate can be a good mixing surface; popsicle sticks are the best mixing tools.  Beware that you must use the same amount of resin and hardener, and they MUST be VERY thoroughly mixed.  Mix until you are certain that it is completely and thoroughly mixed, and then continue mixing for twice that time.  Seriously!!!Curing:  Follow the instructions, but wait longer than recommended: the longer you wait the stronger the bond.  A a day or two at 70 or 80 degrees is a reasonable MINIMUM.  Note that epoxies do not "dry"--there are no solvents to evaporate, instead a chemical reaction hardens the cement (a plastic resin).  Chemical reactions are proportional to temperature (the rule of thumb is that for each 10 degrees, the reaction speed doubles).  Using the rule of thumb, if it takes 1 day to cure at 80 degrees, then it takes 16 days to cure at 40 degrees, and that's only to minimally cured.  Okay, I know that waiting this long is not practical in many circumstances---you can probably get away with curing for 4 hours at 90 degrees (but don't go much higher than 90 degrees), and "take it easy" for a couple of days.WHEN TO USE OTHER EPOXIESFor materials other than metal, particularly for rigid plastics, other epoxies are usually better than JB Weld.  Some epoxies are clear, or white, or specialized for particular purposes.  For exampleCLEARBOND H-3S Clear Strong Epoxy Adhesive Syringe - .85ozWHEN TO USE QUICK-EPOXIESOrdinary (slow) epoxies (whether JB Weld or other epoxies) dry harder than quick epoxies and are generally the best choice.  Maximum strength is the whole point of epoxies--if you don't need maximum strength---you probably do not need epoxy.  Use quick epoxies when 1) the hardening speed is essential, 2) when the item cannot be supported in the required orientation while the epoxy sets (at least several hours), or 3) when you have to absolutely minimize flowage.  Super-glue is often a good alternative in such situations.WHEN TO USE OTHER CEMENTS OR GLUESWhile epoxies are ideal for a few specific uses (primarily when you need a rigid cement for metal or rigid plastic)--there are many situations when other types of glue are better choices.  Epoxies are generally NOT recommended for flexible surfaces, such as leather, wood, or flexible plastic, and generally do not adhere well to glass, etc.  While epoxies may work with porous surfaces (paper, wood, ceramics, etc.), other adhesives are usually better.White Glue: For most light-duty indoor household applications which do not have to be waterproof, ordinary household white glue is safe, cleanup is very easy, and in most cases repairs are redo-able if you make a mistake.  White glue shrinks a great deal as it dries, and so is not good for filling holes or large gaps.  For example:Elmer's All Multipurpose White Glue, 7 5/8 oz. (E379)Glue Stick: Think of glue sticks as thick white household glue in stick form.  Glue sticks are great with paper, but have few other applications.Avery Glue Stic, 0.26 oz, Pack of 6, (98095)Wood Glue: Carpenters's wood glue is essentially water-proof (when dry) white household glue.  It penetrates and strengthens the wood better than any other type of glue. It is safe, and cleanup is easy. If the joint breaks again (because the wood is weak), it can be re-glued. For example:Elmer's E701 Carpenter's Wood Glue 8-OunceGoop:  Goop will bond virtually any material, including leather, plastics, glass, and metal.  The bond is clear, VERY strong, waterproof, and hard but flexible.  Since Goop is clear, if a little extra oozes out, it is barely noticeable. I've used Goop to repair ceramic plant pots, water hoses, and shoes; to seal holes in air-mattresses, to close small holes in window screens, as plumbers paste in assembling plumbing parts, to  I also use it to seal rust spots on my dishwasher rack--the Goop it also makes a "cushioned" surface that will prevent scratches to dishes.  Goop is particular good for repairing damaged electrical cords.Amazing Goop All-Purpose Household Goop, 3.7-Ounce Tube #130012Silicon Glue: Silicon glue is best for glass, and when you want a truly flexible connection (for example, to absorb vibrations). It is a good alternative for Goop for general household use on glass, plastic, and metal when you do not need the maximum possible strength. It is safer than Goop, and cleanup is easier. Like Goop, silicon glue takes days to reach reasonable strength, weeks to reach maximum strength. For example:GE Silicone II Household Glue, 2.8 ozFabric Glue:Beacon Fabri-Tac Permanent Adhesive, 4-Ounceworks amazingly well on fabrics, saturating the surfaces enough to provide a very strong bond, but without soaking through.  Depending on the application, fabric glue can be better than sewing.  It remains very flexible, e.g., it would probably be great on leather or heavy vinyl (e.g., women's handbags, shoes, luggage, etc.)Super-Glue (Krazy Glue): Super-glue is very strong, rigid, and fast. In many ways it is similar to 2-minute epoxy---except that no mixing is required. Although very hard, super-glue is brittle, and so, is not recommended for flexible objects. Super-glue is hazardous in that it can easily glue fingers (etc.) together.  Previously, I used super-glue frequently on objects (e.g., jewelry) when a clear bond was required---however, Goop is better for such applications, safer, and more conveneient. Opened super-glue keeps poorly, even in tighly sealed glass containers---so I recommended packages of multiple very small tubes.BAZIC Super Glue, 3 grams 0.10 ounces, 6 Per PackLiquid Nails/Construction Adhesive:  When you need to permanently join a large amount of surface, of almost any kind, Construction Adhesive is usually ideal. If you need to join 2 2x4s to make a 4x4 Construction Adhesive is better than nails.  Most construction adhesives are slightly flexible, and so can even be used on leather (i.e., to repair a loose shoe sole), etc.  Construction adhesive may leave a stain on porous surfaces, and may stain-through thin surfaces.  For small projects, Goop is usually a better choice.Caulking Compound:  You can think of caulking compound as white household glue with alot of inert filler--to use when you need to fill holes.  As an adhesive, it is the weakest on this list, but is strong enough for many purposes when spread over a large surface, such as the back of a ceramic tile.  A few years ago, I made a brick column to support a mailbox.  Traditionally, I should have used mortar--which would have been very time consuming.  I could have used construction adhesive (albeit any excess that squeezed out would have been ugly)--but caulking compound was quick, cheap, looks good, and was more than adequate for the job. There is a large family of Goop adhesives, "All Purpose", "Automotive", "Craft", "Household", "Lawn and Garden", "Marine", "Plumbing", "RV", "Sport and Outdoor", and "Wood and Furniture"  As far as I can tell, all are identical.  Some varieties (such as Marine Goop) meant for outdoor use may be more UV resistant. So, at least for indoor use, I suggest buying the cheapest.  In the local hardware store, "Household Goop" is usually the cheapest.  At the time of this writing, "Plumbing Goop" is the cheapest on Amazon.IN GENERALGoop will bond virtually any material, including leather, plastics, glass, and metal.  The bond is clear, very strong, waterproof, and hard but flexible.EXAMPLESExamples are endless.  In addition to the examples below, I've used it to repair ceramic plant pots and shoes.  I also use it to seal rust spots on my dishwasher rack.  The Goop it also makes a "cushioned" surface that will prevent scratches to dishes.  I use Goop to close small holes in window screens.  I've used Goop to seal holes in air-mattresses.ELECTRICALGoop is far superior to electrical tape for splicing wires, re-insulating cat-chewed wires, waterproofing and vibration-proofing electrical connections.  There is a black variety of "Shoe Goop" if you want your repair to be less noticeable.PLUMBINGGoop is great for sealing small leaks (including garden hose connections, etc.).  However, you have to turn off the water, and the connections must be absolutely dry.  Moreover, it takes several days for Goop to dry to reasonable strength.  If you turn on the pressure before then you will make a water balloon.  It's better to wait a week.  Moreover, it may take several applications to get a thick enough layer of Goop to hold against normal household pressure--so a sink, toilet, etc. may be out-of-commission for at least three days waiting for the Goop to dry.SHORTCOMINGS1) An opened tube thickens quickly.  Store open tubes in a small glass jar with a tight metal lid.  Old thick Goop does not work well for some uses (such as repairing shoes), but is perfect when you need a thick application--such as insulating an exposed electrical connection or to hold pressure in a leaking water line.  It is best to start with a thin layer from a new tube to maximally bond to the surface2) Until it dries, Goop flows, alot.  Therefore a thickly-applied layer may dry to a very thin layer (because most of the glue has flowed somewhere else).  So, it may be essential to apply several thin layers (at intervals of 4 hours or longer) rather than one thick layer.  Alternatively, you can apply a thicker layer of old thick Goop over an initial layer of new Goop.  If possible, arrange the pieces you are gluing to minimize flowing, i.e., usually horizontal.  For several hours, depending on the temperature etc., the glue is "repositionable" after thickening a little, that is, you can push it back into place.  Unfortunately, if you use too many layers or "reposition" the glue too much, the result is not as attractive.3) Except when still tacky (when it can be removed with naptha or acetone), Goop is essentially non-cleanup-able.  So, for example, while it might be terrific for fixing a leaking windshield, if you mess up and your application is ugly, there is essentially nothing you can do about it.  Although Goop is terrific for repairing a broken ceramic statuette--if a little extra oozes out, there is no way to clean it up the excess.  You could simply peel/rub-off excess silicon glue.  You could simply wipe off "white glue" and clean up with a moist paper towel.4) The fumes are strong and toxic.  Allow glued items to dry in a well-ventilated area (ideally out-of-door) for several days.  When doing alot of gluing, I work in my carport with a large utility fan blowing the fumes away---and still usually get a nasty headache.  It is best to use gloves when working with Goop.TO GOOP OR NOT TO GOOPWhile Goop is truly miraculous--there are situations when other types of glue are better choices.White Glue:  For most light-duty indoor household applications which do not have to be waterproof, ordinary household white glue is much safer, cleanup is much easier, and in most cases repairs are redo-able if you make a mistake.  For example:Elmer's All Multipurpose White Glue, 7 5/8 oz. (E379)Wood Glue:  Carpenters's wood glue is essentially water-proof (when dry) white household glue.  It is much better than Goop for most wood repairs.  It penetrates and strengthens the wood.  It is much safer, and cleanup is much easier.

Like Goop, silicon glue takes days to reach reasonable strength, weeks to reach maximum strength.  For example:GE Silicone II Household Glue, 2.8 ozEpoxy:  When you need a strong rigid workable (e.g. sandable surface) adhesive, particularly for use on metal or hard plastic, epoxy is a muchbetter choice.  For joining metal "J&B; Weld" epoxy is best.  Most epoxies dry with little running or shrinkage, and so are good for filling gaps.  Fiberglass epoxy is best for joining/filling hard plastic.  Epoxies are safer than Goop, and cure much quicker.  For example:J-B Weld 8265-S Cold WeldCLEARBOND H-3S Clear Strong Epoxy Adhesive Syringe - .85ozAPPLICATOR TIPIf you use the applicator tip, and do not use the entire tube at one time, much unused glue remains in the tip, which is wasted and clogs up the tip.  If you plan to use the glue again within about a week, then jam an old unused (uncut) applicator tip over the one on the tube, and store in a small glass jar with a tight lid.  If you aren't likely to do more gluing within two weeks, remove the tip and put the cap back on (and store the tube in a small jar with a tight lid)  If it is necessary to clean out an applicator tip, then take it off the tube, let the glue dry for several days, then pull it out with tweezers.CONCLUSIONGoop is one of those "miracle" products with a thousands uses, which needs to be a permanent part of any household.  Other such items include silicon greasePermatex 22058 Dielectric Tune-up Grease - 3 oz.painter's tapeScotchBlue Painter's Tape 2090-1E2, 1 Inch by 60 Yards, 1 Roll, and WD-40.  WD-40 Spray Lubricant - 16-oz. I've been a regular user of Permatex silicone spray for over ten years.  I use the spray mostly as preservative for rubber, plastics, and other synthetic materials, and as a lubricant for things like lock mechanisms, zippers, screws, and joints.  I apply it to the rubber hoses and sealing strips in my car, my bicycle tires, running shoes, nylon cases and luggage, and even camera gear.  Silicone is also a good electrical conductor.  After cleaning electrical contacts, I apply a little spray, which seems to improve performance and deters corrosion.Unlike CRC's silicone spray which can react with and deface and damage certain plastics, Permatex's silicone spray has never damaged anything that I have used it on.  The spray comes with a tiny plastic tube that you can insert into the spray nozzle, so that the spray can be concentrated and applied in a confined area, like the key slot in a lock.  The only real gripe I have is that the product has a tendency to foams up when sprayed, and this is exacerbated when the tube is attached.  The resulting "spray" is usually really messy, and hard to apply evenly.  Other than this, I have no major complaints about the product, which has apparently been in production for over 90 years.Silicone spray is flammable, but not exceedingly so.  Still care should be exercised in its use, and adequate ventilation should be provided.  The Permatex spray can holds 10.25 ounces, which is more than theCRC 05074 CRC product.  The Permatex spray costs about $4.50 at my local store, so you might want to check around for the best price. 
This fluid evacuator leaks around the top cover, both under vacuum and pressure. After taking the cover off it is apparent that the o-ring seal is too small to make up the gaps in the wavy top surface of the cylinder. I will keep it and make it work, most likely with silicone, but that sort of defeats the fluid dispensing function, as I will not be able to thoroughly clean the container without sealing it up with new silicone each time.The fact that it can be used for pressure or vacuum is good. The pump and associated plumbing works great, just a poor design for the cover seal. I use this Meguiar's Microfiber wash mitt strictly for the painted exterior parts of my vehicle and not the wheels to extend the life of it.  The wash mitt is a supersoft microfiber that will not scratch your paint.  It holds soap/water well so you dont have to keep refilling from the bucket.  The only minor complaint is the inner liner always comes out if you dont put your hand inside of it which i rarely do.  Eventually I'm going to get annoyed enough and cut the inner liner.  I think it would of been easier to just not have the inner liner.  Also to extend the life of the wash mitt make sure you clean out the dirt and soap with water and ring it out then let it air dry flat. ...oil to water, this agent will solve any need you have to patch, bond, fix, fill, attach, mend, glue, fasten, stick, plus it is resilient to cold, heat, vibration and surfaces can be slick or porous.I used Ultra Black until this came out and.yes it does make great gaskets but that is only the biginning. I fixed tears in my kayak, patched up my.boots, bonded a toaster oven under counter...anyways, you should get the idea by now. 
Armor-All is a miracle worker for tired, dried, old upholstery. It cleans, seals, protects, covers scratches, and makes leather and vinyl look new again. I've been using it since the early 1980s, and highly recommend it.  I use it on the seats, dash, inner doors, and even on the tire sidewalls.  I've also used it on leather and vinyl purses, an office chair, and leather book covers.Just spray, let it soak in, then wipe it off well.  If you buff it, it doesn't leave an oily residue or any odor.  Don't use it on any place that would be a slipping hazard, like floors, because it does leave a slippery finish.Try Armor-All and you'll be amazed at how great your car seats can look! Great cover! I put it on in minutes after delivery and warming a little, and it is not moving; low 80's outside today but likely over 110F in the car. I do not have sweaty hands and it does not look like color came off. It is smooth leather and is dyed black, much like belts and shoes, which can rub off on contact (belts do after repeated hand-contact and probably stain the inside of belt loops without our knowing). For those with sweaty hands get a rubber-cover with grips (stinky) or vinyl (slippery) but neither are very durable in hot cars; you won't be as happy with the comfort unless it is leather. Non-leather will smell toxic or be slippery, but it will not bleed color. If your hands sweat they may slip on vinyl or smooth rubber. This product has a great grip and feel and leathery smell.There is an inner rubber-sleeve )non-smelly) that prevents the cover from moving. I set the product in the sun for about 5 minutes and it made it ply-able enough to work it on. I recommend starting with the center-most seam on top of a straight wheel(there are 3 seams at roughly 12,4,8 O'clock), carefully work the outer edge over the wheel and down both sides evenly (the first 3/4's is easy), use patience and care, then roll the edge into position. If it is off-center it cannot be slid sideways. Take it off carefully and begin again with it more centered and work each side evenly; a little here, a little there. Do not put this on cold or stretch without warming; it can damage/crack/tear cold leather.I placed this on a 15" 2008 Chevy Aveo5 steering wheel (do measure your wheel diameter before ordering). The only con to these types of covers is they cannot wrap the inside, so the fingers feel the outer edges of the cover; in this case it is smooth, rolled, and well stitched and I have gotten used to it. It is probably made in China at this price but it looks and feels like good quality. I recommend this and would choose to buy again and recommend to a friend. I also recommend a little leather conditioner on this, much like one would use on leather car interiors. It is smooth leather, not suade or roughened.In 'the old days' I bought wrapped 'stinky' vinyl, and used vinyl to thread through holes and wrap around the cover with tension (still available) and it filled the inner part of the wheel. It was difficult and time-consuming, and, the vinyl strings eventually breaks. I recommend this 'new and improved' version. Rubber and vinyl degrades in heat and UV. Did you know that wonderful 'new car smell' is highly carcinogenic, expecially when hot, and all the glue they use on carpeting and interior fabric, also. This has been well known and accepted for over 50 years but it sells cars. FYI. This couldn't be simpler...put it at the bottom of your wash bucket, and as you rinse the dirt off your sponge/mitt/brush/whatever, it sinks to the bottom, under the Grit Guard where it can't get back on your car. I might be paranoid, but sometimes I do find quite a bit of dirt and grit near the bottom of my wash water...now I don't worry as much about these particles somehow acting like sandpaper against my car's finish.Only drawback is that it doesn't fit smaller buckets.Definitely recommended to anyone fanatical about keeping the car finish pristine. 
I had an L-shaped crack in the corner of my windshield. I tried a few local glass repair shops and none of them were willing to attempt a repair (but would have happily replaced the whole windshield for $300).So I figured that I had nothing to lose with this repair kit. The crack was slowly spreading so I wanted to fix it soon.Since it was a long crack repair, I didn't need to use the suction cup adapter to force the repair resin into the crack. I just started at one end of the crack with the bottle, slowly dripping the repair resin into the crack.For the most part, the fluid seeped right into the crack, I ended up with a few air bubbles in the crack, but overall it seemed to flow into most of the cracked area.After letting the fluid seep into the crack, I covered it with the curing sheets and moved the car into the sunlight for 15 minutes.I peeled off the sheets and scraped off the excess hardened resin with a razor blade (which wasn't as hard as I thought it'd be).The crack is still visible (but less visible than before the repair), so I wouldn't try to repair a crack that was in my line of sight. So far (after 2 weeks) it seems to be holding up well -- the crack has stopped growing.I'm quite satisfied with the repair - it saved me $300 for a new windshield. Used this RTV to create a gasket on an F150 differential cover. Used about 1/3 to 1/2 tube on the diff cover to ensure adequate coverage.  Applied around the bolt holes.  Begins to get tacky in about 5 minutes. Installed diff cover and finger tightened bolts, let set for approx. 1 hour.  Then tightened bolts to OEM specs.  Filled with gear oil and no leaks. Fits perfectly on a 1992 2.2 Camry. The plastic washer that came with it was tossed in the trashed and used OEM gasket instead. 
I lube my slideout and other seals and gaskets on my motorhome about twice a year.  This works well on the gaskets of the storage compartments.  Be aware that it is really messy to spray on.  You have to open your slides to access the seals, and this comes out of the can similar to engine degreaser - a foam that is messy.  It gets on the painted surfaces and needs to be wiped off promptly. With a straw from another lube can, I can spray it on the top gasket which is almost impossible to reach.  For the side gaskets on the slideout, I find that it is less messy to put on a plastic glove, spray it in my hand, and rub it on.  Works okay that way.  If you are on the road, and your slideout seal is sticking or binding, try baby power. This is an effective product, but Thetford needs to change the nozzle to control the mess. My '99 Bounder diesel had Valterra valves on it, but the handle for my grey water tank had one half snap off in the cold one year.Plus, after 15 years, said grey water valve's seal had started to drip a tiny bit.  My wife can smell a flea's fart from a mile, so I knew about it in short order.Now, it was a definite challenge to get the seals to remain in place while wedging the valve into place, though I put a thin coating of silicone grease on mine to both prevent leaks and prolong lifespan, but I found, if I loosened the hose clamp holding the pipe to the tank, I could twist the pipe and push it in...GENTLY.  This gave me enough room to get both the grey and black tank valves in place, seals properly seated. What I like about this funnel;  Long useful tube for difficult places.  AT the top of the tubing is a twist on/off valve.  Measuring cup integrated into the top container making it easy to &#34;get it right.&#34;  Last but not least, you get a lid for the top and a cap for the bottom so no worries about getting dirt while it sit's in the garage waiting to be used again.  Highly recommended! 
I required an ammonia-free window cleaner for my tinted windows. This does the job quite nicely. It isn't how well it does, rather how safely it does it. Dries pretty quickly so you can get your work done fast. Easy to sand and mold to the contours of your work. If you need to fill in light scratches or pinholes in filler then this will work great. Dries quickly (if not too thick) and sands easily once dry. If you try to sand it before it is dry, it is going to clog up your sandpaper but once dry it sands well. Easy to use and minimal shrinkage. 
These seem to fit well enough, but don't line up perfectly with the existing trim. They serve their purpose. I think they are a little expensive for such small pieces of plastic and would be happier with aluminum or steel. I'm also not a huge fan of double-sided tape as the sole attachment method. Despite those gripes, they do add a finishing touch and will protect against scrapes on the door sill. Like others, I'm not sure why these aren't installed from the factory other than a money grab. I do notice a little play once they are attached. It remains to be seen how long the tape will hold them with temp changes and shoe snags. Should they peel off, I'll attack them with Gorilla Glue and clamps for a more permanent solution. used it on a surface on my BMW 328ic near the trunk area. I had 2 little spots approx. 1x2&#34; on the left and right that had rust forming UNDER the rubber gasket... I brushed of the rust with a dremel type tool and metal wheel brush to clear all rust and paint and used this on top. let dry for a day before repainting and applying clear coat. It does not seem to penetrate the little rust remaining as other products. I used &#34;Rost-Egal&#34; from Germany many many years I lived there and that has been the best product so far. You use it once and just know it works. With this very liquid product I am not so sure... It did not even seem to &#34;stick&#34; very well to vertical surfaces. For the next job I will look for a &#34;thicker&#34; product that will cling more to the treated area. I use them and I like them... though since they seem to be made from painted carbon steel do not let them stand in the garage floor over winter. They will most likely begin to rust. I sprayed a bit of rubberized undercoating on them to at least prevent rust for a while 
I've been a Sta-bil user for over seven years now and their products have never let me down.  I switched from the regular red formula to the green marine marine formula due to the green's supposed better performance with ethanol-blended fuels.  Since switching, I've noticed a smoother idle and faster starting of my equipment.  The 32oz container is very economical and the dispenser bottle is easy and clean to use.  The 32oz green bottle treats up to 160 gallons while the 32oz red bottle treats only 80 gallons, so the green stuff is an even better bargain.Sta-bil is a must-use product for anyone that owns any type of power equipment such as a lawn mower, trimmer, edger, snow blower, or generator, or something that sees seasonal use such as a motorcycle or classic car. Goes with mower yearly tuneup.The only problem I had was the bottle had a small hole in it. The box and other items I had ordered were soaked in oil. The bottle had leaked 2 oz. For almost $9 this is too much. I recycle my old 1 gallon milk jugs and take them to my auto store for recycling. This is much easier on the wallet since you already bought the milk. 
I have used this solvent a number of times to remove adhesive and badging from my cars.  For that it works wonderfully.  When used modestly it does not effect automotive surfaces or glass.  Since this stuff is so potent, I would recommend using the the spray straw in the nozzle so that you can more carefully target where you spray this stuff.  You want to be very careful where you put it.  It also evaporates rapidly so you need to work quickly when you use it.Just to reinforce a few precautions:- Do not get this on plastic (it will discolor it) or any soft/organic materials.- Do not use around high eat, as it is extremely flammable- Limit all bodily exposureOverall this is a wonderful product, just be very careful how you use it. Will it work? YesMaybe a squeeze bottle would be better as bottle is not always being stored upright.Area needs to be free of grease. This is the best stuff on earth when you need to do a repair and cannot do a proper weld. It will also stick to most anything including plastics. It is strong and can be sanded, drilled, tapped, and machined once it is set up. A must for any shop or do-it-yourselfer. 
There are two horns, not one. One is 400Hz and the other one is 500Hz.PIAA | Automotive Sports Horn (400/500Hz) #85110The are exact fits on the mounts as the OEM horns and use the same bolts. A 1/4 inch drive ratchet and a 12mm socket is needed to remove and install the bolt. They came with grounding leads with ring spade lugs that mounted readily under the existing M6 bolts on the radiator supports. All you need is a 10mm socket.The two wiring harness leads are too short to connect the horns. Two wire tie mounts hold the harness to the aluminum bumper reinforcement. You can cut off the ties and use the OEM harness to connect the horns, but I chose not to.  I prefer NOT to cut off the OEM connector blocks.I made two pigtail extensions out of 18 gauge black primary wire, 5 inches long. One end needs a 1/4 inch wide exposed male quick disconnect. The other end needs an insulated female 1/4 inch quick disconnect terminal. Since I used 18 gauge wire, I used the red coded ones.The exposed male connector slides into the OEM horn connector perfectly. The female one clips easily onto the positive terminal of each horn.The horns how have a weather shield on the apertures.Best thing to my surprise is that they appear to be very high quality and Made in Japan.Also nice is that they need no modification to the horn relay or circuit. Works great, nice to have a second cable, but the OBD end of the cable is angled.  In my case, this cable won't work on my Subaru Outback.  I would prefer the option of a straight OBD connector.  Note that the angle connector works on my other four cars (Mazda, Honda, Dodge). Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles.

Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs. Inexpensive, yet works as good as the ones sold by Honda dealerships. Made true to specs and fits right into the slot on my Accord 2006.Will buy again. 
Fit my '98 Nissan Frontier's oil pan perfectly. Looks to be of nice quality.  Torque to 25ft/lbs (on the Frontier anyway) Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. 32mm is the correct size for my Jetta TDI oil cap, and this fits perfectly.It's also fairly low profile, another plus. 
Didn't fit my trailer's tongue, properly.  I have posted pictures to show the poor fit.  Not sure about duplicate keys or how easy this would be to break off...all I know is that it doesn't fit properly.  Kind of a bummer. I was apprehensive about ordering this because of mixed reviews, and people saying it wouldn't quite cover their tire.  I did not have that problem at all.  Easy to put on, covered the tire, looks great, price was awesome.It has an expandable elasticized area to help fit over the tire, that goes back in to place.Very pleased. I was asked to rewrite my review for some strange reason. I can only assume it was because the person approving my review didn't understand the product or the review.&#34;These work great for the backseat riders. It assists them in climbing up into my 2012 Wrangler. Arrived on time and adequately packaged.&#34;This review is for Rear Seat Grab Handles... their purpose is to give the backseat passengers something to &#34;grab&#34; onto. They are made for Jeep Wranglers. They fit the headrests of a 2012 Jeep Wrangler based on my personal experience with MY 2012 Jeep Wrangler. They arrived on time and weren't all jacked-up, so I can only assume that the packaging was adequate. 
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Nobody else has mentioned it.  This is the K&N size for anyone who uses the Ford FL1A.  It also works in place of the Derale 13092. This product does not fit your 2012 Toyota Tacoma! That's according to Amazon.YES, IT DOES FIT MY 2012 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab.I don't know what that white powder is on the rubber seal, but I cleaned it before installing the cap.  No error codes and no gas stolen so far. 
At less then $10 this is a steal!  The unit is well made and really does a nice job.  It's far bettter then the round adapter that plugs straight in and that on the back side you plug in the 30 amp cord.  The 90 degree 15 amp plug emliminates the problem of the cord pulling out or partially disconnecting from the outlet. This is heay gauge,and heavy duty!I use this to connect up to my 1150 cca diehard marine battery.With the battery tender,Cigarette socket installed,I then plug in my ARB Cooler,load up and head out.With the pre installed 75a fuse it won't fail,never does! I installed this brake controller in a 1955 GMC pickup truck that I use for towing. Just follow the diagram for wiring and it just works like a breeze. I like the way you can adjust easily the voltage with the dial on the left and the mounts provided allows you to install it a convenient location under the dash (it works in any position).If you want to install this in a more modern truck without tapping directly into the wires, you will need additional adapters at extra cost. 
I bought these horns to replace the weak sounding horn that Toyota puts in the Corolla, Matrix, Prius, Yaris, ect.. These horns are very load to say the least. The Hella box included one low tone horn and one high tone horn. It also included instructions and a single Bosch style relay.There is NO wiring of any kind included with this purchase (this is why I gave it a 4 star). I made my own wiring harness which included a 30 amp fusible link, and the included relay and a relay socket. The following link is to the picture of my install on my 2006 Toyota Matrix XR:[...]Make sure you use the included relay in your install. I know some people have just used the existing single horn wire (not using relay), but these new horns have a pretty heavy amp draw! The last thing you want to do is mess up your factory wiring because of some horns. Do it the right way, and follow the instructions! Your horns will also sound better.You can not beat the price and sound quality of these horns! They will get your attention, I can promise you that.  I do recommend these horns! This unit looks and works like the original.It fit easily into the filter guide and I really don't see a need to spend any more money on  a OEM unit.And yes this is an easy do it yourself installation. These replaced the stock beep horns on my 03 Maxima. They bolt straight in, and I needed to tweak the position of the horn a bit due to short leads from the car. I did not need to do any rewiring. Package comes with the relay, but did not need it. Luckily the awful red covers and silver grilles pop off easily. You do need a high and low tone horn to get the proper sound. These are good horns for $17, but still not as penetrative as my BMW's. Overall, happy. 
I recently bought a 2011 Hyundai Tucson loaded to the gills and was astonished at how impossibly wimpy the single note factory horn was.  Leather seats, nav, panoramic sunroof, bluetooth, backup camera, kick-*ss sound system with subwoofer and iPod integration, etc., all kinds of toys.  Yet the factory horn sounds almost as robust as the horn in the 1966 VW bus my family had when I was a kid.  "Meep meep."  Note I said the Hyundai horn was ALMOST as robust as the '66 VW.  I think the VW horn had a little more oomph.  What was Hyundai thinking??I found a Hyundai tech to swap the original Hyundai/Kia P.O.S. horn with this item and the results are awesome.  My first ever new-car mod and it worked out great. The K&N KN-171C Harley Davidson/Buell High Performance Oil Filter not only works for me it works for the birds (There is a Red Cardinal that likes to see her image in the reflection of the filter). This product made my 2012 Dodge RAM 1500 quad-cab run quieter. This product seems to flow through the engine with ease. Thank you 
I have previously used in: 1980 Honda CX500C to fix a rough idle, 2000 Suzuki SV650 to stabilize fuel, and a 2005 Chevy Cobalt to fix a problem with stalling at idle. I mounted this as an auxiliary transmission cooler in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 with the 4.0.  No issues.  Obviously, this was a custom installation.  But with a little research on the jeep forums, no problem. Replaced the "nasty nissan matic fluid" with this in the transmission and also used it in the power steering and transfer case in my 2005 nissan titan. 
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. Exactly what was offered, fit nicely, no major prep work, won't fade or crack, adjusts perfectly, easy removal and fits under seat in truck Great Fit 
I was very pleased to find these on Amazon - and with Prime shipping! The filters cost a fraction of what I would have paid had a gone to the dealership to purchase them...let alone get them installed there. That being said, the design of the filter location is ABSURD! It took me about an hour to remove the old ones and install these. There was some time in the middle for watching a video on Youtube for how to replace these. The filters do come with instructions, which are pretty helpful.However, a step-by-step video is online that is extremely useful. I did not remove the glove box like they did - and I was still able to have success. It was a frustrating process trying to squeeze my hands where they needed to go to remove the screws and other components. Still, in the end it is worth the frustration considering I saved about 100 dollars by doing it myself! I cannot say enough good things about the Bosch Icon wiper blade. My brother installed a set on his Ford Super-Duty about 6 months ago and we were blown away by what a difference a few extra dollars can make. I just had to get this set for my Civic. They are quite simply the best wipers I have ever used. Windshield is usually cleared completely in one pass with no streaking. Can't wait for the rainy reason to try my new set out. They work just great for what I want.  I have two sets of them that I use on my travel trailer.  Will buy two more sets when the others that I use wear out. 
Cant say how it works until/if i ever need to remove the O2 sensor I used it to install.If i ever run out I will buy more. I am satisfied with this product, and what it does, because we all know how rust is and if we don't, let me say it can be a pain in the but you know what i'm trying to say, so to expect miracles would be beyond expectations.will use again. Sorry to say, I  have never used the sewer hose support as of yet.  So  I can not really say how good it is. I guess it is a great hose support if you have to use it.  Sorry, can not say how it works 
So I bought this to replace my 20 year old, kicked around, same version of this gauge.  I had suspected my old one was not reading properly.  So I got this new one.  I am happy to report that the 20 year old one reads exactly the same as this new one.  So now I have a spare to keep in my other car.  The only thing I don't like about this model vs the old one is my old one had a little release valve. So it holds the needle where the pressure reading was till you press the release.  Very handy.  And it was my fault for not noticing it wasn't there on this new version.  Overall, I couldn't be happier with this product.  If you have a car, and have tires, and want them to last, having the correct tire pressure matters. Easy to install in 2003 grand cherokee.  I can now work under the hood and fix all the things the previous owner did not fix.  I am batman They work just great for what I want.  I have two sets of them that I use on my travel trailer.  Will buy two more sets when the others that I use wear out. 
They don't. I waited too long to try them so I can't return. The model optimizer clearly said this is what I should order. They are not sized properly. I've bought Bosch before too. I needed to replace one of the nozzles on my Honda Element, and based on my experience with other cars figured it would cost about $5-8. Wrong. $28 for a nozzle?? No way.I ordered this kit based on the customer reviews, and I couldn't be more pleased. It took me only a minute to replace the broken one- you don't even need any tools to do this- and I still have a spare for the next time I do something stupid while scraping ice off my car ;-) It fit perfectly on my 2005 Mercury Grand Marquis. I don't know why I didn't get one earlier. The gas tank could have been siphoned anytime by anyone. The previous owner just didn't care as the car had been in a garage every day. The new cap is easily unscrewed by one turn of the key. I don't need the plastic strap around the cap as I just set it aside when filling up. 
I purchased this belt for my 2003 Chevy Tahoe. I had no idea Chevy would put 2 serpentines on a newer generation vehicle. This smaller belt fits the A/C system only. It works like a champ and fits perfectly. I would recommend the Gatorback belts to EVERYONE! As an installation side note, you have to remove the air intake and larger serpentine to get to this "bottom of the motor" mounted unit.... way to engineer that one GM! Works great, nice to have a second cable, but the OBD end of the cable is angled.  In my case, this cable won't work on my Subaru Outback.  I would prefer the option of a straight OBD connector.  Note that the angle connector works on my other four cars (Mazda, Honda, Dodge). I bought this belt for my 2003 Chevy Tahoe with the 5.3L engine and 145A Alternator. Make sure you know which alternator you have BEFORE purchasing this belt. The 105A alternators use a slightly shorter belt. It fits perfectly, doesn't make any noise and works great! You will also need the smallerGoodyear 4040377 Gatorback Poly V-Beltfor the A/C system on these vehicles.My 145 Amp Alternator has a 145A stamped on the side, visible from the drivers side. You could also look for the old belt part number on the existing belt and order accordingly. 
I've seen the reviews questioning the capacity of this cord, so I'm wondering if maybe there are changes in the cord.  The one I received is marked on the back of the package:"18 gauge wire""15 Amp Capacity"Now, I'm not an electrician, nor do I pretend to be one.  I don't know that 18G wire is sufficient to carry 15A.  I'll be using this for a small GPS that I mounted up high and I don't want the cord in the windshield. GLAD  I  WENT  WITH  THE  CHROME AND  NOT  THE BLACK ONE, I  HOOKED  THIS ONE UP TO  MY GV1400 MOTORCYCLE IF  YOU  HAVE JUST  A  LITTLE  KNOW  HOW YOU CAN  DO  IT YOUR SELF , ALL  YOU WILL NEED TO GO WITH THIS IS A RELAY THAT DOES NOT COME WITH IT. YOU  CAN  GET IT ON HERE OR ANY PART STORE, I  HAVE MADE MANY PEOPLE JUMP  DUE  TO THE SOUND OF  THE  HORNS  LOUDNESS. I purchased this for my 2005 Avalanche to use while I am towing my 28 foot camper.  Prior to having these all I could see behind me was my camper, now I can see any car that is behind me, it's a must have for anyone pulling a trailer that is difficult to see behind and is much better and more stock looking than the other mirror options out there. 
I bought a pair of these for my 2002 Grand Cherokee. It took a grand total of 5 minutes to install both of them, and half of that was spent looking for a screwdriver.If you are at all nervous about trying this, here is a overly detailed set of instructions.1. Open hood. Prop it open with something wooden so it doesn't fall on you.2. Identify the strut on the right side of the hood.3. Identify the small metal clip at both ends of the strut. If in doubt, look at the new ones. You are looking for a metal band, about 1/2 inch in width, with two small slots. On the vehicle, slide a small screwdriver blade into the clip's slots, and twist the screwdriver to pry the clip upward. You can remove it, or just loosen it enough that there is a good sized gap between the clip and the strut.4. Now pull the strut away from the hood/body. You may need to slide a screwdriver behind the strut arm to get a little bit of leverage. It is easier to start with the end attached to the hood.5. Remove both ends of the strut from the vehicle.6. Attach the new strut. Make sure the strut is aligned the same way as the old one-with the cylinder at the top of the strut. (Refer to the opposite strut). Just place the socket in the strut over the ball joint on the vehicle, and give it a little tap or squeeze with your hand. It should snap right on.7. Repeat on the other strut.Note- if it seems like the strut is too big, the hood is probably not open all the way. There is NO WAY you are strong enough to compress the strut by hand.I'd strongly recommend replacing them in pairs, otherwise you will get a twisting motion on your hood. Plus if one failed, the other one is close behind.That's it, you're done. The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around! Front side (towards the engine) oxygen sensor fit "exactly." That means there is not a bit of "extra" wire from the sensor to the connector. They do make one with a longer cord, but not sure why, because you can't get your hand/arm in there any better with a longer cord anyway!I did the front sensors on both sides of the car, because someone recommend it to keep things running smoothly on both sides. Glad I did, it seems to be working.Got a wrench? I ordered a fancy pants "socket" from Amazon along with the sensors to get into the "tight" spot. It turned out that the fancy sockets do NOT fit on the front sensors, at least not on this car, and then I ran around town trying to find one of those fancy pants "special" wrenches with the "split" socket on the end, but nobody had them.In desperation, and hoping for the best, I purchased a standard 7/8" combination wrench (where the heck is mine anyway?) to get the sensor off. Oops, I put the wrench on the old sensor and it wasn't even tight (probably why it gave me the DTC)! Installation was easy, aside from the arm and hand contortions getting the plugs loose (try a long shaft screwdriver from below to pop the clip while you're holding the other end from above).Note, on my car, "bank 1" is the cylinder set on the passenger side of the car! 
Could a wheel chock chock is a wheel chock could chock wheels?In this case: 2.Good build quality, worked well on my AG tires on the rear of the tractor. I used this controller to replace the horrible factory dodge controller in my 2010 ram 2500. This controller is worlds ahead of the factory controller in terms of features and available settings. If you are hauling a large trailer it is a must have. The boost function is a great feature that applies the trailer brakes ahead of the truck brakes. You can set boost to 3 levels to meet your desired brake feel. My fiver weighs around 2500lbs more than my truck and between this controller and the exhaust brake stopping is effortless. Bought this with Rancho bracket kitRancho RS5567 Steering Stabilizer Bracket Kitfor my 2002 f150 7700 on 35s. steering is much smoother and the steering wheel doesnt move when hitting bumps. i love it!

I think the VW horn had a little more oomph.  What was Hyundai thinking??I found a Hyundai tech to swap the original Hyundai/Kia P.O.S. horn with this item and the results are awesome.  My first ever new-car mod and it worked out great. Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!! Great replacement and works well.  I will buy another to have a spare for my 36 year old Ford RV 
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. 
After a power outage, I connected my refrigerator to this power supply. Sadly, its inverter was unable to support my refrigerator. The Duracell DPP-600HD doesn't have enough momentary  output to handle the initial start-up current spike of a refrigerator's compressor motor. The specifications say it can momentarily provide up to 960 watts. This equates to 8 amps at 120v.  Yet, public benchmark figures for a home refrigerator's start-up current indicate 13 amps for up to 1/2 second. Other appliances that use electric motors such as sump pumps are likely to exhibit the same characteristics. My suggestion is that customers immediately test this product with any device they intend to power during an outage.Some important specifications are missing in the Amazon listing.  One of the key statics is the capacity of the internal battery, which is 28 amp-hours at 12 v.  This equates to 336 watt hours.  Yet, AC output is much lower than this presumably due to inverter losses.  These losses increase with power output.  The following table illustrates this.  The last column is my calculation.load.................watts....hours....watt-hoursCordless telephone.....5........35.0 ...175Portable stereo.........10........22.0 ...220Laptop computer.......20........7.0 ....140Fan.......................100.........1.7....17036" TV...................133........1.2 ....1603/8 drill.................300........0.4 ....115Warm-air fan heater.312........0.4 ....109Blender..................385........0.3 ....109HID Floodlights.......400........0.3.....107Observe that the total energy delivered (watt-hour) drops with power consumption.  Ultimately, the usable energy is significantly less than what is contained within the lead acid battery.For reference, a refrigerator will use about 200 watts of electricity when the compressor is running. Typical consumers will have their refrigerator running about 50% to 60% of the time, which equates to an average of 100-120 watts being consumed continuously.ConsDoesn't handle current spikes associated with certain electric motorsProsBoth AC and DC outputPortableSimple operation I ordered 2 different chargers to maintain my gate opener's deep cycle battery (a simple 4 output charger with extension cords for charging other deep cycle batteries from amazonBattery Tender 022-0148-DL-WH 12V 4-Bank Battery Management System) and this unit has a far superior charging design.The 4 bank battery tender does a simple fast rate charge then switches to a trickle charge at a constant voltage with 4 outputs.This unit pulses the battery under charge and features 3 operating modes with different current outputs for different sized batteries. The selections are motorcycle which also works well for SLA gel cells or AGM batteries, standard automotive starting battery, deep cycle batttery, and off.What makes the CTEK unit special is that it uses a pulse charge in all modes to attempt to desulphate batteries, while the battery tender does not.  This method of charging has proven successful in restoring lead acid batteries that won't take a charge any more.It comes with a waterproof 12V output cable and a set of clips or rings for permanent installation under the hood of your car.  In addition to the LEDs for indicating the type of battery being charged, a second set is provided for empty, 1/2 full, and maintenance pulse charge mode.There is also a noticable increase in quality between the battery tender and this unit - small details like a water sealed housing and gaskets on the connectors indicate quality in manufacture.For a single 12V lead chemistry battery this is a useful, well made tool. The 3rd generation powerprobe includes a number of changes for additional flexibility.  In short, it is a vehicle powered DVM with both a 20 foot cable and an additional 20 foot extension giving you a 40 foot working range around either the battery terminals or cigarette lighter outlet, both clips and a plug are included in the kit.With the series 3 units they use a hard gold plated banana jack to hold the removable probe or cables to extend your reach.  If you purchase the accessory kit, it includes piercing probes that self center on a conductor, pierce the insulation, and attach to the jack allowing you to tap a wire at any point to locate intermittant problems.While the DVM is backlit all the time, it also has 2 bright white LEDs facing forward to aid in finding and probing terminals in dark places.  The actual probe is hardgold plated with a sharp tip and removable at the banana jack.  Another identical probe is included with a screw-in female banana jack in the accessories kit to retrofit the powerprobe I and II units to accept external cables and probes.If you need to excite a circuit with a connection to battery ground or to battery positive, the switch allows a momentary connection to bridge the probe tip to either voltage which is useful in testing relay driven circuits, indicator lights, and other small current loads.  The prope voltage is always displayed during testing on the meter. The voltage/ground switch is circuit breaker protected in case you accidentally drive 12 volts into a chassis ground.  Additionally, since the switch takes abuse it is easily replaced if it fails with just a screwdriver.Combined with the testlead set, the powerprobe 3 greatly simplifies testing of vehicular wire and big rigs up to a single trailer.  The DVM has 5 selectable modes of operation designed for different problems.  Reading the manual is important to get the full value from this meter.Although the price is a little high, the design and construction quality are excellent.  Enough wire is provided to check running lights on trailers or to look for blown fuses.  All of the wiring is exceptionally flexible and heavily insulated with top quality connectors.  Both the tester and accessories come in hard plastic cases that can be stowed in a service box.Not mentioned in specifications is that although the probe runs from 12-24 VDC, the meter can be used to measure voltages up to 80VDC. 
These lights will be the main lighting in my Teardrop Camper Trailer when I get back to work on it next spring. They look like good quality lights and the switch works perfectly on them. I connected one of them to 12v and they are nice and bright. The diffusers are great and do a good job of diffusing the light with no lines or shadows. These lights are very light weight, but that is not a concern as I am building my Teardrop as light as possible.If you are after LED lighting, these are also a good choice because you can easily upgrade the bulb to an LED Retrofit from most any Automotive supply store, Amazon, or Ebay. They have the direct replacement LEDs for RVs for most any fixture.You won't go wrong with these lights. to those who wish to know the truth regarding PIAA light bulbs.the PIAA light bulbs are no better than stock light bulbs.i purchased my 2004 toyota corolla brand new. the stock lights burned out in the year 2011.do the math, seven years without a stock light burn out.stock lights are just as good or better than the overpriced PIAA light bulbs.PIAA 10926 9006 (HB4) Intense White - 9006 51W=115W Xtra Intense White Bulb, Twin Pack They are nice bulbs, but don't last near as long as factory bulbs, and the headlights in a 2004 Dodge Ram are so poor, that not even these bright bulbs help.  I had to mount off road lights to use with my high beams, to take care of the problem.  I'm sure these bulbs are fine for other vehicles, but there's no hope for factory 2004 Ram headlights. 
Most products I've tried have left the nasty white streaks on my windshield when I turn on my wipers.  Not this stuff.  I actually added it to RainX Bug Wash the first time.  Then I added it to plain water when I ran the bug wash out.  Both times it left my windshield perfectly waterproof.  Best time to use it is when it's dry.  If you use it when it's raining it'll bounce off the water instead of going into the windshield.  I just spray a splash or two every time I start my car that way it's always ready in case it rains.  And when the thunderstorms come and people are pulling off the side of the road because their wipers can't keep up, you won't barely even need wipers since the rain beads up and runs off.  Perfect product! I bought this to maintain my motorcycle battery through the winter. Have ever experienced the time, and I am sure your have, when the weather nerd was wrong? It was supposed to be nice for your ride to and from work, the cold front with near freezing rain came rolling in 12 hours early, you didn't quite have the battery fully charged before you left because it would charge enough while you rode, then you got stopped by every red light on the way to work for a 10 hour shift, your bike sits 6 hours in 30 degree weather, and you come out only to hear the starter relay just click? Then your fingers are frozen and numb, and you are trying to get the tools out so you can open the cover where the battery is so you can jump it off with a car, when the rubber strap (the one that has many names) that holds the tool bag in finally pops loose and slaps you in the knuckles? Then this is the one thing a biker (or anyone with a car, truck, snowmobile that they use only occasionally) needs to keep the battery in top condition to avoid part of the scenario. It is easy to hook up, keeps the battery topped off, saves your battery, saves your knuckles, allows the people in the parking lot NOT to hear your extensive vocabulary, and is easy to use.Disclaimer:I cannot make claims to it being able to control or predict the weather, but then again neither can those college educated nerds... though some of those weather ladies can get away with anything in my book :-)I hope this review helps. If you have ever been stuck for 5 hours along side of the road waiting for the snow plow, you will begin to think about ways of preventing being stranded in the future.These chains fit the bill.They do what they are intended to.  Get you out of an emergency situation.HOW EASY ARE THEY TO PUT ON?There is not expertise required.  They are just cumbersome to get around a tire when it is freezing outside.  less so than regular chains I am told.HOW DURABLE ARE THEY?They will get you unstuck, and get you home if you have 10 miles to drive.  I wouldn't expect much more.  I have read they will break.  Don't expect to be driving on them all winter for the price.HOW DOES THE CAR DRIVE WITH THEM ON?Like a paint mixer.  Just put them on, put sugar and cr&egrave;me in your coffee and drive around the block.  After one block, you will have a nicely frothed cappuccino!Seriously.  Rough.  You don't want to drive any length with these on!HOW WELL DO THEY WORK?Even on an icy road with no snow, but a very thin sheet of ice(this is what myself and about 200 cars where stuck in) along country roads making it hard to make it through even the most mild turn at 10 miles per hour, they perform excellently to get you home.SUMMARY:For the money, buy them, and don't expect much but to get you out of a harry situation where you are stuck along the road.Getting home, rather than sitting alongside the road for 5 hours is worth 30 bucks!Mark :) 
...oil to water, this agent will solve any need you have to patch, bond, fix, fill, attach, mend, glue, fasten, stick, plus it is resilient to cold, heat, vibration and surfaces can be slick or porous.I used Ultra Black until this came out and.yes it does make great gaskets but that is only the biginning. I fixed tears in my kayak, patched up my.boots, bonded a toaster oven under counter...anyways, you should get the idea by now. I used to use RTV to help hold my gaskets down. Only issue with that is the next time you change the gasket you have to scrape all the RTV off to make sure you have a clean mounting surface for the next new gasket. Worse is that is you get to aggressive with your razor or gasket scraper you can scrape or gouge small scratches in the metal mating surfaces requiring you to have to use some type of RTV to help the new gasket seal the scratches you just left in the metal or risk leaks making their way through the scrapes you left behind. Get this and put a thin coat on the pan and the gasket give it a few min to set up and you'll be good. The gasket will stay in place and you will not have to worry about the gasket shifting or worse having to drop the pan again because the bolt holes for all the holes are covered by a shifting gasket. This dogbone lock is very nice and well buildt. It is perfect for use on any car or truck if you are going to remove it after each use. But it is not for use on a motorhome reciver, were it is going to be left on for some time.The problem is ! The protective rubber cap that covers the key entry, fits loosely. The cap will not stay on to protect the key entry slot. Any little bump in the road, and off it comes !  Dirt and water gets into the lock mechanism, the key will not go in and you will not get it off with out a cutting torch. 
These are not your cheap run of the mill clips. They are very thick and durable; solder joints on clips are good too. This product is definitely well made. We use these for our camper.  They are light weight, easy to store, and worth the money.  I feel that they are pretty durable and don't anticipate them breaking. These are nice. They fit the wheels perfectly, are lightweight, but not so much that they can't stop the car from rolling, and they are a bright orange color so you won't forget they are on there.  They stack on each other neatly too, which is great for storage when you aren't using them. 
with plastic bumpers being the norm, thought I'd use this plastic polish.  It brings the shine to the plastic painted areas just like step 2 does to the metal. I've owned Jeep Wranglers for seven years now. I switched from a traditional cleaner-wax product because Jeep Wranglers have black plastic hard-tops (well, during the winter at least!), black plastic fender flares, black plastic mirror housings, and on the newer Wranglers, black plastic bumpers and door handles and assorted other trim. A traditional wax applied to any of those turns them white, but if you don't treat them with something, they fade to an ugly mottled gray over time. Thus the Turtle Wax Ice, which can be applied to everything -- hard top, fender flares, bumpers, and the Jeep itself. This allows me to make my whole Jeep shine without worrying about getting some white residue on things that aren't supposed to have white residue.Note that this cannot be used on glass, it just streaks. So to make your glass  and mirrors nice and shiny and keep them from fogging up easily in the winter, you'll still need a traditional wax, not a polymer-based product (note - do not apply to exterior front or back glass, just to interior glass and to the side windows!). The same is true for plastic windows on Jeep soft tops, a traditional wax will keep them from turning yellow and help keep them scratch-free, a polymer product like this will just make them streaky. And if you're looking at a deteriorated finish or one with baked in bugs and tar, use some other product first to recondition your finish, don't use this on a badly oxidized or bug-and-tar-spattered paint job. So this product (and other similar polymer products) is not a solution for all protective purposes, but it sure does work well where it does work. I had an older version of this with a rough surface that trapped dirt constantly.  Impossible to clean.  But this one is shiny black powder-coated metal, and its way better.  Fit the oven in my Ragen 2003 27T Toyhauler perfectly. 
This is not a booster pack for people who don't know how to use one. There's no safety features. No off switch. No silly blinking lights and pumps and sirens. It's meant to start a dead vehicle and that's exactly what it does. The long cables make it easier to use than some others as well. The voltage gauge is a great feature too, as it lets you know how much is left in it rather than just a couple lights. I probably should compare it to another to see how accurate it is, but I really like how easy it is to use and turns off and on by itself. What can I say? It does what it says and I like the weight of it...makes it feel solid. I also like the LED light they put in so you can take the pressure in the dark/dim light. 
These lights will be the main lighting in my Teardrop Camper Trailer when I get back to work on it next spring. They look like good quality lights and the switch works perfectly on them. I connected one of them to 12v and they are nice and bright. The diffusers are great and do a good job of diffusing the light with no lines or shadows. These lights are very light weight, but that is not a concern as I am building my Teardrop as light as possible.If you are after LED lighting, these are also a good choice because you can easily upgrade the bulb to an LED Retrofit from most any Automotive supply store, Amazon, or Ebay. They have the direct replacement LEDs for RVs for most any fixture.You won't go wrong with these lights. I installed these on my 2005 GMC Envoy XL with brush guard and they work and look great. They really light up the offroad trails and remote roads at night. I used to have the very large Hella offroad lights and these are just as bright.Installation is no more or less difficult than other lights. There's no magic here - you have to run 12V and ground to the lights, the relay, to the battery, etc. I own 3 Clore Booster packs. One of them is the one with the built in inflator. These units are well built. They perform as advertised. I have had no issues with the chargers at all. I would prefer if they put battery indicator lights on these units as well. The 660 now has the indicator light and the battery protection which doesn't allow an overcharge. The older units have to be charged as per specs or you could damage the units. 
The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around! There are two horns, not one. One is 400Hz and the other one is 500Hz.PIAA | Automotive Sports Horn (400/500Hz) #85110The are exact fits on the mounts as the OEM horns and use the same bolts. A 1/4 inch drive ratchet and a 12mm socket is needed to remove and install the bolt. They came with grounding leads with ring spade lugs that mounted readily under the existing M6 bolts on the radiator supports. All you need is a 10mm socket.The two wiring harness leads are too short to connect the horns. Two wire tie mounts hold the harness to the aluminum bumper reinforcement. You can cut off the ties and use the OEM harness to connect the horns, but I chose not to.  I prefer NOT to cut off the OEM connector blocks.I made two pigtail extensions out of 18 gauge black primary wire, 5 inches long. One end needs a 1/4 inch wide exposed male quick disconnect. The other end needs an insulated female 1/4 inch quick disconnect terminal. Since I used 18 gauge wire, I used the red coded ones.The exposed male connector slides into the OEM horn connector perfectly. The female one clips easily onto the positive terminal of each horn.The horns how have a weather shield on the apertures.Best thing to my surprise is that they appear to be very high quality and Made in Japan.Also nice is that they need no modification to the horn relay or circuit. Everything about these jack stands speaks to quality.  These jacks stands are very well made of heavy gauge aluminum with a hardened steel pin with a bearing lock for the height adjustment.  Some light assembly with a flat head screw driver is required before use.  There's a screw (provided) that threads into the bottom of the base to fasten the stand support (red) and base together.  Another reviewer stated that his stand 'wobbled'. While it's possible that reviewers stand was defective, if the screw is threaded into the hole and tightened down firmly into the base, the stand won't wobble. On my SUV vehicle, the jack points are very close together, so the base of a tripod-style jack stand is too wide for use.  The narrow profile of these stands is perfect and allows me to slip the jack stand behind the jack and under the rear jack point. Once in position, remove the pin, adjust the height and reinsert the pin. I also don't care for the ratchet style jack stands, which have been known to fail.  There are lots of low priced jack stands on the market, but when it comes to safety (yours), spend a few extra dollars are get a pair of these pin-thru aluminum jack stands by Torin.  They work extremely well and they look cool too. 
I would install this on your Jeep as soon as you purchase the vehicle.  They're very easy to install and protect you from scratches that could lead to rust.  The guards fit perfectly on my 2011 Jeep Rubicon 2 door. It locks and unlocks well with a &#34;positive&#34; engagement feel when it is secure. Fits great for both my front bumper receiver and rear receiver on my 2005 Dodge Ram.  No complaints, and I'd definitely buy it again. These worked for my 2005 jeep grand cherokee.  I like how these bulbs will replace any of the three rear lights. 
These are a must for any JK owner.  So cheap and great quality.  Installation is a snap and they look great.  I bought the red ones as well but I didn't like them.  Black looks much better and matches my interior. I don't know why Wranglers don't come with some kind of door sill protection, but these are inexpensive and easy enough to apply.Look great, appear to be durable, and have no odd edges to snag. First, as with all of the Dupli-Color Metalcast paints, if you want the metalcast effect, you'll have to use the Dupli-Color Metalcast Ground Coat (MC100) on the surface before you apply the color or it will not come out right. The can says that it also comes out the same if you're painting directly onto chrome like surface but I have not tried this so I don't know. Now for this green. I'm more of a blue and purple guy for dark colors so only by my personal preference do I say that this green comes out just a tad light in color for me. Overall though, if you use the ground coat this comes out great with a nice metal sheen. I recommend this product. 
I have been using a Battery Tender Junior for about 5 years on my motorcycle.  I always plug in the bike and it works great.I recently purchased the Battery Tender Plus to use on my Duramax truck (2 batteries).  It seems to work great so far.  I expect long life of the unit and the batteries just as I have in the past using this line of Battery Tenders.I give it 4 instead of 5 stars only because of the short length of cable they give you.  The Junior's cables are so long that I can run that thing clear across the room.  The Plus' cables are so short that I had to splice in more cable.  They apparently don't expect you to charge your batteries in-vehicle with the Plus.By the way, the Plus brings my 2 very large batteries in my truck upto full charge in less than 8 hours.  They are new batteries and the truck's charging system works just fine and the truck is even driven almost everyday.  However, there is alot of parasitic draw on the batteries with the remote start / alarm system on overnite.  Combined with the 100 plus degree heat of the desert, the Battery Tender Plus is warranted.Of course I would not expect it to recharge my truck batteries if they were dead.  It is not designed to.  Make sure you look at the specs and know what you need.  I just needed a battery tender - something that would keep my batteries at full charge or restore the bit of charge lost overnite from the parasitic draw of the car alarm / starter.  By spec, the Battery Tender Plus cannot recharge these large batteries from dead.  Again, know what you need.  The tech folks at Deltran can help you with that. This battery tender Jr. is great for anything you want to store or have ready for cold winter.The technology is state of the art.I have one Battery tender "senior'which has twice the power to charge my stuff fast,and three Jr's to keep a motorcycle,Gel battery Miata,and emergency generator in check.The jr's have half the "juice",but unless you want a faster charge(8hrs vs. 16 hrs on a dead battery,you can do just fine with the Jr's.A couple things to note.The Jr's come with aligator clips and ring clips,the Senior only comes with ring clips,so make sure you add the alligator clips with your order.Keep in mind every battery is in a different state of service,depending on age etc., so make sure you check the battery after about 6hrs the first time you use the tenders.If the battery is warm,you probably want to keep close watch on your charging,its probably the battery.Packaging and delivery are as good as can be(Amazon direct).Get one soon ,or two or three! The Battery Tender Junior 12V Charger comes complete with everything needed to charge your 12V battery.  I purchased this model to specifically charge my motorcycle battery and I am pleased to say that the unit works great.  It is a very compact charger and is supplied with several attachments to ensure that your battery is kept in an optimum condition.I made the permanent hard wire attachment to my battery using the color coded leads connected directly to the appropriate positive & negative terminals on the battery. The opposite female end has an end cap which can cover the inlet when not in use. When I know that I will not be hitting the road for an extended period of time, I simply plug the unit in to maintain my existing battery's power supply.Battery Tender makes larger charging units, but this battery charger is great for charging everything from batteries for ATV's and motorcycles to scooters and lawn mowers. Because of it's very discreet size it does not take up any needed space. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to protect their battery investment and do not want to compromise space and versatility. 
I use two of these when using a spray wax after each wash, one to apply, another to buff.  Very good quality as it does not scratch my black trucks.  However, they are not thick and for using on a pick up, you should use a set for each side and then one for the roof/hood (six cloths) if you are the type that is very particular on your vehicle shine.  If not picky, one set would work fine. Installed these with the KC windsheild mounts on my 90 YJ. The harness and instructions were really easy to follow .Installed in less than 2 hours with everything tied down and hidden. My wife and I were out in the jeep looking at Christmas lights and I was on a dark road and flipped them on. WOW! These 130W daylighters definetely light up the road. They were so bright my wife asked if they were legal.Several things, you have two grounds, make sure they are grounded to a good metal surface, I used sandpaper to remove the paint about the size of a dime for my grounding points both in the engine compartment.If you have a narrow mounting location, you may want to consider the slim lights, these are heavy and shaped like a motorcyle headlight.The only negative thing I can say is that the light covers with the smiley face went out in the 80's. I painted mine black and placed a vinyl KC sticker on them. Looks much better, but still ordered the KC rock light covers so you can turn them on at any time without removing them. (5 stars if they would have come with a rock guard cover, instead of the solid yellow smiley faces.) I use these inline on Aux Lighting, they work perfectly. Rather than having to cut wires, I can simply unplug these and dismount the light. Save so much time and they are weather resistant. I use some Diode Grease to protect the internals from moisture and have had no issues at all. 
Made in China poor quality item that does not befit the Robert Bosch brand at all.Not for winter for sure.The origin of the product should be stated at the product page.If I knew it were a MADE-IN-CHINA I would not have bought it. Considering this is made in China, it is a quality product, too bad all my locks are keyed to the some number These filters are made by a well-known manufacturer and have great quality, but the price is lower than buying the manufacturers equivalent name brand. Excellent quality. 
Almost too bright, but I love it.  Maybe the 100 watt model would be better than these 130's if your eyes are sensitive to bright lights.  Exactly what my 2004 Dodge Ram needed because the factory headlights stink.  My brights were no brighter than my low beam, and my old 1985 Nissan had brighter brights, but these KC 130 watt driving lights solved that problem perfectly.  For not being the full, long range lights KC offers, they sure shine pretty far, plus spread the light out to the sides and up into the trees, a good long range / flood combination.  I mounted them to my push/brush guard.  Took about 3 hours to install because I like to route, hide, and secure the wires very well.  I connected the white switch / relay hot wire to my high beam (brights)wire on the drivers side, so they go on and off with my high / low switch, plus I have the master switch mounted (without the switch frame) near the dash to keep the KC lights off completely if I want.  Just make sure you dim your lights (turn off the KC's) before you see anyone ahead of you or you'll blind them and can get a ticket if on a public road.  First night I tried them a big 8 point ran across the road in front of me, then stopped and pretty much "tip toed" off the road as if he was totally blind and afraid to move.  So beware of animals freezing in front of you with these things.  I turned them off and honked so he could run away.  And no, I don't hunt that way.The wiring diagram on the outside of the box did not show the white power / relay wire, as if it was pre-wired into the main power wire, but luckily there was the white power / relay wire available to tap into my high beam wire.  The wiring diagram on the directions in the box was correct.  Some vehicles newer than 1999 may not allow tapping into the high beam wire because of the vehicle's computer that senses voltage changes, but it worked on mine.  Only thing I had to supply was a sheet metal screw to secure the relay.  I cut off about 5 feet of extra wire that went to the switch.  The length of wire to the lights was just right. This unit is well made and was easy to install.I can now run 3 different pieces of equipment off my front dash.Just what I needed.Would recommend this to anyone looking to add 12V power hookups to their vehicle. I have some fog lights that I use on the back of my truck to light up the sides of my 5th wheel when I am pulling in to a camping spot at night. I got these so I can easly connect and disconnect these lights. They make it very easy to connect/disconnect anything you have that just needs power and ground. 
These things are awesome.  I bought two along with some relays and relay sockets so I could get them enough power directly from the battery to do serious audible damage.  Make sure to buy this one with its mate, the 72112 low tone.  After wiring in the relays, these went in my 2000 Civic perfectly.  They replaced the crappy horn in there, and I used the wiring to tie into the relay signal hot wire.  Then, I grounded the relay to the body by tying it into the ground wire from one of the horns.  The horns come with these little wire slide connectors that you can clamp onto your wires.  I used wire nuts to tie all the wires together - I suggest you do the same.  I was able to mount them facing away from eachother with grounding connectors in between the mounts using a single bolt that held the old Honda horn.  This was ideal, and very clean - no drilling required!I suggest finding yourself a 12V DC 4-pin or 5-pin 40 Amp SPST ISO Micro Relay for this project.  Also, it really helps to have a 5-Pin Wire Harness Relay Socket.  This will give you all the wires you need directly from the relay.  These are really cheap items, and you shouldn't have trouble finding them.  The 4-pin relays work fine with the 5-pin sockets.  Then, educate yourself on how relays work, and wire that bad boy up!  I got my relay and relay socket on ebay.Overall, I'm very pleased with this product.  Buy it now if you want to be heard on the highway. These things are awesome.  I bought two along with some relays and relay sockets so I could get them enough power directly from the battery to do serious audible damage.  Make sure to buy this one with its mate, the 72102 high tone.  After wiring in the relays, these went in my 2000 Civic perfectly.  They replaced the crappy horn in there, and I used the wiring to tie into the relay signal hot wire.  Then, I grounded the relay to the body by tying it into the ground wire from one of the horns.

One is 400Hz and the other one is 500Hz.PIAA | Automotive Sports Horn (400/500Hz) #85110The are exact fits on the mounts as the OEM horns and use the same bolts. A 1/4 inch drive ratchet and a 12mm socket is needed to remove and install the bolt. They came with grounding leads with ring spade lugs that mounted readily under the existing M6 bolts on the radiator supports. All you need is a 10mm socket.The two wiring harness leads are too short to connect the horns. Two wire tie mounts hold the harness to the aluminum bumper reinforcement. You can cut off the ties and use the OEM harness to connect the horns, but I chose not to.  I prefer NOT to cut off the OEM connector blocks.I made two pigtail extensions out of 18 gauge black primary wire, 5 inches long. One end needs a 1/4 inch wide exposed male quick disconnect. The other end needs an insulated female 1/4 inch quick disconnect terminal. Since I used 18 gauge wire, I used the red coded ones.The exposed male connector slides into the OEM horn connector perfectly. The female one clips easily onto the positive terminal of each horn.The horns how have a weather shield on the apertures.Best thing to my surprise is that they appear to be very high quality and Made in Japan.Also nice is that they need no modification to the horn relay or circuit. 
I got the yellow can to give my fog lights a vintage european look. I got the exact perfect color. Very pleased. The vinyl film you can buy is not the perfect amber color, but more of a cheap china lemon yellow. And the film reduces the light output by 20 % and is a pain to apply. Still, I needed 12 coats to get the tint I wanted. And you can only apply 5 coats in one hour. After that, according to the instructions, you must wait 7 days to add more coats. If your oven can go as low as 170, you can cure the paint for 90 minutes in the oven and then apply more coats. It doesn't  smell that bad. At the end, I got tired and tried to go heavy on the paint. Not good. It runs and you have to use 1500 grit sand paper to fix it. Not too bad, but still. After all that, I put 4 coats of Dupli-color clear wheel paint for extra protection. I know, they are just fogs and it's just a car. I guess I wanted memories of my youth when fog lighs were amber like they always should be. First, as with all of the Dupli-Color Metalcast paints, if you want the metalcast effect, you'll have to use the Dupli-Color Metalcast Ground Coat (MC100) on the surface before you apply the color or it will not come out right. The can says that it also comes out the same if you're painting directly onto chrome like surface but I have not tried this so I don't know. Now for this green. I'm more of a blue and purple guy for dark colors so only by my personal preference do I say that this green comes out just a tad light in color for me. Overall though, if you use the ground coat this comes out great with a nice metal sheen. I recommend this product. I washed my car thoroughly and then used a Meguiars polish - fine cut cleaner. I thought the polish was actually fantastic as it took out water spots and fine scratches as well. I was a little disappointed with the Carnauba Wax though. It was easy to use. Perhaps it needed two coats, but I was just plain beat ! It may just be that my paint is not the highest gloss ? That's a possibility. If that is the case, then I will be using Nu finish from now on for this vehicle. At $7.99 for a can in which the product itself will literally last a year with a very good shine, that's for me. I found that this wax left a shine similar to Meguiars NXT and that will last a year as well. This carnauba wax will probably last for 60-90 days or so if it is a normal carnauba wax.My Wife's car has a super gloss black paint and I may try this for that, however, I may not after being disappointed. I may just stick with the NXT Tech Wax. I will have to see how it shines up. 
I installed these on my 2005 GMC Envoy XL with brush guard and they work and look great. They really light up the offroad trails and remote roads at night. I used to have the very large Hella offroad lights and these are just as bright.Installation is no more or less difficult than other lights. There's no magic here - you have to run 12V and ground to the lights, the relay, to the battery, etc. They are nice bulbs, but don't last near as long as factory bulbs, and the headlights in a 2004 Dodge Ram are so poor, that not even these bright bulbs help.  I had to mount off road lights to use with my high beams, to take care of the problem.  I'm sure these bulbs are fine for other vehicles, but there's no hope for factory 2004 Ram headlights. I just made the switch from the traditional sealed beams on my E30 to some Hella H4's and H1's so I needed some bulbs that would emit a bright white light since I could do that in the new headlights. I almost went for the generic yellow bulbs that allegedly last longer, but I am so glad I didn't and spent a few extra pennies on these. They are so bright that when I combine them with the high beams which are also the same type of high performance bulbs these are, I can see almost a full mile down the highway at night. The generic sealed beams lit up the road well, but nowhere NEAR as much as these do.And for all of the people complaining and moaning about these high performace bulbs not lasting very long: DO NOT TOUCH THE GLASS OF THE BULB!!! This will allow the oil on your hands to get onto the bulb so when it heats up during operation, it heats it up even more, cracks the bulb, and there you have it. Roasted bulbs. So when you are handling them, I suggest you use rubber gloves and don't even THINK about touching the glass of the bulbs. Instead, handle the bulbs by the metal endings so you do will not crack the bulbs. Use your heads before you bash a high quality product and undermine its reputation. 
So easy to use and turn on and off. It dose not burn your hand like the others do when left out in the sun. This is a little red flashlight, period.  Yes, the red light is bright, and yes, it blinks if you set it to do so.  But this would NEVER take the place of a real flare under any circumstances.DO NOT buy this to replace the flares you should carry in your car emergency kit!!!!Most flashlights have the light beam coming straight out of the end of the tube.  This one has the light coming off the side, like a beacon or lighthouse.  It can ONLY be viewed from straight on!  While a flare puts out intense light in all directions (like a sparkler) this little flashlight only puts out light in one direction - the direction you have faced the beam.  DO NOT BUY, except as a toy, or as a hiking signal light - I have given it two stars for it being at least that useful.Flare?  No way. This rivet gun is a very good product. It works very well. Just don't forget to take the shaft of the rivet out of the gun after you use it. Just turn it upside down and it will fall out. 
This is one-size-fits-most. It works on the filter for my 2002 Volkswagen Passat, but it's too large to grip the filter on my 1993 Chevrolet S10. Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. This works great. It's sturdy and fit's nice and snug in a standard 5 gallon bucket. I will be ordering more of these in the future. 
These things give off a pretty wide pattern for being so small. they could be a tad bit brighter but they are a fog light which is exactly what i needed. Lights feel well made and sturdy. The wiring harness is very well made. Wire is of good quality and is fairly long however, the load wire that goes from the switch to the relay was not long enough and needed to be extended for my needs. The switch that comes with the kit is really nice and has an LED active light thats red when the lights are off and greeen when the lights are turned on, but i wont be using it.EDIT: CRAP! lights started to leak. seems like the weather stripping inside around the lens is way too big and doesnt seal right. took the lights off my front bumper and put them on my rear bumper to use as reverse lights since they didnt give me the light output desired. after almost of week of being on my rear bumper they filled up completely with water even worse than they did on my front bumper and one lens also cracked. going to contact the company or seller to see if i can get a replacement lens. READ ALL REVIEWS BEFORE PURCHASING. THESE LIGHTS ARE NOT THE GREATEST. This little item is a security blanket.  I use it to tend my two boat batteries while they sleep through the winter waiting for the walleyes to stir from their slumber beneath the ice.  I like the ability to use either the eyelet or clip connections, and I just keep the clips on them.  The advisory lights are clear to understand while charging or tending, and stay green as they sleep.  Each &#34;bank&#34; has its own light.  The device is small, too, and even has screw holes to allow the wall hanging or flat securing of the unit.  Love it. To stress what other reviewers have said, when you order this "2 Pack" you get what you see in the picture: two chocks, not two sets of chocks.This is a good light-duty set of chocks. They are lightweight, made of durable plastic, and are stackable (like they are in the picture) to save space. They are also bright orange so you don't forget about them when the job is done.The bottom of the chock is slightly serrated, which will give it a decent grip on concrete and asphalt - just make sure you wedge them in well. I would not use these chocks on an incline, on a soft or uneven surface or on a vehicle with a bad parking brake, but for all your normal uses these should do the trick.The two chocks come attached with a plastic fastener. It's a boar to remove, so a pair of pliers is recommended. If you look closely at the picture, you can see holes pre-molded into the lower end of the chock. If you want to keep the two connected but still easily separated for use, I recommend a short length of twine. 
This is not the exact same cable that comes with the ScanGauge from LinearLogic, but it does the job. I would buy it again. bought to change  coil springs on  a camaro they  arived very well  packaged  i would  say  any one  looking for  a set  to  buy  this set you  wont  be  sorry These were advertised as sold in a pair yet only one came.  I will need to order a second I guess.  They also appear plastic. 
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. Great Fit They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. 
To be honest, there are tons of these gap gauges around, made by all sorts of different companies. I dont actually think that this gap gauge is any better than the others, but it does its job, so it deserves 5 stars. On top of that, im dealing with iridium plugs, so you would need a gap gauge like this to do the job right. (the coin gap gauge will damage your precious metal!!!)Great stuff overall! I couldn't agree more with the pluses made by other reviewers; see any 5 star reviews.However, it has 1 major drawback as general purpose test leads.Lantern tipsThe head of the main probes is flared like a male banana jack, Fluke calls these 'lantern tip probes'.  This is helpful when inserting the jacks into banana females and for much electrical work, but when probing tight spaces like circuit components or feet of through hole DIP ICs, and worse on SMT components, lantern probes make the tips too wide, even if they are sharp.  Sometimes minigrabbers will work, but most times simple thin leads are all that's universally needed.Worst of all, you cannot insert these probes into a NEMA power socket to check the status of the hot or neutral lines, but it will fit the ground plug.  They are better for general electrical work for circular holes found in European style power sockets.In addition:PVCPVC is widely used, including as a low cost insulator for electrical wiring.  Alas, both in the EU and USA, there is a move to restrict its use for consumer products because its plasticizers is associated with major health issues; soft PVC [e.g. wires] is more a problem than hard PVC [e.g. drainage pipes].  Its not a problem for wires installed in homes, but as a test lead the user makes daily contact with PVC, or if ignited accidentally such as during a current surge or a solder iron misplacement, may release dioxin.Other than that, these leads are just as electrically good as a $50+ Fluke lead setFluke Corporation TL220 Industrial Test Lead Kit.What does >3x more cost get you?  The Fluke probe tips are the common thin design.  Fluke leads use silicone-rubber instead of PVC, a more expensive insulator that is lighter, and inert [its used from breast implants to tubing used in the food industry], more supple, soft, and easier to grip.  The Extech use PVC.  They are both electrically capable of CAT III-1000V rating and more, but the Fluke materials make probing with these leads repeatedly less taxing, something a professional electrician would notice with daily use.In September 2010, Extech released their own silicone test leads and kits.  It uses the standard thin probe tip, like Fluke.  A pair of the Extech leads alone cost as much as their entire PVC based test lead kit, so part of the Fluke's higher cost is at least in the materials. a regular 32mm socket will not fit in the space of my equinox. this is a kind of shorter 32mm socket designed only for oil filter cap job. it works fine. 
Made in China poor quality item that does not befit the Robert Bosch brand at all.Not for winter for sure.The origin of the product should be stated at the product page.If I knew it were a MADE-IN-CHINA I would not have bought it. The filter still gets a good rating by most automotive experts but it is NO longer made in the USA and to me that's disappointing. Have not used it yet but the feel and quality in your hand speaks for itself, quality product MADE IN THE USA makes me proud there is still some of this out there in this great country. Have had Milton air products before and they are the BEST of the BEST and worth the difference you may have to pay, in the long haul the difference in price is really cheaper, they are pretty well built to last most of our life times.*BUY USA FOLKS* 
A must have to replace oxygen sensors. Makes the process so easy that even a caveman can do it. The sensors were in a unreachable spot to use a wrench so this socket really came in handy. I needed to replace the inner tie rod on my 97 Corolla. I have a fairly well equiped shop but needed this specialty tool to do the job.This tool allowed me to remove the inner tie rod lock nut with ease. It has several difference sizes of fittings that allow it to be used on other vehicles.This tool paid for itself by me doing the job. It is well made and worth the price. I was hoping to use the clay bar to remove water spots on a new truck but the one provided with this Mequiar's kit was worthless for this purpose. The kit does include everything you need to apply the products in the kit which is a plus and probably the reason the kit is so popular. 
Don't buy this rear wiper for a 1st generation xB, it will NOT fit! Get OEM or a wiper from elsewhere! I use it everyday primarily for a storage cover.  I have not had the cover on the bike in rain or weather.  I got the XL for my CBR500R with full large rear bags and windshield.  I can lock my helmet to the rear seat area put the cover on and it will cover up the entire bikes exhaust and 3/4 of the rear tire and entire front tire.  Two bungies mid bike and front tire enable hokking cover under bike.  Very sturdy and breathable with exhaust panels (silver durable material) and inner windshield liner.  Much bang for the buck. Would certainly purchase another if I had to without question. Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars

I don't need a gallon of this stuff.  I don't need a quart.  I don't even need a pint... so this was the perfect size to have on hand for occaional small engine reassembly and repair. Another must have for the tool box.This is one of the best quality grease available. I only bought one tube because I don't need it often but when I do, its just a small amount. Have not yet needed to use them, bought them for when I do need them. I am however, very impressed with the quality of the cables. The bag they came in is durable, handy, convenient & good quality. The price was outstanding for these cables. They are low profile to ensure that they do not rub on the wheel well. Only issue I had, was attempting to purchase another set of the rubber tensioner in case one breaks. Amazon did not seem to offer more than one size, which of course was not the size I needed. Most reviews caution you to have an extra, or you could find yourself in trouble if one side breaks. So if anyone knows where to buy extra tensioners, please let me know. 
Fits my low clearance Mazda 5 that comes with alloy wheels and 3/4 inches of clearance between the inside of the tire and the suspension.  Have not tried it in the snow yet. the bag it came with dosent fit it, if youve got it adjusted to the middle or top setting, this does exactley what they say, seems pretty rugged, it fits my duratrac 245/75/16s perfect and holds my 225lb self no prob. Fit my '98 Nissan Frontier's oil pan perfectly. Looks to be of nice quality.  Torque to 25ft/lbs (on the Frontier anyway)

We received these and they work very well. Make sure that you measure the distance between the wheels and the size of the wheel because there are two different sizes. They work much better than wheel chocks. They are a bit slick and need to be sand blasted or something. I would not buy these for any Tire size 15 inch or smaller. Get a 4x4 , cut it, use it. Bought this because I wanted to measure the length of a specific body part of mine.  Unfortunately a ruler was too big to measure the length of it.  I needed something very small in order to figure out how long it is. 
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. As the title says - perfect fit for 2005 Jeep Liberty taillights.  Hardest part is getting the entire taillight assembly out which once you know how is a no-brainer. They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. 
This little compressor has far exceeded my expectations. I have had two plumbed to an air tank that ran air tools on my rig. They run forever and have never gave me a problem. The only thing I would suggest is to switch out the male hose adaptor. This will allow you to run a regular sized higher quality hose that can attach to regular air tools/hoses in a pinch. The one that comes with it is an odd ball size. Don't get me wrong...you can't run air tools directly from this compressor. But using two into a tank makes it possible. I would buy another one in a heart beat. A little noisy but what compressor isn't?! It pushed a decent amount of air for the money. You need one for your vehicle so just buy it. Just like fire needs oxygen, heat, and fuel, cars become roadblocks withoug gas, battery, and air.  You can carry more gas, and a second battery / electrical system, but air is hard to find, and with "service" stations removing it from their offerings of yesteryear, you need to have your own air system.What impressed me most about this compressor was the attachment point to the valvestem.  It is threaded and screws on, forming a seal during refil.  This seal is exceptional - good enough that the guage mounted on the compressor itself is accurate to set your tire pressure at the other end of the hose.  If you are filling a big tire, it will take some time, so this lets you sit back and relax while the motor works.  My tire chucks for shop air all require constant finger pressure to ensure a seal - not having to get tire chuck thumb was a nice side benefit!As for portable inflation systems, I've grown tired of anything with a cigarette lighter plug as the power source.  It's limited to 10 AMPs which gives you roughly 130-140 watts of power.  740 would be a full horsepower.  This compressor under load can draw 30 amps at 13V, for 390 watts - more than a half horsepower.  To do that they use clipon cable back to the battery.  Because I carry a second battery I clip on to it for the juice to run this.  It will also work with your main starting battery if you don't have a backup elecrical source.In the box you will find a carrying bag as well as an octogonal shaped piece of plastic - thats the air input filter - you need to screw it onto the air inlet to protect the compressor.  Its a quality unit so it needs protection.When all is said and done you have a 1/2 hp 12VDC compressor that gives you the freedom to set your tire pressure when and where you want to.  With the fast fill rate it takes very little time to top off your tires, if you want to drop your pressure for sand offroad and then refill it later when you hit asphalt this is a small but valuable tool to have in your emergency kit.The unit has a well balanced carrying handle to take it between tires and is light weight enough to take with you everywhere.  While you can use your car's starting battery, a second battery will prevent you from draining your starting battery.  When done, start up and drive away.If you seriously go offroad consider a highjack lift to get you out of a bind, or else a hydraulic system with a portable cylinder fed from your engine's hydraulic pump (if yours is equipped with one) or a secondary hydraulic system powered by your secondary electrical system - with all this you will not be stuck for long!Finally maintaining your tire pressure at proper levels for your load optimizes your fuel efficiency - at $3+ / gallon for fuel these days your efforts will pay for themselves shortly.While I have a 240VAC compressor in my shop, this is the first honest 12VDC compressor that does not take forever to fill a tire.  With a half horsepower air cooled motor it does the job quite well.  It's worth the money to keep onboard. I used this tool to winterize our travel trailer.  Simply screw it on to your water hook-up, and then attach your standard air adaptor to your compressor hose - and presto - you're in business.The tip is flexible, but secure.  That is, after connecting your air hose to this plug, you can tip the hose in any of 360-degress, and it will flex.  This is great, because in colder weather a more rigid adaptor might break.I would recommend this plug for anyone that wants to winterize their RV, and I would purchase it again. 
Also had some baked on oil stains on  tti ceramic coated headers on our 70 challenger caused by leaking rear main seal. Once repaired tried semichrome to remove them. No success at all.  Again pulled out the mother's,,,,although slow and tedious, it did the job with no damage to ceramic coating.Screw on lid on mother's makes far better sense.  Semichrome lid requires an inconvenient  pry tool to remove,,,,which tends to clobber lid causing it to not seal well.  Additionally semichrome is somewhat on the order as twice as expensive.  I should have purchased a tube instead of a can to give it a try,,,would have saved 15 or so dollars. I bought this wrench to remove the oil filters on my arctic cat quads.  I can never get them off and have resorted to punching holes in them with a screwdriver and then turning the screwdriver to remove the filter.  This wrench worked like a charm and I no longer have to tear  up the oil filter to remove it. Using a little Permatex Dielectric grease on the spark plug connectors will help remove them later as well as sealing out moisture. 
Fits my low clearance Mazda 5 that comes with alloy wheels and 3/4 inches of clearance between the inside of the tire and the suspension.  Have not tried it in the snow yet. This works exactly as you expect. If your gap is too small, you can just slightly tilt the entire gauge while measuring the gap, and the gap will extend some... that is, measure, push to extend, re-measure, and repeat until you have the right gap.You can also use the inside of the small ring area to expand the gap. This is where I think the tool could improve. The small edge of the wedge on the inner ring could be smaller. Once, I happened to tap my gap too small to fit on that wedge, and had some trouble getting the gap to open back up enough to again work on the gauge.All in all, though, this is a necessity in my motorcycle tool bag. They only fit around a standard thickness roll bar not the newer jeep arrangement with the plastic cover shroud of the late models. 
This air gauge is dead on accurate, it seals completely, allows air to flow the way it should and the two headed chuck fit all cars, trucks and even those pesky hard to reach motorcycle valve stems. I own three motorcycles and there is nothing more aggravating than trying to fit a chuck in between rotors, fork tubes and tight spaces on a motorcycle. You know what I mean. This two headed angled chuck is angled perfectly to fit over a cycle stem without leaking or having to bend the valve stem. I love it. This tool is perfect for solo bleeding brakes. All you do is attach it to a bottle/jar/container via some adapters and tubing and then bleed away without the fear of getting air back into the brake lines.The only tiny problem is that the tubing attached to the bleeder screw is a air tight one way check valve so when you take it off a large amount of brake fluid is trapped on the intake side of the tube and if your not careful may make quite a mess on the calipher. I wish they included some button on the tool to open the check valve fully to allow the excess fluid trapped in the tubing to flow downward into the container to minimize the chances to make a mess. Eventually.  If the O2 sensor leaves mangled threads, this will clean them up without having to pull the manifold.  Great tool 
OEM quality, as mentioned, made in Japan.  The only gripe is the OEM cap has Honda screws that are have washer locks on them to keep them on the cap and thus less likely to drop while removing them.  The replacement screws are separate.  The cap also comes with a replacement gasket.TIP:  Always replace plug wires one at a time from the old cap to the new cap in the same order/rotation you pull from.May as well replace the rotor and coil while you are at it:Beck Arnley  173-7988  Ignition RotorOEM 5100A Ignition Coil I should have gotten the Honda cap.  This fits OK, but the screws are not "captured" in the cap.  With the original cap,the screws cannot fall out.  Considering the position of the screws when mounting this, captured screws are an advantage. A little 1/2 ounce tube at the parts store was almost 5 bucks. this is great for exhaust manifold bolts and where heat and rust are a problem. Comes with an applicator brush attached to the cap. Can use on all bolts, never have to worry about breaking another bolt cause it welded itself to the thread. a must for auto enthusiasts. 
We put these on the awning on our 5th wheel, you need a ladder and it takes awhile to slide them all in the track. The other downside is you have to take the S hooks out every time you roll it up, if you get caught in a pop up storm good luck! But once they are up they work great. I use this on all of our tires.  The best time to use it is when they are brand new.  Drive the freshly mounted tires home, make sure they're clean, and then apply this.  Using sponge type applicators I apply one thick coat on each wheel and then go around the car again to apply a second coat.  Park it in the sun for a few hours.  The longer it sits the better.  Rub off all of the excess with another sponge type applicator or whatever you prefer.  Drive the vehicle a few miles and then wipe off any that may have got thrown off onto your paint and make sure to wipe any streaks on the tires themselves also.This stuff lasts for a long time if applied properly and instead of being washed away it makes the water bead on your tires and slide right off.  It keeps your tires looking deep black and shiny instead of the dull grey that many become.I use this 3 or 4 times a year and it keeps the look that I really like and I get questions and compliments on how I keep my tires like that quite often. I Love it  . Takes a while to break in until then you may get some wax streaks and not pick up all the dust but within a month it is perfect and like they say only improves the dirtier it becomes just shake off outside before putting back in the case and stuffing it in the trunk or map pocket . 
Inexpensive, yet works as good as the ones sold by Honda dealerships. Made true to specs and fits right into the slot on my Accord 2006.Will buy again. Exact replacement from OEM. Exact fit worked perfect . Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs. Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars 
Fits my low clearance Mazda 5 that comes with alloy wheels and 3/4 inches of clearance between the inside of the tire and the suspension.  Have not tried it in the snow yet. ...fits my 1973 Chevy/GMC 4x4 steering wheel perfect. Stretch it over the wheel and wrap the vinyl string around it nice and tight. The vinyl will break so just stretch it a little. They only fit around a standard thickness roll bar not the newer jeep arrangement with the plastic cover shroud of the late models. 
the bag it came with dosent fit it, if youve got it adjusted to the middle or top setting, this does exactley what they say, seems pretty rugged, it fits my duratrac 245/75/16s perfect and holds my 225lb self no prob. Fit my '98 Nissan Frontier's oil pan perfectly. Looks to be of nice quality.  Torque to 25ft/lbs (on the Frontier anyway) These things are rated 8,000lbs but that's for ( GVW ) so while it's correct technically in reality each item is rated by the label at 2,000lbs per each item and if you had 4 (they sell them in pairs), if you had 4 of them you could put 8,000lbs on them, technically and according to them.****I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO RELY ON USER REVIEWS TO GET THE INDIVIDUAL WEIGHT RATING!!!!***GVW is a very deceptive and dangerous way to market and label these products.  Consider this, on a truck, the majority of the weight is on the front two wheels while the rear wheels don't have as much weight - same is true on a front wheel vehicle.  This leads to situations where you could overextend the capacity of these products.I'd like a very clear rating: 2,000lbs, 4,000lbs, 6,000lbs for each stand or ramp on Amazon so that I know how much weight I can safely put on it similar to what is found on jacks....a jack is not labeled as 6,000lbs if it can lift a 6,000GVW vehicle, 6,000lbs means that the jack can lift 6,000lbs!After all, I'm planning to get under these things!!!!On items like this where someone's life very literally depends on the labeling ---  it would be really really really nice (and a legal requirement) that the specifications on Amazon very clearly stated both the operating weight, maximium weight, and crush (failure) weight per each ramp/stand versus this GVW rating which is deceptive and just plain dangerous.I have very literally found people working underneath 8,000lbs trucks without the wheels using jack stands sold as "2ton" when in reality each jack stand was only rated at 1ton or 2,000lbs.....their comment back, "this is a 2 ton stand and 8,000lbs GVW divided by 4 is 2,000lbs or 1ton, plenty of margin."  When in reality 6,000lbs are up front....3,000lb for each wheel  and each stand rated at only 2,000lbs....making their jack stand 150% overloaded! --- horrendously scary (all because marketing is so bad in this area).  Yes people should exercise care in using double protection and users should Always read their instructions and warning before putting their life on the line -- but for the love of God, there is a responsibility on the makers and marketers of these products to label them very clearly and in bold with the weight that EACH can hold and Amazon should post that weight for each item in BOLD Yellow or Orange wording with very clear warnings.Amazon and automotive sellers on Amazon need to get on the ball regarding the needs of auto ethusiasts and for the safety of the weekend mechanic who should not have to do complex math to figure out how much weight each item can hold!We REALLY need to get away from GVW, it's deceptive and dangerous!****I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO RELY ON USER REVIEWS TO GET THE INDIVIDUAL WEIGHT RATING!!!!*** 
work great for my John Deere X500 Perfect for exhaust work.  I bought it for a catalytic converter and o2 sensor project because it is rated for: -30F to 1800F Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. 
I have an old 55 GMC with a Napco 4wd on 37 inches tires and it stands pretty high. Even getting to the oil dip stick is a challenge without a step.That tire step is really great, it unfolds and installs in 2 seconds over the tire. It fits my 37x12.5 (it won't work with a bigger tire) and is pretty stable.It comes with a nice pouch with handles to carry it with you everywhere you go. It folds nicely and can be stored under your seat. A really great item, and I am considering buying a 2nd one so that I can have one on each side when I am working in the engine bay of the truck. Fits a little tight especially around the front fender and floorboards but it works.  I have a 03' Shadow ACE 750cc.  After a couple rain storms I can report my bike stayed dry (except a portion of the front wheel) and through heavy winds, the motorcycle cover stayed put.  What&#8217;s nice about this cover is the price and how it has elastic hooks to secure the cover in place.  If you decide to buy a cover and your bike has a windshield, floor boards and aftermarket mirrors I recommend you buy a 2XL (if your bike is similar in size to a Shadow 750cc).  Look at the picture I posted, mine has stock mirrors and no windshield and fits VERY tight.  My mirrors shift out of place when the cover is on.  Before each ride I have to adjust them cause the cover is soo tight.  Also, if you have floor boards that&#8217;ll make the fit even more tighter.  Buying one size bigger and I would say you bike will be 100% covered. This sunshade is easy to use and folds up to a nice compact size that fits under my seat well. It's a quite large size so is made for an SUV or car that has a large windshield like my Toyota Prius. While it doesn't fit the Prius perfectly, it's the closest size to being perfect.At this price, I have no complaints with this and can recommend it. 
Purchased this as an OE replacement per the factory manual for a Honda powered snow thrower and it works just fine! Bought this to use withValterra F02-4100 45 RV Hydroflushso I could wash out my tanks.Here is my review of that setuphttp://www.amazon.com/Valterra-F02-4100-45%C2%B0-RV-Hydroflush/product-reviews/B0002UHVAA/ref=cm_cr_dp_synop?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints;=0&sortBy;=bySubmissionDateDescending#R2CUAU2B8XC98QIt works great.I also like that I have this as an emergency backup if one of my valves ever fails. Great price and fast delivery from Amazon! The HU-925 DOES fit the 2006 BMW 325 Ci Convertible ('06 was an oddity by BMW with both E46 and E90 models) - don't make the same mistake I did and relied just on Amazon's order guide which stated the HU-814 was the oil filter to get - I believe BMW's transition between the E46 to E90 within Model year 2006 didn't quite make it into Amazon's ordering S/W. 
i use this lube all around the house....door hinges, oven hinges, key locks, sliding door tracks etc.works nicely and doesnt leave a visual layer....dries invisible Great wheel lock that is easy to activate and unlock.  It comes with 3 keys, one of which has a LED light on it.  The product also comes with a reminder cord that attaches to the handle bar as a reminder.  It does just what I was looking for. My husband installed this in 5 minutes and it really does work like a charm. Keeps that door from blowing open and banging shut. 
installed the unit in an BMW e46 320D Wagon and the unit works ok... but sometimes you get that wiper switch slap you dont with other brands.... install Valeo brand instead if you can..! Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars Don't buy this rear wiper for a 1st generation xB, it will NOT fit! Get OEM or a wiper from elsewhere! 
This filter worked great on my 2003 Chevy Silverado with a 5.3l even though Amazon says it doesn't!!!  It's a Original Equipment (O.E.) filter, so that's another plus in Quality!!! How to I know for sure of the correct filter.  I have a Alldata.com subscription for my truck.  5 years was like $[...], so a great deal.  I get access to everything I need to know on my truck.  How to do things, Hours it'll take to do a job, O.E. Part Numbers and prices, etc..  So I looked up Fuel Filter, and it told me the O.E. part number for the filter is 25171792 looking that up on Google, I find that Number crosses over to the GF652 Filter.  From this web site, [...]Sure enough it fit just fine.  Though the filter that was on it was a GF-626! Which was the Original on my truck.  I guess there has been a Number change.  Just to make sure once again, I checked directly from ACDelco for a fuel filter for my Truck.  You can check it out here [...]  and then click on Parts Catalog!!  Anyway sure enough it also shows the GF652 fuel filter for my truck!!!It's a filter, what's to say?  ACDelco filters are quality filters.  Can't go wrong with installing another O.E. filter onto your Car/Truck!  Since I changed out the Cooled in my truck for the first time in the 7 years I've had it, the Dex-Cool coolant still looked great.  I drained and changed the coolant with a 50/50 blend coolant, so I wouldn't have to use tap water, or have to buy Distilled Water!!!  This is how you get coolant to last a long time.  Not Contaminating with Tap Water!!!  Anyway, Did Coolant change, Oil change, Oil Filter change, Fuel Filter Change and Air filter change.  I have about 39,000 miles on my truck.  Normal Maintenance type stuff.  It's on it's 3rd AC Compressor, so AC system is Good, New belts when that work was done. I have over 40 years experience with transmission coolers -- and the B&M; "Stacked Plate" Transmission Coolers are STILL the best in the business !!I recently installed a #70268 Model in my restored 1995 Mercury Grand Marquis (V-8, Automatic Trans), and the improvements are distinctly noticeable. The lower transmission fluid temperatures make the transmission work more smoothly, especially with the quicker, sharper up-shifts and the firm down-shifts, too !!All the hardware was included, and the installation was quick and easy.Other reviewers have recommended routing your cooler lines to the Tranny Cooler FIRST, but that is completely WRONG -- ALL transmission cooler manufacturers, as well as Ford Motor Company, tell us to route the cooler lines to the RADIATOR FIRST -- and they tell us this because THEY KNOW from decades of experience and thousands of installations on ALL types of vehicles that the Coolers work BEST when routed to the RADIATOR FIRST !!When installing a tranny cooler, it's a good idea to drop the Tranny Pan and change the Tranny Filter --  I added a B&M; Drain Plug Kit to make future transmission service easier.You CAN'T go wrong if you just follow B&M;'s clear and complete instructions  !!I did NOT use the Nylon anchor straps through the radiator-- instead hanging the cooler about 2.5 inches forward of the AC Condenser -- with the hose fittings pointing UP, as recommended by B&M.; Mounting the cooler with the fittings at the TOP will assure that the ENTIRE trans cooler surface is being utilized.With cooler properly installed, the transmission now runs at 175-180 degrees @ 75-80 mph -- with outside air  temps of 100+ degrees F.Valvoline Synthetic Transmission Fluid has given me great service after many years of desert and mountainous driving -- I recommend it highly -- with NO additives !!~~~ MOST IMPORTANT !! ~~~ After installation, BE SURE to fill transmission fluid to the proper level -- add fluid only 4 ounces at a time, check again, and DO NOT OVER-FILL !! Too much fluid leads to aeration and certain transmission failure !!Good Luck !! California 2000 V6 Camry with P1150 and P1155. Two of my code tables show as Bank 1 Sensor 2 A/F sensor so I ordered the Denso 234-4209 O2 sensor. Came in on time and package well protected but looks like its the wrong one - my fault, somewhat. Turns out, as far as I could tell, my two tables from two different sources had it backwards as it should be Bank 2 Sensor 1 A/F and Denso/Amazon order check didn't help much either.Anyway, Bank 2 Sensor 1 is the one on the engine right front (easy to get to) where Denso refer as Upstream Front. I gave it 5 stars base on previous experience, will order this one later.Why the a few of you refer as Bank 1 Sensor 1 and still corrected the check engine light? That would not be this one for the the Toyota V6 but Denso 234-9007 where they refer as Upstream Rear. Am I wrong?Seems like I'm not the only one confused based on superceeded information on P1150 and P1155.This one is for Bank 2 Sensor 1 for the Toyota V6 engine (mine is the 1MZFE). 
bought this to attach to my car battery, and black and decker BM3B 6V & 12V charger. It plugs in nicely, and charges. This is the standard connector for all brands of battery maintainer. I use this w/ solar panels to keep tractor,ATV and Pop Up traiter batterries charged. Be sure solar charger has a anti-drain diode on it. I also reccomend Yuasa battery maintainer. This makes it easy to disconnect and go w/o the insecurity of clamps and eliminates misconnects.. A nice charger. Is also smaller than it appears on the picture. So easy to carry and handle.Unfortunately I had to send it back because it just has the standard clamps to charge.There were no &#34;Quick Disconnect Extension&#34; option to easy plug-n-charge a motorcycle.So I bought the &#34;Black & Decker BM3B 6V and 12V Battery Charger / Maintainer&#34;:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051D3MP6/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0 
bought this to attach to my car battery, and black and decker BM3B 6V & 12V charger. It plugs in nicely, and charges. This is a very nice charger for many batteries, BUT it states AGM (not good for many). An AGM 12VDC VMAX, or Optima type RV or marine battery requires a special charger that will deliver 25-35 Amps, not 8. This is for a very small AGM battery. This cost over $120 and I will use it for regular flooded lead batteries but must buy another for AGM or Gel batteries for my RV. A specialty battery requires a specialty charger, I found out. I do recommend this, would buy again, and I hope this helps. This O2 sensor was a direct replacement for the original part.  Wire was the correct length and wires/plug matched original perfectly.  Easy install and I have seen a few MPG increase in fuel economy since installation.  The replacement of these sensors will also help ensure longer catalytic converter life.  Very happy with this purchase.

PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars Bought for my new Corvette.  Chevy sells a similar (if not the same0 product for a much higher price.  The CTEK web site shows this unit brand labeled for BMW, Audi, Maserati and Lamborghini so it may well be the unit Chevy buys brand labeled.It has a 4 mode charging system.  The last is a pulsed maintenance mode so it can be kept on all the time for when the car will not be used for several weeks.  Well-made and comes with a bag to hold it and the accessories, that I put on a pegboard hook in the garage. I think there are too many nozzle adapter on this unit and Black & Decker forgot the Presta adapter which is used by bikers to inflate their road bikes. This would only cost cents for Black and Decker to add the adapter and many road bikers would buy this product.Another modification that Black & Decker could add to this product that will make this popular among road bikers and car drivers is to incorporate a schraeder and a presta hole adapter to the inflating end of the unit. I have seen some hand pump models that already have this innovation. 
These caps fit on top of the Tri Lynx levelers (Tri Lynx 00015 (10)  Lynx Leveler) or by themselves, for under stabilizer jacks or the hitch jack (if you have a light trailer).  They can also be used on top of the levelers, for under the tire(s) to level your RV.  I don't know how much weight they can bare, but they do well with my 3,400lb trailer for all of the uses described above. Not rating it high because it will not work on a Openrange lite fifth wheel hitch.  The hitch on these lite's are like a goose-neck hitch which allows to make 90 degree turns in a short wheelbase truck.  The hitch comes down to far and there isn't enough clearance between the hitch and the ground.  The legs would be spread too far out to give any type of support.  What I did was put it under the large bracket that hold the hitch and that did work pretty good.  You cannot attach it to the ball, but overall it seems to control a little of the rocking motion of the trailer. The item itself is built sturdy and I would have rated it a 5 but it not for every fifth wheel hitch. I like that this can be installed on multiple hitch balls, so if a new vehicle requires a higher or lower hitch height I can just move this to the new hitch. 
Great tool for clamping hard to reach radiator hose clamps.  Its multi-position locking mechanism will make sure to clamp and hold various sized clamps- unlike other pliers that can only hold in the fully close position. I should have gotten the Honda cap.  This fits OK, but the screws are not "captured" in the cap.  With the original cap,the screws cannot fall out.  Considering the position of the screws when mounting this, captured screws are an advantage. The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around! 
Need one say more?  And, these can be locked in place using a small lock you put in the tightening head (lock not included).  Once in place between the wheels on a tandem axle trailer, there's no way the trailer will move.  Cool! I found out by accident that on my RV, you can simply push down on the round "handle" that is on the slider, and that will open the door. So at least for my RV ( 2012 Keystone Springdale TT ) this device is not needed. You might want to try it on yours too. This was not in any manual that came with my RV, but it is clearly designed to work this way. The slider is spring loaded in the vertical dimension. This little gadget keeps my lift handle paired up nicely when mounted to my vehicle. It can get in the way when jacking, but it is easily solved by just pulling it up onto the d hook on the top. 
Works great for drying the car quickly and easily when its not hot enough out to do it quickly, and you don't wanna have to polish out all the water spots afterwords (Black car). This thing absorbs so much water you won't believe it till you use it, and it just takes a beating and keeps on going. When I first used it I was afraid I was gonna rip it by twisting the water out too hard, nope, just keep wringing it out until its dry and continue on.A little secret to using it, at least I've found it to work better this way. When drying the car, lay the Absorber out flat (unfold it across the surface) and then grasp it at one end at each corner and drag it slowly across the car allowing it to absorb all the water it comes into contact with. This works especially well on horizontal surfaces, but still good enough on the vertical ones as well. This practice also helps to prevent scratching of the surface when small particles get trapped between the chamois and the paint surface and then your hand comes and pushes it right into the paint.Little warning, when it comes, don't smell it. Mine reeeeekkkkkeeedddd! But I just rinsed it out and the smell went away. Yes it is true that you can put it right back into the tube wet (Well to get it back in the tube, you must, because you can't roll it once it dry), but I like to leave the top off of the tube to allow air in there to dry it out before I close it up and that musty gross smell comes back.Long story short: Get it, you won't be disappointed. I really like this item, especially with having young kids. My kids were constantly opening the screen door slide and letting bugs in and out. With this they can open the screen door without having to open the slide. This allows them to go in and out faster and helps keep bugs out. So you drop it in your bucket and go about your business.  When you dunk your rags or brushed the dirt and grit settles to the bottom out of the way and you can keep right on cleaning without changing out the water so often.  I love this thing.  Wish I had it growing up. 
A well made piece. This brush is not too stiff and the ice scrapper part is located on the opposite side of the handle (convenient if you only need to brush off the show or leaves). Rubberized handle allows for a good, solid grip. Lightweight. These are typical hard plastic handles, contoured for grip. The stock bar is substantial at 7/16". Edges are finished nicely. The metal shaft is unpolished and has a finish to prevent slippage.I don't care if all my hand tools are the same color, if it matters to you then note these may come in a different color than illustrate (see my pics).Made in the U.S.A. - nice.j Far too flimsy. This thing feels like it needs to be packed to the gills in order to retain its rectangular shape. Would also appreciate some type of rubber/velcro grip on the bottom so it's not sliding around in my trunk when lightly loaded.It does it's job, hence the no-return, but at the same time I didn't expect &#34;soft sided&#34; to mean &#34;collapsable in all situations except fully loaded. 
would recommend getting a  size  smaller than  what the  &#34;sizing chart&#34; recommends  as  I  measure aroun my leg  as  recommended  and  the chaps  were  one size too large.. otherwise they are  awesome  quality and build Sizes listed in reviews and the two in the description (15.8 x 10.5 x 5, and 12.5 x 9.5 x 7) don't match to what I received...The bag I received is in between what has been listed in the descriptions:  13.5" x 9" x 6" (empty).While seemingly a good quality bag, with a fair amount of straps and attached rain-cover (hidden in the heel of the bag), it seems the manufacturer (or seller) has no idea how to use a measuring tape!The bag itself is quite nice... good padding, rubberized bottom to prevent sliding, small pockets on either side, and zippers seem of reasonable quality.For the price and bag quality, I'm not complaining.  It works great on my CB750, and it does fit on the pillion of my VT1100c2 (without having to remove my rider backrest)  So if you have standard seating (or a touring/adventure style), this bag will do well for you as a pillion bag, and with a little strap adjustments, it also fits vertical on the front or back of a sissy-bar, or horizontal on a larger luggage rack... The size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous. The funnel is 10" long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6" long. It states that the funnel is 4" x 4" but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2-1/4" in diameter at the widest point.It would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless. 
A well made piece. This brush is not too stiff and the ice scrapper part is located on the opposite side of the handle (convenient if you only need to brush off the show or leaves). Rubberized handle allows for a good, solid grip. Lightweight. Truly an impressive assembly of 4 parts. If there is a finer example of a little piece of rubbery roll-y wheel attached to a wooden handle with some metal parts in the middle tying it all together, show me. The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable.

Each time you grab the gauge you will appreciate the cover and it does help protect it as well. Although it looks to be made with a thick sturdy plastic shell, mine came misaligned. I had to unscrew it and reset the 2 halves together. Functionally, everything seems to work but time will only tell how it will hold up. Also the company logo peels off pretty easily. 
Easy to install, be sure and read the directions, was a good fit and installation was easy. Fits well on my 2012 Jeep Wrangler. I bought this to go on the back of our camper bumper.  Very well built and easy to install.  Easy to adjust if needed.  Highly recommend!!!! Super easy to install.  The only tool was a small screwdriver to remove the old one.  This one just snaps into place 
Installed in my IS 350. Could have used another few square feet, but it is easy to install once you remove all the carpet, spare tire and rear deck lid factory insulation. Don't forget the license plate and fuel door. Clipped onto the doorlock and door latch rods securely and installed onto the inner door release handle nice and firm.  Worked perfectly. Superstrong epoxy. I used this to repair a broken pot metal chassis of a Hot Wheels monster truck die cast car. The grey color of the JB Weld blended in nicely with the metal die cast chassis and the epoxy has held up nicely. 
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. This is one-size-fits-most. It works on the filter for my 2002 Volkswagen Passat, but it's too large to grip the filter on my 1993 Chevrolet S10. It a belt... it fits, it hold and it rotates. There is no noise coming from it.Happy with the fit and performance.

Perfect for exhaust work.  I bought it for a catalytic converter and o2 sensor project because it is rated for: -30F to 1800F Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars I welded a piece of flat stock on the insert for the motorhome. This adapter is for my Dodge Grand Caravan. 
These item does fit perfect on my 2004 BMW x3. does what its suppose to do. so far so good thanks fits my car perfectly, works perfectly, was easy to install. The best measure of a wiper blade is that it does what it is supposed to do, when it is supposed to do it. Can't complain; it works perfectly and as advertised however, i should have done my homework.  it doesn't fit my rear disk... it only fits the front.

Perfect for exhaust work.  I bought it for a catalytic converter and o2 sensor project because it is rated for: -30F to 1800F I have previously used in: 1980 Honda CX500C to fix a rough idle, 2000 Suzuki SV650 to stabilize fuel, and a 2005 Chevy Cobalt to fix a problem with stalling at idle. I purchased this belt for my 2003 Chevy Tahoe. I had no idea Chevy would put 2 serpentines on a newer generation vehicle. This smaller belt fits the A/C system only. It works like a champ and fits perfectly. I would recommend the Gatorback belts to EVERYONE! As an installation side note, you have to remove the air intake and larger serpentine to get to this "bottom of the motor" mounted unit.... way to engineer that one GM! 
I use it everyday primarily for a storage cover.  I have not had the cover on the bike in rain or weather.  I got the XL for my CBR500R with full large rear bags and windshield.  I can lock my helmet to the rear seat area put the cover on and it will cover up the entire bikes exhaust and 3/4 of the rear tire and entire front tire.  Two bungies mid bike and front tire enable hokking cover under bike.  Very sturdy and breathable with exhaust panels (silver durable material) and inner windshield liner.  Much bang for the buck. Would certainly purchase another if I had to without question. I use this on the back window of my Jeep Grand Cherokee. It does not flex enough to have full contact on the window. It only has about 8&#34; of contact. I will not purchase this again. Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend.

My 2003 Silverado 1500 5.3 V* owners manual called for a GF626.....This is the EXACT same fit and goes on  easy. Save a bundle from Stealerships......AMAZON is the  BEST for OEM parts.....This is a quality AC DELCO filter and solid... I am installing these on a 02 chevy avalanche 1500 5.3L v8. they are a exact replacement of oem. AC Delco all the way... good stuff. You can't say much about this quick disconnect plug. But one for sure: having it installedcharging your motorcycle is much easier than using those old fashioned alligator clamps.If you also interested in buying a battery maintainer the harness is included in this one:&#34;Black & Decker BM3B 6V and 12V Battery Charger / Maintainer&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051D3MP6/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0You may also like to hear that there is a adapter available from SAE-2-USB plug available:&#34;SAE to USB Adapter - Motorcycle Cell Phone Charger&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007VFFQRE/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1So if you also use a navigation system while riding you can easily charge this on the road. 
Great price and fast delivery from Amazon! The HU-925 DOES fit the 2006 BMW 325 Ci Convertible ('06 was an oddity by BMW with both E46 and E90 models) - don't make the same mistake I did and relied just on Amazon's order guide which stated the HU-814 was the oil filter to get - I believe BMW's transition between the E46 to E90 within Model year 2006 didn't quite make it into Amazon's ordering S/W. Exaclty the same as the OEM filter I dug out of the glove box. This one was the exact same but so much cheaper. exactly what I needed for my 2001 Acura MDX to eliminate the annoying intermittent Check Engine lightcheaper than getting it from Honda/Acuraworks just the same 
Bad design...  The two doors that cover the  hose and charger cords are not hinged or tethered, can easily be misplaced. Battery has been overheating during charging and has melted the bottom of the unit.  LED indicators show low battery charge.I do not trust it.  I will keep it as long as the pump works. It does what it is supposed to do, that is to increase placement distance from the car to the electrical outlet does what its supposed to do. it carry's gas from the tank to the hose then on to the rv. 
I ordered this set of mirrors to help me see behind my camper.  They are very easy to use and are very firmly mounted.  IMPORTANT: Go to the manufacturer's website to find the exact model for your truck.  The Amazon site might tell you the wrong model for your truck.  I recommend this product. good cloths. exactly what you'd expect. exactly what the description says. 3 in a pack. all same color. exactly like the picture. if you need them then this is a good deal. The Tender Jr. does not come with a cigarette adapter so I cut this in half to make two. I purchased 2 lighter plugs for a buck each from China&#8230; with free shipping&#8230; and they are working fine. These aren&#8217;t an exact match with the Tender cables but they fit together OK and are easy to determine polarity with the wire colors. You can also just use this as an extension cord for your Tender. The description states a length of 12-inches&#8230; but it&#8217;s actually 14-inches tip-to-tip on the connectors. Nice item for the price and it&#8217;s made in Mexico. 
a must on water pumps, thermostat housings, fuel pump mount to the engine block and on differential covers. also good for a thread sealant. highly satisfied. Be sure to check with the Auto or Truck Manufacturer to find the correct SIZE of Oil Filter for your vehicle. Amazon's Parts Locator says that the Motorcraft  FL820S does not fit my 1995 Mercury Grand Marquis, 4.6 Litre V-8 engine. This is incorrect. The fact is that the Motorcraft FL820S is the FORD-recommended filter for my 1995 Mercury engine, and is recommended in almost every application of the Ford /Mercury/Lincoln 4.6 Litre engine size.The Motorcraft FL820S interchanges with the BOSCH 3410, the FRAM TG2, and the K&N; 2010.The Motorcraft FL820S  has over 50 pleats, high flow rate, silicone anti-drainback valve, and steel end caps.Amazon's current low price ($3.69) is an excellent value for a quality oil filter that's MADE IN USA !!My car is driven in heavy traffic, desert temperatures, mountain driving, and trans-desert trips from Phoenix to L.A.The standard FORD Motorcraft Filters performed just as well as the high-dollar types -- and filtered MUCH better than the K&N;, which has a very high flow rate (for racing), but the low 90% efficiency rating of the K&N; makes it a no-no for extended oil changes. I wouldn't run a K&N; oil filter for more than 3,000 miles -- you'd just be stirring up dirty oil and pumping it through the bearings !! :>(For my American V-8 engine, I have found the best value to be the Motorcraft FL820S Oil Filter and Mobil 1 5-W-20 Extended Life (Synthetic) engine oil. The quality of the oil filter allows for filter changing every 5,000 miles, and the engine oil is changed once-a-year, regardless of miles driven.For maximum oil life, be sure your PCV system is working properly -- Remove and wash out the PCV Valve with Carburetor  Cleaner, and check for collapsed and/or damaged PCV hoses. A leaking PCV system will suck un-filtered dirt right into your engine !!1995 Mercury Grand Marquis RS225 HP 4.6 Litre SOHC V-8Modified Air Box w/ K&N; Air FilterBosch Impeller Fuel PumpBosch 19 Lb.

It is true that sometimes it takes times for oil to lubricate your engine: it could be weak oil pump or restricted flow. It fits my Lexus LS400. After I change oil with this new filter, I hear the ticking sound on the engine head; it could be the filter restrict oil flow and cause the oil not to flow easily. 
A nice charger. Is also smaller than it appears on the picture. So easy to carry and handle.Unfortunately I had to send it back because it just has the standard clamps to charge.There were no &#34;Quick Disconnect Extension&#34; option to easy plug-n-charge a motorcycle.So I bought the &#34;Black & Decker BM3B 6V and 12V Battery Charger / Maintainer&#34;:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051D3MP6/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0 This is the standard connector for all brands of battery maintainer. I use this w/ solar panels to keep tractor,ATV and Pop Up traiter batterries charged. Be sure solar charger has a anti-drain diode on it. I also reccomend Yuasa battery maintainer. This makes it easy to disconnect and go w/o the insecurity of clamps and eliminates misconnects.. bought this to attach to my car battery, and black and decker BM3B 6V & 12V charger. It plugs in nicely, and charges. 
No more "nagging" to close the screen door! You could probably buy a spring at your local hardware store for about the same price, but the pre-determined install tension (distance to drill holes) and where to mount the spring(s) makes it well worth the $7. I followed the instructions for screw hole distance and only needed 1 spring. Both springs may pull the door past the latch at rest (without door swinging closed), but a normal entry/exit the single spring has enough to overcome the latch without slamming the door. The first one I ordered came without the crossbar and screws, that keeps the knives in place. I returned it, free with Prime and asked that it be replaced, as it looked promising. The second one is fine for my motor home, and mounts to the inside of a cabinet door well. I had to use 1 1/4" screws to fit; it comes with two nuts and bolts for use with the tape, and two 1" wood screws, to be used by themselves or with the tape. I used the two sided tape (4 pieces included), placed and tested it for fit and door closure, and then used the screws (I do not want this dropping on anyones feet!).The inside center of my door is inset with a frame around it and the door-frame held the safe away from the inset by about 1/8" so I used slightly longer screws than provided. If you do the same be sure they will not go all of the way through the door. I recommend this knife safe and not dulling the blades by keeping them in a drawer, or using a heavy wooden knife block.  The steel can fit in a drawer. I installed one of these springs at the bottom of the door.  As others have said, 1 seems plenty strong to close the door without making it slam.  If you only hold the door a few inches open, it won't latch.  But if you open it like you are walking out it will close tight and the latch engages.I think installing the second spring will make the door slam too hard.  But its nice having the second spring just in case you need it.I installed it using the existing screw on the outside of the screen door (where the hinge attaches).  I think measured up 9" (as the directions say) and drilled a hole such that the spring fits between the screen door and the outside door when they are both closed.- to be clear - when you are standing outside the camper, with the screen door closed, you see the spring go from the hinge on the screen door to the door frame.The pictures in the directions seemed a little confusing to me.  It looks more like they want you to put the spring on the inside of the door.  But then you have the spring dragging across the frame when you open the door, scratching the frame and probably making a lot of noise.My way of installing it has zero noise (the spring is not rubbing on anything) and it works nicely.Just make sure there is adequate clearance between your outside door and your screen door before installing the spring.I will take a picture if I get a chance and post it.*** UPDATE ***I added a picture with notes.We had the camper out for 5 days and the spring worked great.  Using just 1 spring is enough to close the screen door and it even will pull the combined screen & exterior doors closed.  (not hard enough to latch, but closed).  I think I will leave it as-is and keep the second spring as a backup. 
Works as intended, easy to plug in and charge the motorcycle batteries.I double checked with volt meter at the end of charging and was at proper voltage Nice high amp (current) rating on this. I epoxy it to a 12ah  12 volt gel battery and I can use it as a jumpstarter oremergency power supply for camping or power outages. After a power outage, I connected my refrigerator to this power supply. Sadly, its inverter was unable to support my refrigerator. The Duracell DPP-600HD doesn't have enough momentary  output to handle the initial start-up current spike of a refrigerator's compressor motor. The specifications say it can momentarily provide up to 960 watts. This equates to 8 amps at 120v.  Yet, public benchmark figures for a home refrigerator's start-up current indicate 13 amps for up to 1/2 second. Other appliances that use electric motors such as sump pumps are likely to exhibit the same characteristics. My suggestion is that customers immediately test this product with any device they intend to power during an outage.Some important specifications are missing in the Amazon listing.  One of the key statics is the capacity of the internal battery, which is 28 amp-hours at 12 v.  This equates to 336 watt hours.  Yet, AC output is much lower than this presumably due to inverter losses.  These losses increase with power output.  The following table illustrates this.  The last column is my calculation.load.................watts....hours....watt-hoursCordless telephone.....5........35.0 ...175Portable stereo.........10........22.0 ...220Laptop computer.......20........7.0 ....140Fan.......................100.........1.7....17036" TV...................133........1.2 ....1603/8 drill.................300........0.4 ....115Warm-air fan heater.312........0.4 ....109Blender..................385........0.3 ....109HID Floodlights.......400........0.3.....107Observe that the total energy delivered (watt-hour) drops with power consumption.  Ultimately, the usable energy is significantly less than what is contained within the lead acid battery.For reference, a refrigerator will use about 200 watts of electricity when the compressor is running. Typical consumers will have their refrigerator running about 50% to 60% of the time, which equates to an average of 100-120 watts being consumed continuously.ConsDoesn't handle current spikes associated with certain electric motorsProsBoth AC and DC outputPortableSimple operation 
Does the job for which it was intended. Added to HOT water and dissolved, pour it into the base of the Air-O-Swiss humidifier to clean any 'scaling' and other 'old water' contaminants. Then thoroughly rinse (without dunking the base under water) and do this about every 2 months. I use this filter to fill up my 45 gallon water tank as well as using it inline on the city water connection.  That way I'm assured fresh, clean water if I'm dry-camping or at a FHU campsite!  Sometimes I go the extra distance to fill up a couple of Britta Water Filter bottles and put them in the fridge for cold, fresh water! The water coming our of this filter feels almost as good as a home water softener. It will help prevent sediment buildup in your fresh tank. Run it for a minute or two before the first use to flush the carbon dust. I cant comment on taste as I bring bottled drinking water but I have used the water for cooking with excellent results. 
These can save you time and frustration while camping. If you spring a leak use one of these. I bought these to quiet a pump, but I found it was not needed for that. I had purchased an accumulator tank and it came with a very short connector so I used one of these and have the other for an emergency. It makes sense how it would dampen sound. RV's have little space to work in so one is a handy spare water-connector that is easy to finger tighten. Recommended. We use this professionally in our shop and it's the only anti seize we will use.  If you are using it for personal use, then this container should last you a lifetime because it is very big.  A small amount goes a long way. Bondo in a tube is exactly what you would expect. It's Bondo in a tube. My experience in the past is that it's a one time use product. If you sit it on the shelf after opening it and using it most likely by the time you need it again it'll be hard. I only needed for a couple spots on the car, one where a tree length fell on it, and this product is perfect. Goes on easily, dries hard and is easy to sand. Saves you money from having to buy a large tub.Highly recommended. 
Product shipped quickly. It is as described and will work fine for my vehicle. Do not order the Reese Power ball 72802 as the hitch mount is 3/4" and the draw bar is 1" mount. You'll need a bushing or return it for a larger mount. These trickle chargers are just what the doctor ordered to keep your weekend cruisers charged and ready to roll. My luck being the way it is the battery clamps on my CTS are of a style that made adapting the included ring terminals very challenging. So the fix for my application was to order a lighter adapter and extension harness which is also conveniently available from Amazon. Even with the need for extra accessories I am happy with the product... This O2 sensor was a direct replacement for the original part.  Wire was the correct length and wires/plug matched original perfectly.  Easy install and I have seen a few MPG increase in fuel economy since installation.  The replacement of these sensors will also help ensure longer catalytic converter life.  Very happy with this purchase. 
Used on a 2002 Chevy Silverado 5.3L with 206k miles. NOTE: this is the lower belt, for the AC unit. I changed it while replacing my water pump, along with the fan belt and pulleys. It's running almost as quiet as the day I got it! wet or dry, hot or cold, very, very quiet. This 30W non-detergent oil is what you should use in your 4 cycle lawn mower or garden tractor.I have a garden tractor with a 26 HP Kohler engine and this 48oz is exactily how much the engine uses when you change the oil and filter. I like not having left over new oil. That lets me use the container for the used oil.  Ordering was convenient and shipping was fast. a must on water pumps, thermostat housings, fuel pump mount to the engine block and on differential covers. also good for a thread sealant. highly satisfied. 
I am installing these on a 02 chevy avalanche 1500 5.3L v8. they are a exact replacement of oem. AC Delco all the way... good stuff. I purchased Accutire MS-4350B Setpoint Tire Gauge a few weeks agoto replace my Accutire MS-4021B which batteries went dead.It works fine and to date I have had no problems with it The dealer wanted to charge me $39 for this filter and I bought this and replaced it myself - will buy again - at the lower price 
Sure you can use a C clamp or a adjustable wrench but this isn't very expensive and looks to be of reasonable construction. My only issue is I have everything to install brakes but I've been waiting for almost 3 weeks for a floor jack to ship and I'll be damned if I'm breaking out the jack out of my trunk when quality floor jack is on order. Ok finally used this tool and all I can say is Perfect! Works just as it should, I tightened in small slow increments and let the piston settle all the way back. Made adding the pads a dream, now if there was a way to keep the freak'n pads in place till you slide the caliper back in place ! lol I bought this extra one to hook up to my quad's battery permanently and just have the plug in routed cleanly, so all I have to do is hook it up to my battery tender and I'm all set. I bought this for my viar 85 p with the 12 foot extension so for 14 bucks I have 14 more feet . Just be careful to make sure the wires are not near moving parts or the hot manifolds . Works well . I pump one tire , let it cool a few minutes and do another . Would work with the pump to plug a tire on the side of the road without taking off the car . Just pump up the flat , spray windex to find the leak . Clean it out , plug , and inflate . Then cut off the excess in 15 min if you used glue like you should for a permanent plug . If I ever find the time I hope to mount a female ligher adapter direct off the battery  next to my hitch so I can reach a trailer tire now I need to either unhitch the tow vehicle and move back or take the tire off . I am disabled so it is difficult but I recently bought a impact wrench so I am looking for a good jack as my tow vehicle uses a bumper one not useable for the trailer . The viar 85 p will blow up a 15 inch tire in about 1 min 45 seconds from flat so the wires do not get hot , just let it cool a equal amount before doing the next . If your just topping off it is no problem . Puts in 10 pounds in under a minute . 
This filter worked great on my 2003 Chevy Silverado with a 5.3l even though Amazon says it doesn't!!!  It's a Original Equipment (O.E.) filter, so that's another plus in Quality!!! How to I know for sure of the correct filter.  I have a Alldata.com subscription for my truck.  5 years was like $[...], so a great deal.  I get access to everything I need to know on my truck.  How to do things, Hours it'll take to do a job, O.E. Part Numbers and prices, etc..  So I looked up Fuel Filter, and it told me the O.E. part number for the filter is 25171792 looking that up on Google, I find that Number crosses over to the GF652 Filter.  From this web site, [...]Sure enough it fit just fine.  Though the filter that was on it was a GF-626! Which was the Original on my truck.  I guess there has been a Number change.  Just to make sure once again, I checked directly from ACDelco for a fuel filter for my Truck.  You can check it out here [...]  and then click on Parts Catalog!!  Anyway sure enough it also shows the GF652 fuel filter for my truck!!!It's a filter, what's to say?  ACDelco filters are quality filters.  Can't go wrong with installing another O.E. filter onto your Car/Truck!  Since I changed out the Cooled in my truck for the first time in the 7 years I've had it, the Dex-Cool coolant still looked great.  I drained and changed the coolant with a 50/50 blend coolant, so I wouldn't have to use tap water, or have to buy Distilled Water!!!  This is how you get coolant to last a long time.  Not Contaminating with Tap Water!!!  Anyway, Did Coolant change, Oil change, Oil Filter change, Fuel Filter Change and Air filter change.  I have about 39,000 miles on my truck.  Normal Maintenance type stuff.  It's on it's 3rd AC Compressor, so AC system is Good, New belts when that work was done. I just installed this filter (Fram CH9972) in a 2009 Toyota Highlander 4-cyl.  The filter and the o-rings fit fine.  This filter element looked very similar to the used element I pulled out of the filter housing.  I purchased the filter element from Walmart for ~$6-$7, all local auto parts stores had this filter for $11-$14.  I also purchased from Amazon theK-D Tools 3253 End Cap Oil Filter Wrenchto remove the filter housing.I followed the instructions from a YouTube video "2008 Highlander Oil Change".  The video is for 6-cyl engine, but the process for 4-cyl is very similar, except that you do not have to remove anything to access the filter housing.  The filter housing is just behind the bumper cover.The process is a bit more complicated and messier than replacing a spin-on oil filter, but nothing too difficult to prevent me from doing it again.I gave this filter 4-star rating because there are higher efficiency filters for this application, e.g. Purolator PureOne PL25608, which also seems to have better construction.  Unfortunately, I could not find one for sale locally and it would cost $20+ from AdvancedAutoParts with S&H;, so buying Fram CH9972 made the most sense for me.UPDATE AUG-2010:  Check your local Toyota dealership for this filter cartridge.  My local dealership's price was the lowest anywhere at $5. This is the review I did when these filters were sold in "packs of 2" There are some mistakes which i will highlight in brackets.These filters (PL20195) were bought as a replacement for the Toyota filters that are found on the 2.5L D-4D diesel engine in the Toyota Hilux pickup truck. They are of a very high quality as judged by the sealing gasket, the anti-drain back valve and its weight.Filter is being used with Mobil 1 Delvac 15W-40 (edit: it was actually 5W-40) Fully Synthetic engine oil and the engine noise has certainly reduced from its previous dino based lubricant.In my country, the Toyota dealership(TTTL) charges about US$28 for one filter; purchasing online and having the filters shipped cost me about US$13 for one.I highly recommend this filter as a high quality replacement that doesn't break the bank or if you plan to extend oil drain intervals.Now the technical stuff for people that want to know:PL20195 = PL20064 minus the pressure relief bypass valve (exactly the same dimensions)PL20195 is a longer version of the PL10241PL20064 is a longer version of the PL10028 (edit: the PL10028 doesn't have an antidrainback valve)The larger the filter usually means:1)that it takes longer for the oil pump to fill it.2)that there is more filter medium to trap more contaminants out of your oil3)that the oil will pass through the filter medium slower4)theoretically that a higher RPM will be required to activate the filter bypass valve (which means that you can rev your engine slightly higher without the oil bypassing the filter medium) - this really depends on the PSI that the pressure relief valve was designed with, but if a small filter and a larger filter have the same PSI value for the "relief" then this theory should hold true.Today the filter is currently being used with Shell Rimula R4 15W-40 for 8000Km oil change intervals 
I ordered this to help make a better fit for the bike rack on the front of a Ford Expedition. I was specifically hunting for a fairly short extension because I wanted the bikes to stick out no further than necessary. The selection of holes in this extension allowed me to adjust the fit into the receiver, as well as the fit of the bike rack into the extension. This allowed me to fit the bikes about 2 inches closer to the vehicle than any other extension I was able to find. Very pleased with its performance. Just make sure you measure the distance between the tires as they make 2 different sizes. The larger one would never have fit my trailer. I have found the more stable my trailer, the more comfortable it is. I bought two sets / 4 total. I use them near the middle of the lifting range which puts the saddle about 18 to 19 inches high. This is perfect to get my truck off the ground and give me an inch or so of ground clearance to R&R; the tires and do other work underneath the vehicle.I don't need 6t worth of lift, but I like how these j/s have a wide lifting range. With these set for my range (as stated above), they are not teetering at the top of the range like others I've used in the past, but are comfortably in the middle. They are very stable and solid units.It would be helpful if the info stated the lifting range of the units, not just the tonnage they can support as a pair.Min. Lift Height (in.)14 29/32Max. Lift Height (in.)23 1/2 
Great set of levels make getting level at campground a snap. Graduated markings tell you how many inches you are off.  Good adhesive backing eliminates need to drill holes. This thing has 2 readouts and 4 scales and no instructions on how to read any of htem.  The SWR is easy enough to figure out but the others are anyones guess, came with some little wire antenna that is nowhere in the one sheet instruction that comes with it.  The signal strength meter dosn't seem to register at all.  It was cheap enough and probelly works, but your  have to find an engineer to tell you how to use it. This air deflector makes the air go to the side.  That's all it does.1. There are 2 pieces and no printed instructions - just the box where you can see how to assemble.2.  The 2 pieces fit together by grooves.  Slide and you can adjust by pulling/pushing to get it to fit on vent.3.  Magnets to hold this on vent.  The magnets aren't strong but - barely strong enough to hold on the ceiling.There's nothing good to look at with this deflector.  It kind of disappears since it's transparent plastic.If this will fit your vent, just get one.  See how you like it and you can order more later. 
The pair of levels are a great value.  I recently purchased these for a second time, as the originals were sold with my previous trailer and I wanted to make my new trailer easier to get on a level stance.There really isn't much to go wrong as far as product failure is concerned.  Accuracy is up to you with the initial installation.Recommended method of installation is to get your trailer level/RV, front to back, and side to side.  Once you have your trailer true, install the graduated levels in locations which will show you front to back level (placed on the side of the trailer) and side to side (place on the front or back of the trailer).  Make sure the bubble indicates "level" by being in the center point of the tube.Installation should be done once all your components are "stressed" as they will be for trailer/RV use (I.E. front tongue on a travel trailer, all the normal weight sitting on the winch foot, or in the case of 5th wheels/motorcoaches, landing gear down), try to place the levels on the RV in clear view of the winch/landing gear controls to enable leveling without having to relocate to a different location to view the levels.I accomplished this on a travel trailer by placing one level on the very front center, and the other on the side of the frame tongue close to the winch.  Though small, with sharp eye-sight, you can take advantage of the one on the front of the trailer as you position the trailer to see if you can establish a level side to side stance as you near your desired location.On my 5th wheel, my landing gear controls are on the front corner of the main body.  I placed one on the side of the rig for front to back level, and another right around the corner on the front side (for side to side level) still within sight of the controls, as well as from the truck cab for backing up.  Even though the level is off center, if it is installed properly with the trailer level at the time of installation, it will work fine.As far as the graduated scales are concerned, you will have to find your "scale" for adjustments, as it depends on where the levels are placed in reference to the center of the pivot points.The levels come with a self adhesive foam strip on the back for placement as well as two holes for screws if you wish to drill holes in the side of your rig.  I go with the adhesive strip route, as I don't like unnecessary holes.  The only negative with the adhesive strips is they will flex if stressed and it can put the levels off level, though this only happened to me with the first pair after the foam tape aged a few years.One last comment . . .the green bubble tube will fade from extended UV exposure.  It will not interfere with the accuracy, just makes it a little harder to read.If you are looking for larger levels which can be read from a distance, I know they are out there, but I have no experience with them to make a comparison.  I do not wish to clutter the appearance of the rig with large levels. This seems to be one of the better levelers. There are two different scales on these levels. One is for the side-to-side (back of the coach) and the other is for the front-to-back (side of the coach). The reason there are different scales are they are more-or-less calibrated in inches.For example, it is simple Trigonometry to determine how many inches the coach is out of level simply by using the formula for right-angles and solve for one side. The input values are the angle (determined by the level) and distance from the level to the point at where you want to know how many inches of lift are needed.For the side-to-side level, the 1&#34; markings are pretty accurate as long as you put the scale in the center of the coach, as most coaches are within an inch or two of width from another.  However, for the front-to-back level, even though you put the scale in the center, the result will vary wildly due to the length of the coach. Using this level on a 18ft coach will result in a far different measurement than say a 35ft coach.Also, if you don't put the level in the center (in the side or back), then the two ends of the coach will be different. For example, if the level is in the center, then when the level measures 1&#34; off level, that means 1&#34; on either front or back. But if you put the level off-center, then the level reading 1&#34; might truly be 1/2&#34; on one end, and 1 1/2&#34; on the other. Again, it is simply a principle of Right Angles in Trigonometry.Also, do not rely on the self-adhesive backing as over time it can move. As hard as it may be for you to do, drilling a couple holes and inserting screws into the levels is the best bet. The install is easy, just level your camper using a carpenter level of 3 feet or longer.  Set the level from side-to-side on your smooth flooring or counter top. Then set the level from front-to-back the same way on the smooth flooring or counter top.  Now position the Hopkins 08525 levels, one on the side you prefer to work from at the front of the camper, on a flat vertical surface.  Do the same on a side wall near the front corner on a smooth vertical surface.  Use the double stick tape to position, but consider adding pop rivets or small screws to hold the setting for many years.  Holes are provided in the Hopkins levels.Use the front level first to drive onto leveling ramps or boards, then use the side level along with the tongue jack to finish (after you unhitch). Extend your stabilizer jacks and you're set for level comfortable sleeping in your camper.

Extend your stabilizer jacks and you're set for level comfortable sleeping in your camper. These caps fit on top of the Tri Lynx levelers (Tri Lynx 00015 (10)  Lynx Leveler) or by themselves, for under stabilizer jacks or the hitch jack (if you have a light trailer).  They can also be used on top of the levelers, for under the tire(s) to level your RV.  I don't know how much weight they can bare, but they do well with my 3,400lb trailer for all of the uses described above. I attached these to my travel trailer. This product makes it easy to level both front to rear and side to side. 
I purchased this to be able to attach a high-end hydraulic assisted bike rake on the back of my Jeeps (JKs) with the rear tire still on.  It fit perfectly and teamed with the Bolt Lock BLT7018448 5/8'' Receiver Lock (Keyed specifically for your line of vehicle) it can be kept in the Jeep and my daughter doesn't need anything but her car key.The extender is exactly as advertised, well made, fit perfectly and does eactly what it is inteded for. Bought this with Rancho bracket kitRancho RS5567 Steering Stabilizer Bracket Kitfor my 2002 f150 7700 on 35s. steering is much smoother and the steering wheel doesnt move when hitting bumps. i love it! The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around! 
Save your paint buy the door gards for your jeep the only thing I can say is make sure you clean the door jam first and make sure you have lined up and its easy if read the instruction don't just peel the cover off and try and stick it on you will miss place the guards where you want them then pull on the clear tape and the cove will come off then just push down Rain-X makes terrible wipers, but you don't need them if you put enough of this on.Tip: don't put it on the side windows, unless you want all the rainwater rushing up into your car whenever you crack them open. This stuff works very well,spray on and watch the dirt, break dust just drip down to the ground.Rinse very well and don't allow it to dry.You'll be amazed and what comes off of your wheels amd tires 
This little gadget keeps my lift handle paired up nicely when mounted to my vehicle. It can get in the way when jacking, but it is easily solved by just pulling it up onto the d hook on the top. This product is well made and comes in handy when you want to climb out of your Jeep. It is easy to put on and does its job very well. The size of the grip itself is perfect as your hand can wrap around it, for a good surface to hold onto, instead of grabbing onto the roof. This buffer has plenty of power to get the job done, and appears to be well worth the money.  Some minor assembly is required.  There is a `manual' but it does not contain any instructions, instead it mostly covers general safety.  Assembly is fairly simple.  You first attach the curved top handle, either with or without, the straight side handle.  The handle can be installed for either right or left hand operators.  The buffer is top heavy, so installing the side handle is highly recommended.This unit comes with the accessories to get started right away.  For buffing, it has a wool pad, and rubber backing pad.  For sanding, a Velcro backed hard plastic disc is included, but you will need to provide the sandpaper inserts.  A special wrench for locking down the rubber backing pad is included.Controls are pretty basic.  There is a throttle switch on the bottom of the handle, with a lock button to keep the motor running.  The speed control dial is on the top of the housing, and goes from 1 to 6 (maximum).  The buffer starts to whine at around level 3, and gets screaming loud at full speed, when ear protection is definitely recommended.  The amount of vibration will vary according to the task, and motor speed.  When sanding or buffing fine dust is typically produced, so you may want to wear eye protection and a dust mask.If you are into weightlifting, using the buffer on a vehicle may not be too difficult, but for those not so physically fit, managing the weight and vibration, could be a challenge.  Because of the tool is about 18 inches long, your hands end up positioned about a foot apart, in order to keep the torque generated by the buffer under control.  Just a little inattention can result in losing control, or dropping the buffer, and you don't want to hurt yourself, damage your paint job, dent your vehicle, or damage anything else.The supplied wool buffer is quite thick, and does a pretty good job, but you do need to apply pressure for it to work.  For the average sedan, buffing the hood and trunk should be the easiest.  Things get harder when you do the sides, or curved or irregular surfaces, and have to both support the weight of the buffer, and apply pressure to the surface.  Buffing non-flat areas usually requires changing angles, and varying the point of contact, and amount of pressure applied.  Users will need to find the grip and techniques that work best.  Buffing will require some finesse at times, and if your muscles are straining, this is when accidents can happen, or you can hurt yourself.  Doing the roof can be tricky as well.The listed weight of eight pounds, may not sound like a lot, but if you are bracing your body, locking your forearms, and squeezing hard on the handles for an extended period of time, you may find your muscles a bit sore, or in `shock' from the vibration, if you overdo it.  Just go easy when using it for the first few times.The pictured buffer has a blue plastic housing and black handle, but the unit also comes with an orange plastic housing.  It has a ten foot cord with a twin blade plug, and comes with a set of spare brushes.  The buffer does produce very good results, so if you have a strong back, and the upper body strength, it could be a very cool buy. 
PROS:Indicator light while charging. Shows when charging is complete.AC power cable.Easy to get inexpensive terminal adapters so you can leave them on your vehicle and trickle charge as necessary. This thing is Awsome.  It has all a camper or over the road traveler needs for emergency power and presurized air.  Comes with Battery Cables, Air Pressure Hose and Coinnections, Instruction Booklet (a must read), and several types of power outlets.  You will need an electrical extension cord, which is not included, to charge it up via AC Outlet, or you can charge it up via the 12Volt Auto Lighter Adapter Cord, which is included, but which I would not recomend unless you have no other source of power, because this thing looks like it packs a punch.  I like it and think it's worth the money.  I just started using it so Icannot speak to its durability, bt otherwise it is Awsome.  Recomend. The 3rd generation powerprobe includes a number of changes for additional flexibility.  In short, it is a vehicle powered DVM with both a 20 foot cable and an additional 20 foot extension giving you a 40 foot working range around either the battery terminals or cigarette lighter outlet, both clips and a plug are included in the kit.With the series 3 units they use a hard gold plated banana jack to hold the removable probe or cables to extend your reach.  If you purchase the accessory kit, it includes piercing probes that self center on a conductor, pierce the insulation, and attach to the jack allowing you to tap a wire at any point to locate intermittant problems.While the DVM is backlit all the time, it also has 2 bright white LEDs facing forward to aid in finding and probing terminals in dark places.  The actual probe is hardgold plated with a sharp tip and removable at the banana jack.  Another identical probe is included with a screw-in female banana jack in the accessories kit to retrofit the powerprobe I and II units to accept external cables and probes.If you need to excite a circuit with a connection to battery ground or to battery positive, the switch allows a momentary connection to bridge the probe tip to either voltage which is useful in testing relay driven circuits, indicator lights, and other small current loads.  The prope voltage is always displayed during testing on the meter. The voltage/ground switch is circuit breaker protected in case you accidentally drive 12 volts into a chassis ground.  Additionally, since the switch takes abuse it is easily replaced if it fails with just a screwdriver.Combined with the testlead set, the powerprobe 3 greatly simplifies testing of vehicular wire and big rigs up to a single trailer.  The DVM has 5 selectable modes of operation designed for different problems.  Reading the manual is important to get the full value from this meter.Although the price is a little high, the design and construction quality are excellent.  Enough wire is provided to check running lights on trailers or to look for blown fuses.  All of the wiring is exceptionally flexible and heavily insulated with top quality connectors.  Both the tester and accessories come in hard plastic cases that can be stowed in a service box.Not mentioned in specifications is that although the probe runs from 12-24 VDC, the meter can be used to measure voltages up to 80VDC. 
Consider this...  The combine cost of your tow vehicle and trailer...  The combine weight of your tow vehicle and trailer...  The fact that your trailer may well weigh more than your tow vehicle...  And that moron that just jumped in your lane then slammed on his brakes...  This is NOT the time to think to yourself, "maybe I should've gotten a better brake controller."  Seriously, when the difference in cost is under $100, is it really not worth buying the best?I've used the Tekonsha P3 for two and half years now and I have nothing but praises to sing!  Features, user friendliness, and results!  This unit has it all.  First lets talk about the mechanism.  It uses a digital G-Sensor as apposed to a physical pendulem.  Why is this a benifit?  Because there are no downhill issues that you see with the physical and analog type sensors.  Prior to digial sensors, the downhill slope would throw off the pendulem and the brake controller either would send a weaker current to the brakes or none at all.  Some people have questioned the reliablity of digital sensors.  But with more than 10 years of full production digital units, complaints are actaully less than the older analog units.  Consider this as well, the sensor is not only quicker but more accurate as well, hard to soft braking is much safer now.  How does it work?  Just like any other accelerometor...it senses the volume deceleration and then computes an appropriate voltage and current to send to the trailer brakes based on a percentage of the user's max output setting.Let's talk interface.  A four button face with a roughly 1.5" LCD display plus a belly mounted manual switch.  With no brakes connected, this unit will dispay the default "Tekonsha Screen".  Once brakes are connected via the trailer plug, the unit will display the "Tow Screen".  It has a large two/three read out that displays 0.0 as a default.  While sitting still and once brake pressure is applied it will jump to approximately 10% of the max set output, after 3 seconds of being stationary it will move up to 25% power.  This is designed to "hold" the trailer if stopped on an incline or decline.  Setting the max brake power is a snap with the two "Up" and "Down" buttons on the left side of the face.  The value moves up and down by 0.1 increments and quite quickly if you hold the button down.  The last two buttons are "boost" and "page" which I will discuss when I talk features.  The last button is the manual brake override.  This bottom mounted spring loaded slider switch will manually add braking power to the trailer brakes (up to the user set max) even without depressing the vehicles brake peddle.  This is a standard feature on all brake contorllers, but I wanted anyone looking for their first brake controller to understand what this was.  Lastly, is the warning screen.  It's a deep red screen with a trailer and a "no" sign.  This indicates that the controller which had previously sensed brakes connected no longer can sense them.  Generally an indication of a poor trailer connection at the wiring harness or a problem with the brakes themsleves.Let's talk features.  I've mentioned the "Boost" button, but what is it?  There are 4 levels of boost for trailer brakes.  Off, LV. 1, LV. 2, & LV. 3.  Boost adds a brief (fraction of a second) burst to the trailer brakes which slows the trailer slightly more than the normal pressure would and keeps it from bumping or pushing the tow vehicle when brake pressure is initailly applied.  Very important if as many are these days, your trailer weighs more than your tow vehicle.  After the burst it returns the voltage and current to the G-sensors reccomended output.  There isn't a real scientific method for figuring what you need to use.  The picture on the home screen shows LV1 as small trailer, 2 as a med tailer, and 3 as a large trailer.  My trailer is a 6K lb. TT and I just leave it on the default LV. 1 boost.  Everytime the units is powered it returned to the default LV. 1.  The unit will power down after 15 mins with no trailer connected AND no input from the brake signal wire.  The "Page" button will take you to a second screen that you navigate with the "up", "down", and "Boost" (now "enter") buttons.  This sceen has some cool features as some useful features.  "Backlight" allows you to brighten or dim the brightness of the display.  "Color" lets you set the color of the display.  (Yeah I know, unessesary, but cool)  The default color is "White" which is more of a light blue.  There's also Magenta, Orange, Dk Blue, Violet, Lt. Green, and Dk. Green.  Red is not availible as it's reserved as a warning color for the "no trailer connection" warning screen.  Back to the page screen.  There's also a VERY USEFUL troubleshooting screen.  It lets you view diagnostics on the fly and over the road that can give you four digit readouts of battery voltage, stoplight (brake input signal) voltage, brake voltage, and brake current.  This screen alone is worth the cost of this brake controller!  When you first connect your tailer do some tests and record the max input you set, the output under normal braking conditions, as well as the brake voltage and amperage.  If down the line you get the feeling the brakes aren't working properly, you can re-run this test and see if it's an electrical problem or not.  Finally when your done, pressing the page button will return you to the "tow screen."Installation.  A snap for anyone that has a factory tow package.  Tekonsha offers plug and play wiring harnesses that plug into most make and model years of trucks.  If you have to have it installed or choose to install it yourself as I did, it can be challenging.  But it's a simple four wire hookup.  A 12V input from the battery (running thru a 30A auto reset breaker NOT a fuse), an output to the brake pin of your 6 or 7-way trailer connector, a stoplight input running to your vehicle's stoplight switch behind the brake peddle, and lastly a frame ground.  The mount can be a little challenging to install because of the akward access to the screws, but it can be mounted at nearly any angle other than strait up or down and provided the face is facing a close to directly rearward as possible.All in all, this is probably the most important review I've ever done.  This controller will save you grief and keep you and your vehicle safe.  Make sure for your safety, your families safety, and the safety of all those on the road you buy the brake controller that does it's job the best.  Buy the Tekonsha P3. I have installed a transmission cooler in my FJ Cruiser and use this scan tool/gauge to monitor the transmission temperatures in the pan and at the converter control valve sensor. Having the rig set up for towing, this product is a very valuable asset, plus you can watch various other parameters and sensor reading, MPG`s, etc etc and use it also as a scan tool...Excellent product! I used this controller to replace the horrible factory dodge controller in my 2010 ram 2500. This controller is worlds ahead of the factory controller in terms of features and available settings. If you are hauling a large trailer it is a must have. The boost function is a great feature that applies the trailer brakes ahead of the truck brakes. You can set boost to 3 levels to meet your desired brake feel. My fiver weighs around 2500lbs more than my truck and between this controller and the exhaust brake stopping is effortless. 
Easy to install. I used my own screws because of the material that I was mounting the bracket on. I had to tape one of the light adapter plugs as it was a loose fit in the bracket. I receive the unit with a black power adapter not white color like the picture show. But no big deal!It comes with all mounting screws and 2 stripes of foam double side tapes. I will not use these tapes, these are some cheap foam type. I don't think it will hold for long. I use black 3M heavy duty exterior double side tape for mounting. I did not use screws because I mount the laser unit underneath the garage door opener. for ceiling mount screw is still the best! I use heat gun to warm up the these tape for mounting, it works like a glue!This unit comes with a mounting bracket, first you have to mount the bracket than hook the laser unit onto the bracket. however the laser unit is not secure on the bracket. It can come loose very easy! which mean it can fall onto your car. So, I add an electric tape at the back of the unit, now the unit stays!The red laser is bright and clear, it can be see clearly in day light. the laser will turns on and stay on about 2 to 3 minutes.9V battery for power outage backup is also a great feature!Great buy! Great wheel lock that is easy to activate and unlock.  It comes with 3 keys, one of which has a LED light on it.  The product also comes with a reminder cord that attaches to the handle bar as a reminder.  It does just what I was looking for. 
It does what it is supposed to do, that is to increase placement distance from the car to the electrical outlet It does exactly what it's supposed to do. No problems whatsoever. This product will do what is says it will do.  That being said, it does not inspire confidence in heavy use situations.  It does not appear very rugged.  Nice that it comes with the mount, but again the mount is very thin and light and probably won't last very long.  Also, the wire coloring does not match with the standard US codes.  White is ground on the item, while in most cases in the US, black is the ground wire.  Where was this thing made?  Again, it is a good price, and a useful product, but just beware it might be very rugged or reliable.  Make sure to read the enclosed documentation so that you match your wiring correctly. 
I required an ammonia-free window cleaner for my tinted windows. This does the job quite nicely. It isn't how well it does, rather how safely it does it. I use this in combination with the microfiber glass towels -Viking Diamond Weave Microfiber Windshield & Glass Cloth - 2 Packand I was really shocked at how well this works! It really does make a difference over regular glass cleaner. Gives you a streak-free clean that somehow really does look cleaner than the "other" glass cleaners. Does what it says it does......looks great ! 
I bought this gage, because it's easy to use. Wife friendly, and it's sealed. No dirt will get into the gage. You can nail your presure real easy. Thats why I bought one for myself.  SW I love these microfiber cloth! I use them to clean everything! Mostly for my cars! They do not leave scratches on your car and can be use for almost anything! have not put the chock's to use yet, but I know they will do the job for me. I have other chock's but I like these better. 
It's great if you keep your car clean! it's non-greasy and doesn't have that harsh cleaning solution smell.  it has a very simple clean smell that fades shortly after, and it does clean the surface. This is a leather spray that does help keep the leather soft and looking nice. It is NOT a heavy duty cleaner thus if your leather is in really poor condition like one of my chair covers, this spray will not do the job. This works well on my auto seats and does give a good shine and soft feeling. I like the product. It is easily applied. Do not apply if the leather is really hot after sitting in the driveway as it gets sticky. I should have known better. Maguiar's consistently makes a wonderful product. This does exactly what it is supposed to do. This is not concourse wax - this is a CLEANER wax and it does just that. I found it to be perfect for my project. Fast delivery too.

I have used it on my leather coat, car seats and shoes. Does a fantastic job of softening and conditioning the leather. Even protects my leather shoes from salt damage here in the midwest, where sidewalk and street salt can really ruin a pair of leather shoes in no time. Would recommend to anyone. does the job. 
I bought this based on the reviews. Though it seems to condition the leather, it didn't really seem to buff up the finish and restore my leather to its' original, or near new condition. After cleaning all the floors in my home, and all of my car's leather interior, I followed the directions on the package for conditioning and protecting the leather seats in my car.  While it does make the leather more supple and soft, it doesn't buff up to a shine, or even satin finish, Instead, it seems to leave a dull, chalky finish. I use Lexol leather conditioner on the leather seats in the car and leather furniture. Makes the leather very soft and pliable. I just got one for my 2001 Chevy Suburban and one for my 2006 Ford Five hundred. These covers fit well. They don't slide and they are made of real leather. You can smell the leather scent. One imprtant note is that as a result of these covers being made well and of a thick leather, they do make the driving experience slightly different. They do make the steering wheel thicker. No regrets, the steering wheels on my cars were in poor condition. The alternative would have been to purchace new steering wheels. 
The Zymol Leather Cleaner does an EXCELLENT job of:-CLEANING: The cleaning action is clearly visible: the more vigor you put into working the leather, the more the application of the Zymol Leather Cleaner turns white and sudsy. Follow through the cleaning by wiping off with a clean dry rag and any dirt and grime picked up by the Zymol Leather Cleaner will transfer onto the rag.RESTORING: The end result: the Zymol Leather Cleaner leaves the leather with a polished look as pristine as when the leather was brand new. Mind you, it doesn't accomplish this not by leaving a greasy residue behind like some "cleaners" do. The Zymol Leather Cleaner not only leaves leather feeling clean with NO greasy residue, it restores the softness and suppleness of leather.The cleaning does clearly strip some of the natural oils from the leather. I would strongly advise you to follow through the cleaning with the Zymol Z-509 Leather Conditioner. Both the Z-509 Leather Conditioner and the Zymol Leather Cleaner are available here at Amazon as a package at a very reasonable price.I'm giving the Zymol Leather Cleaner my highest recommendation. Go on, give the Zymol Leather Cleaner a whirl and see for yourself what a FANTASTIC job it does of cleaning your leather! I use Lexol leather conditioner on the leather seats in the car and leather furniture. Makes the leather very soft and pliable. I own a lot of leather items from car seats to leather couches.  This product is great for both Batick type leather (laquered corrected grain) and semi aniline drum dyed leather.  The cleaner easily removes color transfer caused by blue jeans on your quality leather product.  Just be careful to rub only gently and take your time.  The conditioner is good, but I prefer &#34;Leather CPR&#34; to keep my leather items soft and pliable - also available at Amazon. 
This does not only protect, but cleans stains, road film etc. off the paint and bring its to nice clean shine. My cars have ranged from light colours (white and silver) to darker colours (red and blue) and this works perfectly to clean and protect. Sometimes, depending on how dirty the paint was,  2 applications would be done to restore the finish. Safe on clear coats and glass this is perfect. Also, one heavy shower does not remove the wax. Give it a try. This thing fits those bright orange &#34;Homer Buckets&#34; from Home Depot like a glove. When washing down cars with a massive amount of dirt and grime I will rub the wash mitt against the guard to remove the big debris. For those of you who are obsessed with their cars, it is a nice little device. First off, don't get turned off by the name, Yellow is the color of the stuff, it won't turn your paint yellow!  It does look great on yellow paint though, also reds and darker colors like dark blue and black.  For lighter colors you are better off going with something else, Collinite 845 is a great choice.Pros:-DRIPPY wet looks.  You'll want to grab a towel and dry your paint, its that wet!-Decent durability, approx 2-3 months on a car parked outdoors-Fills in minor swirling-Leaves paint nice and slickCons:-Stains trim (rubber, black plastic)-Needs to be applied very thin, otherwise it can be hard to take off-Can streak if used on a hot surface or if too much is usedOverall, this is a great wax that has been around for a very long time because it looks so great.  its a total steal at the price.

Even protects my leather shoes from salt damage here in the midwest, where sidewalk and street salt can really ruin a pair of leather shoes in no time. Would recommend to anyone. I got these to use on my leather clothes and car seat. Very cheaply made. The white lint from the pad comes off and is a mess to pick up from leather clothes and car seat. Go to dollar store and get microfiber cloth !

This turns out to be one of the best products for cleaning leather I have come across.  We use it for our automobile interiors and it cleans the leather without streaks or residue.  I haven't tried it on my home furniture, as I typically use Lexol for semi-aniline dyed leather furniture. 
This is a leather spray that does help keep the leather soft and looking nice. It is NOT a heavy duty cleaner thus if your leather is in really poor condition like one of my chair covers, this spray will not do the job. This works well on my auto seats and does give a good shine and soft feeling. I like the product. It is easily applied. Do not apply if the leather is really hot after sitting in the driveway as it gets sticky. I should have known better. works well Works great on my 2012 Wrangler Sport. Heavy duty rubber that fits well in my hitch receiver and looks like it will last awhile. 
I love these microfiber cloth! I use them to clean everything! Mostly for my cars! They do not leave scratches on your car and can be use for almost anything! I haven't used them yet but they look good and it will do what I need. I need to wash my car I guess I bought this as an extension for a tire-inflater and car vacuum where both plug into the 12V cigarette light socket.  With this, I can take the inflater and vacuum all around the vehicle with no worries.  I can even stretch it out and manage to use it for those items on another vehicle that's parked beside mine.  So, I'm please with it. 
This stuff is good for cleaning and leaving a nice long lasting shine especially on dark vehicles ex: black, dark grey, red etc. Some reviews are correct is saying it doesn't hold suds, but you must understand that this product contains conditioners which will do that. Its best to use a bottle attached sprayer "on hose" with solution in it. This will make suds, suds, but want last as again it has conditioners in it. Product smells like hair shampoo, gold color doesn't make paint change in appearance either, some products after long use stays attached because of wax buildup can make your vehicle appear to look the color of stuff you are using. Good stuff, way better than Mothers. If it doesn't clean like you need then go get a bottle of blue dawn detergent. The Zymol Leather Cleaner does an EXCELLENT job of:-CLEANING: The cleaning action is clearly visible: the more vigor you put into working the leather, the more the application of the Zymol Leather Cleaner turns white and sudsy. Follow through the cleaning by wiping off with a clean dry rag and any dirt and grime picked up by the Zymol Leather Cleaner will transfer onto the rag.RESTORING: The end result: the Zymol Leather Cleaner leaves the leather with a polished look as pristine as when the leather was brand new. Mind you, it doesn't accomplish this not by leaving a greasy residue behind like some "cleaners" do. The Zymol Leather Cleaner not only leaves leather feeling clean with NO greasy residue, it restores the softness and suppleness of leather.The cleaning does clearly strip some of the natural oils from the leather. I would strongly advise you to follow through the cleaning with the Zymol Z-509 Leather Conditioner. Both the Z-509 Leather Conditioner and the Zymol Leather Cleaner are available here at Amazon as a package at a very reasonable price.I'm giving the Zymol Leather Cleaner my highest recommendation. Go on, give the Zymol Leather Cleaner a whirl and see for yourself what a FANTASTIC job it does of cleaning your leather! Works great and has a pleasant citrus smell. But man does the mist burn your eyes. Made my interior look new and dried to a natural low shine. Did not attract dust or stay wet like other products. I will be buying more of this.

Even protects my leather shoes from salt damage here in the midwest, where sidewalk and street salt can really ruin a pair of leather shoes in no time. Would recommend to anyone. I own a lot of leather items from car seats to leather couches.  This product is great for both Batick type leather (laquered corrected grain) and semi aniline drum dyed leather.  The cleaner easily removes color transfer caused by blue jeans on your quality leather product.  Just be careful to rub only gently and take your time.  The conditioner is good, but I prefer &#34;Leather CPR&#34; to keep my leather items soft and pliable - also available at Amazon. 
These work just fine and provide a good smooth surafce for jacks or landing gear. Since mine are new I can't comment on durability. They fit perfectly with other Links products. Camco makes good items and this is no exception.  A durable and well fitting cap.  I would buy one again if I needed it (had to type at least 5 more words for my review, butt hey are true). I ordered this set of mirrors to help me see behind my camper.  They are very easy to use and are very firmly mounted.  IMPORTANT: Go to the manufacturer's website to find the exact model for your truck.  The Amazon site might tell you the wrong model for your truck.  I recommend this product.

Go on, give the Zymol Leather Cleaner a whirl and see for yourself what a FANTASTIC job it does of cleaning your leather! This wax leaves a nice shine. Compared to the Meguiars Nxt. Gen Tech wax 2.0, they are identical as I have both.This leaves a white residue when dried so you can tell when it's ready to buff off. Used this to clean the vinyl in the interior of a 2011 Corvette that was supposed to be charcoal but had developed a chalky white nasty residue since delivered new from Bowling Green. This cleaner, sprayed on to a microfiber towel, removed all of it very easily and the best part is that it left no residue on the vinyl. It is alcohol based so don't spray it all over the place inside the car, spray on towel then clean. I then applied a coat of Meguiars Protectant Natural Shine with a sponge and wiped excess and the color is now a low luster (no gloss) charcoal that is beautiful as it was intended.

First, as with all of the Dupli-Color Metalcast paints, if you want the metalcast effect, you'll have to use the Dupli-Color Metalcast Ground Coat (MC100) on the surface before you apply the color or it will not come out right. The can says that it also comes out the same if you're painting directly onto chrome like surface but I have not tried this so I don't know. Now for this green. I'm more of a blue and purple guy for dark colors so only by my personal preference do I say that this green comes out just a tad light in color for me. Overall though, if you use the ground coat this comes out great with a nice metal sheen. I recommend this product. I got these for my brand new car since you do not really need to polish a new car. They work great. They pure Carnauba with no garbage added so you can rub them on any surface of your car and they do not leave a white film on, which is a huge bonus. They do give a nice shine and you really feel the protection they provide. I strongly recommend this WAX.

I will keep this simple. If you want to have a "Wet Look" paint finish, this can help you achieve that.  This is how I got my 3 year old car looking like a show car.1. Wash you car with Meguiars Car Wash.  Make sure to get all the dirt off.  Dry thoroughly.  I use a super absorbent chamois to speed up the process.  Make sure to do this in the shade.  The car's surface should be cool to the touch.2. Use the Meguiars Claybar. Keep going until your hand glides on top of the paint.  This will give your paint a glass smooth finish.3. Apply Meguiars Paint Cleaner with a Random Orbital Buffer or Meguiars Buffer.  This will remove any stains and very fine swirls.4. Apply this Mirror Glaze with the Random Orbital buffer.  Wipe off and buff using a Microfiber Cloth.5. Apply your choice of Meguiars Waxes with the Orbital buffer.  I personally prefer the Meguiars NXT wax because I dont have to wait long after applying the wax before I can wipe off and buff.6.  Maintain this new finish by using the Mequiars Ultimate Quick Detailer often to clean any dust,tree sap or bird droppings that may land on your car. The Detailer will keep it lookng great and also extend the UV protection.You just need to do this entire process once or twice a year.  Regularly, you just need to wash your car at least once a week.  And you can re-apply Meguiars wax once a month or as often as you like as their waxes do not damage your clear coat.  That is why I only use their products. You know those expensive "headlight restoration" kits you can get?  Well, you can actually use an abrasive polish (like this one) and achieve much the same result.  I use masking tape around the edges of my headlights, then use an orbital polisher with a firm pad to polish my headlights using this compound.  It's very adept at removing that thin layer of yellowish oxidation which makes headlights more opaque than clear.  Best of all, this bottle has a lot of compound in it and you could polish your headlights probably 75 times on one bottle before running out.So there is that... but it's also good on paint.Over the years I have found the best use of a rubbing compound is to either restore heavily oxidized finishes (with no clearcoat), or to remove paint/scuff deposits on a small area of your car.Be advised that this is a very abrasive compound and you should NOT use this as a general purpose polish for a newer car finish.  Every time you use this product you remove a tiny layer from your car's finish.  Remember that and use with caution.  If someone bumps into your new car in the parking lot and left a paint scuff, this is the ideal product to get it off with.  If you have an old car that's been sitting out in the sun too long and has faded a bit, you can use this product on the entire car to bring it back to its near-original shine by removing that layer of oxidation which makes it look dull.So whether you own a new car or old one, this is a great product to keep in the garage for detailing days. I have had no problems with the functional use of this connector.  I can quickly and easily switch antennas on my car without the use of tools.I had this on my Wrangler for month (January in Colorado - road salt and all) and noticed when I took the antenna off for the car wash that rust had started to form on the base stud.  Since this device provides an important electrical contact, you can't just spray it down with WD-40.  I ended up using a no-residue rust inhibitor called Safari Charlie Gun Lube.  This is a fantastic product with a residue free solvent that removes rust handily. I don't know the details, but they claim it leaves an electrostatic charge at the surface of the material it protects. I applied it to the stud and the removable top part and the rust has yet to return. I also verified that SWR has not been affected.  If you can't find Safari Charlie, I'd recommend trying an electrical contact cleaner or conductive contact grease like what is used on trailer harness connectors.  Any auto parts store should have those. 
Not to remove scratches, but to conceal and and make look presentable. It works well and does what it is supposed to do. Great for light scratches. Harder to use on black cars, but with a little patience it works well. These party light holders do the job but the eyelets will rust and leave a stain on your awning tube. I like the rubber holders better. The micro fiber really grips a lot of dirt.The mitt works very well and does a a great  job in hand washing your car.Better than cotton towel. But not sure how durable will these be ?Used a few times and seems to be holding up pretty good. 
I bought this product to get at stubborn brake springs. It works very well as long as you use it correctly. The one I received is not the black one in the picture. The one that I got is a red handle, but they both do the same job.I recommend this tool! I have had no problems using these and they work as described.  I do not like, though, that you have to hammer in the retaining tab to prevent the platform arms from coming out.  I also do not see how these are really double locking.  I wish they came with a adapter for the saddle since the saddle area is pretty big, but I knew that these weren't completely flat saddles (I made an adapter).  I would recommend them, but know what you are getting before you pull the trigger on getting them. Great little add on that works very well, definitely a add on I am glad I purchased and I would recommend this because it works with ease, does not take up space in the tool box, and is well made...I mean its Lisle, says it all.

This is designed to work with the Valterra bayonet fitting on your Gray or Black water dump valve and it does just that... It does what it is supposed to and suds up. Mount this cup holder anyplace.  Prevent spills and keep drinks handy.  Also, the fold down tray catches condensation to prevent water from damaging surfaces.  When not in use, it folds up and out of the way.  Made to mount to a vertical surface like a wall. 
product description is a little off - actual ingredients are: Mineral Oil, Petroleum Distillates, Calcium Oxide, Aluminum, Graphite.I was expecting a new twist on the standard copper anti-seize compound, just suprised there is no copper at all in it. still does a great job, so no real complaints. People need to understand about motor oil to make the decision on what is right for them including if Royal Purple is what they should use or not.  Forget the marketing, and anything else that suggests this or any oil will do anything "spectacular".  What it can do is what a good motor oil can do, lubricate and help protect an engine from wear (when combined with a good filter). The synthetic oils benefits occur most when an engine is subjected to the extremes, high RPM, high stress, high/low temp situations where it will remain effective better than a conventional oil. Synthetic oils may also maintain their original properties a while longer than conventional oils.  That is it however. That is very important stuff, what motor oil is for. That is good enough, all that should be expected. But it is still motor oil. Any claims of this or any other oil making your car go faster or get better MPG or anything like that should not be believed. That is not the job of motor oil.The definition of "synthetic oil" in this Country is vague and most oils labeled "fully synthetic" are not made from 100% synthetic base stocks. To find out more about how this works look up Mobil Vs Castrol, this was the lawsuit in this country that allowed oils that originated from dino oil to legally be called "fully synthetic".  This does not mean they are bad oils, just that the use of the work synthetic can be misleading.One would need to look to see what base stocks are used to see just how fully synthetic an oil truly is. The base stocks in motor oil are Group I,II,III,IV and V base stocks. Group I-III (1-3) are all conventional mineral oils that have come from the ground. Dino oil. Only Group IV and V use synthetic base stocks (P.A.O. for group IV) and (Esters for group V).95% of oils labeled "fully synthetic" actually begin with group III base stocks which are then highly processed in to the final product.This does not mean that an oil is bad because it is not a true "fully synthetic" oil using 100% group IV or V base stocks or better just because it does use them, but this is something I think is misleading and not understood by most. Though being a true group IV oil using those P.A.O. base stocks is considered better by many. It is an indication of a high quality oil, and certainly meets the definition of a true fully synthetic oil, just not the only consideration.There is much more to an oil than just the base stocks used. The formulations are very complex including many additives with detergent and anti-wear properties along with several others. Many factors go in to making a top quality motor oil.I would not suggest one think they can go incredibly long times between oil changes just because they are using a high quality oil or because a certain mileage figure is on the label. When used with a good filter one may be able to go longer between changes with a good oil, but to protect your engine better you also need to keep clean and fresh enough oil of any type in it. This oil is no exception. Your oil may be capable of outlasting your filter. Some find that changing filters more often than their oil helps extend change intervals. Also there is more to consider when determining oil change intervals than just mileage. Engine type (does it have a turbo for example), environmental extremes etc. also need to be considered. And time is a consideration too because while the oil itself may not be "worn out" or the additive package in it may still be effective (particularly in Extended Performance versions which contain larger amounts) still there are contaminants that oil filters do not remove which are a result of the combustion process, over time these build up and can only be removed by changing your oil. This is also why if you use a vehicle seasonally such as storing your motorcycle over the winter it is best to change the oil when you put it away rather than at the start of the season.If you look on the bottles of oils with claims they can go for long periods of time between oil changes (15K plus) you will find some small print saying things such as "Do not alter oil change intervals from manufacturer requirements on vehicles under warranty (as this will likely VOID your warranty not keeping the maintenance schedule)" and "25,000 miles OR ONE YEAR" as well as many other various conditional statements about the vehicle operating conditions. What may be OK under ideal and perfect conditions is different from most all real situations.Some people engage in oil testing, sending their oil to labs to find out condition of the oil.  For me this seems perhaps reasonable if one it attempting to find out what length change interval they are able to obtain with a certain oil/filter combination.  However as something done on a regular basis for the average consumer this costs as much as an oil change so I would just change the oil instead of finding out the condition the old oil is in.As to Royal Purple being a good synthetic oil? I would say yes it is. Also very expensive particularly with this deal. If it is either the best or worth the price is the larger questions to consider. Is it worth it at this price? I would say NO it was recently on sale for 6.99/quart, at that time or the next time it goes on sale that is the prime time to purchase. Personally I prefer other brands, though my decisions are changing along with the changing of formulations of the oils I use. One should do research in to various synthetic motor oils and consider those as well and decide which one to use. Do not go by marketing claims. There are independent tests and discussions, there is even one with over 1000 posts on this subject on Amazon right now. Many other outside oil forums as well. One can also have their oil tested to compare results vs other brands used at various intervals in their own vehicle if one wants to do that sort of personal research which will yield at least some results.  Also formulations are constantly changing so what ingredients used in any particular oil one year may not be what the formulation is today or will be tomorrow. If you research oil and decide that it is worth paying a bit more for a true group IV oil, then that is a reasonable decision to pay a bit more for that oil. I believe this RP is among Group IV oils, meaning it uses 100% synthetic base stocks.  But contact Royal Purple to confirm this because their formulations change like all others. Make sure you know what you are buying.I would also encourage purchasing any oil when it is on a big sale or has a rebate etc.. I believe most synthetics are overpriced and should be purchased only when on sale as this does happen on a regular basis. Check Amazon and other auto supply stores. There are constantly sales on synthetic oils and/or rebates making the cost per quart 6.00 or less on a regular basis, this is the time to purchase your oil.  Often there are packages with filters which can be good deals as long as the filter is the one you would like to use also.  This nor any other oil will perform well without also using a high quality filter, period. Make sure you are also using a high quality filter. The two need to both be of good quality for best performance and protection.I give this a 4 star rating due to price. It has been on sale for less recently and that is the time to purchase expensive oils. Plan ahead and buy your oil when on a really good sale. You can save about 50% or at least close to it often times especially when offered with packages including an oil filter (as long as it is a good filter). The star rating reflects the value of this deal at this price.In the end get a high quality oil but remember no oil is going to be providing its full benefits if it is no longer effective due to excessive use or age.  Keep your maintenance schedules up to get the best performance and longest life out of your vehicle.Royal Purple IS one in the group of top quality motor oils, just where it ranks is much more difficult to determine.  Disregard outrageous claims made by any manufacturer or person and do your own research in to various synthetic oils to make a decision on which to use.  There are several very good quality brands. Also learn about API, ILSAC and Dexos1 specifications mean. This Royal Purple DOES meet the most current API specification (SF) the ILSAC GF-5 and GM's new Dexos1 requirements. It should be compared against other synthetics that also meet those same specifications. THOSE ARE IMPORTANT RATINGS. These are your best street car motor oils. So YES this is a good oil, NO it will not do anything other high quality synthetic oils in the same class can do, and No this is not the best price I have seen for this oil.Instead of comparing claims on a bottle (other than those API, ILSAC and perhaps Dexos1 ratings) do some outside research. Ignore outrageous claims and make an informed decision based upon knowledge of the oil and filters you purchase and what an appropriate price to purchase them at is.EDIT: Note that at the time of the review Royal Purple was using PAO base stocks.  I have information that it is not not a 100% PAO oil. This has been a pattern among oils that were once 100% PAO group IV oils so you can not count on any brand maintaining their formulations or advising or a new formulation or change.  There are some advantages to a PAO oil such as no need for V.I. additives and if you believe in the value of P.A.O. base stock oils that could justify a slightly higher purchase price.  My belief in this change is a response to this question by a representative or Royal Purple.  This does not mean it is no longer a good oil to buy just that the formulation may no longer use P.A.O. base stocks.  One should know what they are paying for particularly if they are purchasing a product at a premium price especially if that product no longer uses the ingredients one things it does. Simply put, most performance car manufacturers use this oil straight from the factory and that is for good reason, it has the best makeup, and best oil analysis results of any oil that is currently on the market.  Now you could go to any forum and ask questions about oil and you are going to get 100 responses, each recommending a different oil, each with their own reason why their choice is the best.  Honestly, the best thing you can do for your engine is to run a particular oil, and do an oil analysis to see the wear and viscosity numbers.  In my engine, this oil provided the lowest number of wear metals, and the most stable number for viscosity.  Pair that up with great protection at hotter temperatures (which is something that I need for my RX8's rotary engine), and also fantastic cold flow for the winter, and you have an all-year oil that performs just as well as it protects.  Give this oil a shot, get some oil analysis done (Blackstone Labs), and see for yourself! 
Seems to be a good product but does not remove all the odors associated with the water. It wasn't advertised to take out all the odor,just greatly reduce them.  We had some odors from water in a local campground. No taste issues so I think that was o.k and the odor wasn't all that bad but don't think it will take out all odors competely. Product does a good job sudsing as any good car wash detergent should.  Bonus, has a pleasant smell to it.  Would recommend it to any car enthusiast. Works as expected. Fit without any issues. Quality seemed good and have not had any issues with air pressure or smells. 
Low price, can get one for each of my 3 vehicles...the stock wrench that came with the cars are too short....when you need it, it will be worth it. When looking at these products, simply calculate the actual cost per square foot. for example this"speaker kit" contains 1.38 square feet, for around 22 bucks(price fluxuates like its a stock or something?)can u think of anything thats worth 15 dollars a square foot? there are so many cheaper alternatives. dynamat is an awsome product, and it does work. but for those of us not made of money, search this "butyl flashing tape" u will be glad u did. Aligator clips make the battery tender MUCH more versatile.Not many batteries are able to accomodate the "2 pin plug"& this is quite dissapointing when it arrives,and it is not ready to use w/o clips.Actually Battery Tender should INCLUDE,or at least make the buyer aware that these clips are most often a must.It would be advisable for them to include this assembly,even if the price goes up  5 dollars,it is well worth getting the full compliment of accessories to get a completely functional unit. Saves time and shipping.Amazon does list these as a"most often purchased with"accessory,but it is quite essential&most people are unaware of this.On the plus side,it is a a great product,once you can use it! 
This is one of my favorite wheel cleaners. It cuts the brake dust and dirt with ease without damaging your wheels. Works well on any finish like including alloy, chrome and even black wheels.  All wheel cleaners are not created equal. This cleaner will clean very gentle so no damage occurs. Good quality R.V. water heater drain valve. Brass construction with a steel finger tip handle built in. A vital component when winterizing or just performing general maintenance. Teflon tape will seal threads upon install. Great replacement for older leaking or rusty valves. Great product for someone looking for an easy on easy off wheel cleaner that isn't really acidy. I use on chrome wheels as well as polished wheels, no damage to either!! Don't use in direct sunlight though it will damage wheels!! Cleaners tires great as well!! 
I am reading lots of bad reviews on these pigtails.  What worries me the most is some seem to be shipping with a different thread type and people are stripping them trying to make them work.  Why the heck can't these be standardized?  I've also read that some come with different sizes of NPT as well as different thread types.  It seems that what is listed is not always what you order, and on top of that, someone like me, who does not know how to recognize the different thread types and sizes won't even know if I received the correct part or the wrong part.I recommend you double check your part number on the hose before installing them to avoid stripping your regulator.I thought, why not use quick connect hoses to connect my regulator to my appliance.  It seems these mate up nice to other quick connects--but only if made by CAMCO, and then these quick connect fittings don't mate up easily to the other parts like regulators etc.  WTF?  I need still another adapter?  And some people tell me perhaps multiple adapters to make it all work?  I'm not going to use three different adapters to mate up a quick connect.  That means I have a huge lunking thing sticking out ready to be damaged, knocked out of place, that is sure to leak out all my expensive propane.Ok, so I called CAMCO.  I wanted to be sure I ordered the right part and spoke to two different people at CAMCO that blew me off.  It seems Camco parts don't necessarily fit each other.  And they don't sell adapters to make them fit. It would be great if they could provide some customer support and perhaps make up some custom hoses to help people make things work.I give this a 1 star because CAMCO's huge fail in helping me put together a system that will allow me to hook up external tanks to my RV.One star also, because they ship different types of hose fittings and buyers don't know what they are getting.Honestly, I'd like to order one of every one of their parts and analyze them.  I'm an engineer, and if I can't figure out what to order, based on conflicting information--reviews that report receiving different size fittings 1/4&#34; npt than specified 3/8&#34; npt, and a multitude of part numbers--and a need for adapters when a buyer should be able to buy everything he or she needs without an adapter---it all tells me CAMCO has not thought out how their products are used.Think about it, there are only so many way propane tanks, hoses and appliances are hooked up. I don't see any need for adapter other than those that attach to the tanks. Before purchasing this item I called the manufacturer to be sure it did what I wanted.  They said it would but it did not.  i called them back and they said it was capable of what I wanted but I would have to program it for it to work.  Not what you read on the package, not what the manufacturer said, and directions so poor I could not beging to program it and I'm a geek. IT WORKSI NEEDED ONEIT WAS CHEAPIT DID THE JOBI MAY NEVER NEED IT AGAIN AS I MYSELF DON'T FORCE DOUBLE THREADED THINGS BUT OTHERS ARE APPARENTLY NOT SO INTELLIGENT.$400 STIHL CONCRETE SAW IS BACK ON THE JOBI WIN ANOTHER ONE.I WILL PROBABLY LOOSE IT DUE TO PREDATION ETC BEFORE I NEED IT AGAIN BUT UNTIL THEN I CAN CORRECT ANY CARELESS PLUG SCREWING THAT MAY COME MY WAY. 
got it for a car battery to get rid of surface corrosion; cleaned terminals with baking soda and applied the spray...so far so good. Used this to clean the vinyl in the interior of a 2011 Corvette that was supposed to be charcoal but had developed a chalky white nasty residue since delivered new from Bowling Green. This cleaner, sprayed on to a microfiber towel, removed all of it very easily and the best part is that it left no residue on the vinyl. It is alcohol based so don't spray it all over the place inside the car, spray on towel then clean. I then applied a coat of Meguiars Protectant Natural Shine with a sponge and wiped excess and the color is now a low luster (no gloss) charcoal that is beautiful as it was intended. The power cleaner cleans well and sprays well, and the oil sprays nice and evenly. I just washed my filter in the sink...probably shouldn't have, but I did. 
Love K&N wrench off filters.  My GM 5.3L V8 has a hard to reach oil filter.  On the first oil change on this truck I had to remove the nipple which attached the oil filter to the engine block in order to remove the old oil filter which became stuck to the engine block and was destroyed in an attempt to remove it.  K&N are just so simple to remove.  I only use K&N oil filters because of similar problems with other cars. This item is primarily used for REMOVAL, not installation of an oil filter that has been tightened too much to remove by hand. The half-circles of metal grip the canister of the oil filter and they dig into that sheet metal to prevent slipping when you apply pressure to your wrench handle and start to turn. The tool may need to dig in enough to dent the oil filter canister depending on the degree of excessive tightening by a previous installer. Each half circle on the tool is brought to initial grip and held there by a set of springs on a sliding mount to accommodate a variety of filter canister sizes.  I used it to remove the original factory oil filter for the first oil change on a new vehicle. I probably won't have to use it ever again. In 40 years of DIY oil changes across a couple dozen different cars, I've never had a leak by simply hand-tightening the canister to the mount. This is one the best oil filters on the market for the Harley-Davidson Motorcycles. I use these filters on my 2007 Harley-Davidson Fatboy Motorcycle because they do a great job in filtering my oil. The oil filter on my Harley is mounted on the front of the engine. This location plus the fact the crank position sensor is in the way of using most oil filter wrenches, you have to buy a special wrench, which will slip in use, to remove the oil filter . This oil filter has a 17mm nut welded on end of the filter housing, this makes installing or removing the oil filter very easy. You don't have to worry about damaging your Engine Crank Position Sensor which are expensive to replace. I highly recommend this great K&N Performance Oil Filter for any Harley-Davidson Motorcycle owner who uses regular or synthetic motor oil. Great price and it's chrome plated to boot. 
This scratch remover seems to be more of a polish  and lube that will remove the surface scratches for the paint. It does not appear to have any &#34;grinding&#34; type ingredients in the paste.It will have little of no impact on deep scratches or deep nicks in the paint. It is easy to out on and remove and will a decent job for those light scratches. It did not remove any discoloring on my paint such as a stain left by a bird dropping. It ddi make the blemish lighter though. This product was used on a silver car with paint in good to very good condition (some swirl marks, no chips or sun damage).It did cause the paint to shine more than without it and was enough that it will be in my regular routine.For this I used a clay bar first, then this polish, then three applications of the NXT wax and the car looks great. removes fine scratches, not anything deep into the paint.  But gets out minor scrapes and scratches.  Put a coat of wax on the area after using this product and it will shine beautifully. 
Almost too bright, but I love it.  Maybe the 100 watt model would be better than these 130's if your eyes are sensitive to bright lights.  Exactly what my 2004 Dodge Ram needed because the factory headlights stink.  My brights were no brighter than my low beam, and my old 1985 Nissan had brighter brights, but these KC 130 watt driving lights solved that problem perfectly.  For not being the full, long range lights KC offers, they sure shine pretty far, plus spread the light out to the sides and up into the trees, a good long range / flood combination.  I mounted them to my push/brush guard.  Took about 3 hours to install because I like to route, hide, and secure the wires very well.  I connected the white switch / relay hot wire to my high beam (brights)wire on the drivers side, so they go on and off with my high / low switch, plus I have the master switch mounted (without the switch frame) near the dash to keep the KC lights off completely if I want.  Just make sure you dim your lights (turn off the KC's) before you see anyone ahead of you or you'll blind them and can get a ticket if on a public road.  First night I tried them a big 8 point ran across the road in front of me, then stopped and pretty much "tip toed" off the road as if he was totally blind and afraid to move.  So beware of animals freezing in front of you with these things.  I turned them off and honked so he could run away.  And no, I don't hunt that way.The wiring diagram on the outside of the box did not show the white power / relay wire, as if it was pre-wired into the main power wire, but luckily there was the white power / relay wire available to tap into my high beam wire.  The wiring diagram on the directions in the box was correct.  Some vehicles newer than 1999 may not allow tapping into the high beam wire because of the vehicle's computer that senses voltage changes, but it worked on mine.  Only thing I had to supply was a sheet metal screw to secure the relay.  I cut off about 5 feet of extra wire that went to the switch.  The length of wire to the lights was just right. Installed these with the KC windsheild mounts on my 90 YJ. The harness and instructions were really easy to follow .Installed in less than 2 hours with everything tied down and hidden. My wife and I were out in the jeep looking at Christmas lights and I was on a dark road and flipped them on. WOW! These 130W daylighters definetely light up the road. They were so bright my wife asked if they were legal.Several things, you have two grounds, make sure they are grounded to a good metal surface, I used sandpaper to remove the paint about the size of a dime for my grounding points both in the engine compartment.If you have a narrow mounting location, you may want to consider the slim lights, these are heavy and shaped like a motorcyle headlight.The only negative thing I can say is that the light covers with the smiley face went out in the 80's. I painted mine black and placed a vinyl KC sticker on them. Looks much better, but still ordered the KC rock light covers so you can turn them on at any time without removing them. (5 stars if they would have come with a rock guard cover, instead of the solid yellow smiley faces.) I have my daylighters mounted near the side pillars of my pickup and these guards clean up the look nicely. It also cuts down on the glare that shines onto the hood from my mounting location. I cant tell a huge difference on light output, so that is a plus. They lock on so secure that I have actually cut my hand on them trying to get them off. Wont lose them on the trail and its a nice deterrent to anyone looking to walk by and just pull it off to walk off with it. 
Easy to install. I used my own screws because of the material that I was mounting the bracket on. I had to tape one of the light adapter plugs as it was a loose fit in the bracket. The relay setup is a breeze, if you want to make things easy just connect the aux plug directly to the power plug & horn will work at all times, rather than just when the car is on. You CANNOT take the bolt off on the back, dont try to, the covers can be removed and painted with ease by removing the black screws around the bezel. Also, we cut & drilled a new hole on the bracket to place them where we wanted them & that bracket is made of reinforced Steele & took forever to drill through. Excellent product I installed this brake controller in a 1955 GMC pickup truck that I use for towing. Just follow the diagram for wiring and it just works like a breeze. I like the way you can adjust easily the voltage with the dial on the left and the mounts provided allows you to install it a convenient location under the dash (it works in any position).If you want to install this in a more modern truck without tapping directly into the wires, you will need additional adapters at extra cost. 
I grew up in the 80's so I remember well playing with Legos.  Building everying from cars to forts.  Well the Tri Lynx Comapny has brought us back our nostalic youth with Tri Lynx Levelers.  These are large square plastic pads (roughly 9"x9"x1" thick) that are stackable to just about any confgiuration you can imagine.  You can stack them in a "column" fasion for leveling jacks.  Or you can stack them in an offset alternating "brick wall" fasion for an interlocking leveler that is safe to drive on without fear of displacement.  They can even be stacked side by side for larger duel wheel RVs.  For my use, I wanted to use them for my leveling jacks and for pads were there was a side leaning tilt.  The box says to never stack more than 4 levelers high for a single configuration.  I've gone to 10 under my jacks and they still feel rock solid once pressure is put on them.I'm on my 4th set of Lynx levelers.  I'm convinced you can't have too many.  With that I fianlly invested in these "Stop'n Chocks"  Wonderful!!!  As I said these can be used under your wheels as well.  So the Stop n' Chalk stacks as the last piece at the rear of the Lynx configuration to allow the driver  just back up against them.  Now these are the most versitle set of leveling / chalking pads you can buy becasue they allow for front to rear leveling and side to side leveling.  If one side of the coach is lower than the other, you can build up just that side and use standard chalks on the other.  Also if you have enough of the Tri Lynx levelers you could potentially place say 2" of lift under a front axel on an tandem configuration and 4 or even 5" under a rear.  The one draw back is that you would need enough to building this as one continous pad (say 8' long or so.)  But like legos, if you have enough, your imagination is the limit.A couple of notes:  You MUST use these in conjunction with TriLynx levelers.  They will not work on their own.  In addition there is a noctch carved out of the front to force the user to stack in the above mentioned "brick wall" alternating fasion so that there's no risk of sepertaion between the levels as the rig is driving on or off the pad.  Also, I stongly suggest a spotter!  Driving a rig on or off a 9" wide "rail" is dangerous and having someone to tell you that you a little too close to the edge is a must. We have an SUV. I would normally setup the side view mirrors so that when viewing the rear view mirrors and side view mirrors, there is just a bit of overlap when looking at them. This presents a problem when backing up as you cannot see the curbs clearly. So this helps a lot. The side mirrors are now just looking straight back helping in parallel parking as well backing up to a curb. These mirrors help in making sure that when you are driving and changing lanes, you can see if there is any object in your blindspot without glancing over your shoulders. Great mirrors and to this day, they remain clear. I will get another one - the smaller version of these mirrors - for my sedan. our 32' travel trailer w/ three slideouts has the factory electric stabilizer jacks at the front and back, which are great at stabilizing the ends.  But in between these, over the axles, we can feel the trailer flex and slightly bounce especially when we are entertaining & have folks congregate in the middle.  These work really well when placed just in front of the tires.  We simply crank them up snug against the frame rail on each side.  Now the trailer doesn't bounce or wiggle nearly at all.  Too bad RV manufacturers on long wheel base units don't add in a third stabilizer in the mid section to keep up/down flex movement of leaf springs & tires from causing bounce feeling. We also have the BAL X-jacks between the tires to prevent any roll effect from front to back. 
The &#34;feet&#34; on this bar slides off the truck bed sides and makes it worthless.When the ratchet is extended, the mechanism for that ends up out of arms reach when standing outside the truck. I highly recommend these mirrors. I did a lot of looking and comparing before I bought these. I have a 2006 Toyota Tacoma and these things fit well and do a real nice job. They vibrate a little but not excessive. The little bit of vibration I see doesn't interfere with my view. I also do not extend them very far. The further out you go with them the more they will vibrate. Just extend to the minimum needed in order to be able to see.Before attaching to the vehicle I think it's a good idea to loosen the three screws holding the swivel in place on the bottom of the mirrors and work in a drop of oil. Then do not over tighten these screws. They don't have to be very tight to hold the mirror still and not over tightening allows easy adjustment later. If you find they move when you close the door you can tighten a little more but to start off, finger tight with the screwdriver is all you need. I also placed a couple drops of oil on the aluminum sliding bar and worked it in before attaching. Also, when you bolt the mirror onto the aluminum slide bar, grip the base (the part with the internal threads) with a vise-grip or something (not too tight to crush it), then make sure the lock nut is between the bolt and the bar on the bottom, and then screw the bolt into the base (and through the aluminum slide bar) nice and tight without letting the base turn. You'll notice there are &#34;teeth&#34; on the bottom of the base. These are supposed to sink into the bar as you tighten the bolt. They keep the base from turning when you adjust the mirror. This is another good reason to not overtighten the three screws around the swivel. You want to be able to adjust the mirror from side to side and have it turn only at the swivel and without causing the base to turn against the aluminum slide bar.The bracket will bend the weather stripping on the outside of the window a little. It springs back when the mirror is removed but some of it will be permanent. It's not a big deal and you'll just have to deal with this if you want to use these mirrors. It is not a detriment to the operation of the window.I installed them as far forward as possible so that the top of the bracket was parallel to the ground and the new mirror sits right beside my existing one towards the outside. Tightening the ratchet by hand produced plenty of tension to hold it securely. Releasing the ratchet is another matter. It's too tight to just push it down with your finger. To release the tension I use a short piece of rope and loop it under the sliding buckle. Then I stand right next to the truck with the rope looped around one hand and my other hand on the ratchet release tab. I use my body leverage (knees and back) to pull upward on the rope a little which takes just enough pressure off the belt to allow me to press the ratchet release tab. You don't need to back the ratchet off very far - just enough to get the hook out from under the door. Then just close up the bracket and wrap up the belt around it and you're all pre-set for the next time.For better stability I advise when you're adjusting the belt, place the sliding buckle as necessary so that the crossbar forming the angle is not extended very far, if at all. And, yes, make sure there isn't any dirt behind the buckle or you'll get a scuff mark.You should have the windows all the way down when attaching to the vehicle. The bracket comes close to the window so you need to be careful not to let it scratch the window. After you get the mirror on I advise to raise the window very slowly to make sure that the metal bracket is not contacting (scratching) the window as you raise it. Once you're under way - be sure not to lower the window if there is any sand or debris laying on the bracket right next to the window or a scratch may occur from this action also. I've taken these off and on several times now and we've travelled with them and I've been relatively careful and have never had one scratch my window.On my truck, the doors fit really well and I can tell the difference when the hook for the mirror strap is hooked under the door. The door fits just a tad more tightly than usual. It has to be closed just a slight bit harder to make the latch engage and when I open the door it pops out ever so slightly because of the extra tension produced by the hook being in there on the bottom. I don't see this as a problem. The mirrors are not on there all the time and, even if they were, I think the latch mechanism on the Toyota is stout enough to handle it without any long term problems developing. Just be aware that the hook will slightly change thge way the door latches.The instructions are good, too. Not the usual loosely translated Mandarin. I've tried to supplement here with my own experience. I used this to replace a boat trailer jack that was welded on and didn't have a wheel. Installed very quickly but had to cut down the bolts as they were too long in my case. Rolls up and down very easy. 
First of all, American cars mostly using low wattage light bulbs (which is good cause most misadjusted lights don't bother you that much) and power supplied through the headlight switch.Therefore, lights are not really "bright". Also, if you have old or worn headlight, the best bulbs won't make a difference.I used these bulbs in a '99 Marquis, except for the lights to appear much whiter; we did not notice any difference in brightness. Lights and reflectors were in great shape.At the same time we put them into a '99 Intrepid, and wow, what a difference!First off all: The headlight color is white. This is even more dramatic at a clear night, when sitting next to a car without these bulbs.Second: They are slightly brighter. Don't believe any of the ads telling you that you can suddenly see 100 feet further, this is impossible due to legality as you would blind oncoming traffic. But the beam is wider; you have a bigger "spot of light" in front of you.Third: During rain, I found that these lights provide a sharper contrast between the falling rain (clear raindrops) and other objects. The beam of light on the road seems to be "crisper".End of story: I think they are worth it. I own a 2002 Nissan Frontier and the OEM headlight bulbs were the regular Sylvania 9007 halogens. These OEM's have tremendous life but I noticed that they are starting to fade out, their brightness are decreasing significantly. Time to change and I opted for the Silverstar Ultra after seeing it in a TV commercial and based on my experience with the OEM's. After installing it, I noticed that they were only marginally whiter and brighter than the OEM's. The huge difference was in the angle where the beam of the light is being projected--it is much more wider than the OEM's. I work night shifts and there is a significant stretch in my drive where the roads are really, really dark. With the Silverstar Ultra's, its like your fog lamps are turned on too because of the wider angle of light projection. Overall satisfied with these bulbs but again, the brightness and whiteness are only marginal. Nevertheless, its a worthwhile purchase. My rare 1970 Chevy is about to get upgraded headlights. Have not installed them yet so I can't say I love them yet. From what I've seen, these DOT approved, glass lens, metal bodied units, with heavy dust covers, will not be noticeable to a novice eye. Look at the photos on the desription page, there were no surprises for me. "Cool Nova."HELLA 002395301 Vision Plus 165mm High/Low Beam 12V Halogen Conversion Headlamp (HB2)x 2. 
The pair of levels are a great value.  I recently purchased these for a second time, as the originals were sold with my previous trailer and I wanted to make my new trailer easier to get on a level stance.There really isn't much to go wrong as far as product failure is concerned.  Accuracy is up to you with the initial installation.Recommended method of installation is to get your trailer level/RV, front to back, and side to side.  Once you have your trailer true, install the graduated levels in locations which will show you front to back level (placed on the side of the trailer) and side to side (place on the front or back of the trailer).  Make sure the bubble indicates "level" by being in the center point of the tube.Installation should be done once all your components are "stressed" as they will be for trailer/RV use (I.E. front tongue on a travel trailer, all the normal weight sitting on the winch foot, or in the case of 5th wheels/motorcoaches, landing gear down), try to place the levels on the RV in clear view of the winch/landing gear controls to enable leveling without having to relocate to a different location to view the levels.I accomplished this on a travel trailer by placing one level on the very front center, and the other on the side of the frame tongue close to the winch.  Though small, with sharp eye-sight, you can take advantage of the one on the front of the trailer as you position the trailer to see if you can establish a level side to side stance as you near your desired location.On my 5th wheel, my landing gear controls are on the front corner of the main body.  I placed one on the side of the rig for front to back level, and another right around the corner on the front side (for side to side level) still within sight of the controls, as well as from the truck cab for backing up.  Even though the level is off center, if it is installed properly with the trailer level at the time of installation, it will work fine.As far as the graduated scales are concerned, you will have to find your "scale" for adjustments, as it depends on where the levels are placed in reference to the center of the pivot points.The levels come with a self adhesive foam strip on the back for placement as well as two holes for screws if you wish to drill holes in the side of your rig.  I go with the adhesive strip route, as I don't like unnecessary holes.  The only negative with the adhesive strips is they will flex if stressed and it can put the levels off level, though this only happened to me with the first pair after the foam tape aged a few years.One last comment . . .the green bubble tube will fade from extended UV exposure.  It will not interfere with the accuracy, just makes it a little harder to read.If you are looking for larger levels which can be read from a distance, I know they are out there, but I have no experience with them to make a comparison.  I do not wish to clutter the appearance of the rig with large levels. I highly recommend these mirrors. I did a lot of looking and comparing before I bought these. I have a 2006 Toyota Tacoma and these things fit well and do a real nice job. They vibrate a little but not excessive. The little bit of vibration I see doesn't interfere with my view. I also do not extend them very far. The further out you go with them the more they will vibrate.

Once in place between the wheels on a tandem axle trailer, there's no way the trailer will move.  Cool! 
Hella Replacement.  Kinda.  Mine came with BLUE wire.. they should always be white. Its also not covered in fabric and the white ones are. There are two horns, not one. One is 400Hz and the other one is 500Hz.PIAA | Automotive Sports Horn (400/500Hz) #85110The are exact fits on the mounts as the OEM horns and use the same bolts. A 1/4 inch drive ratchet and a 12mm socket is needed to remove and install the bolt. They came with grounding leads with ring spade lugs that mounted readily under the existing M6 bolts on the radiator supports. All you need is a 10mm socket.The two wiring harness leads are too short to connect the horns. Two wire tie mounts hold the harness to the aluminum bumper reinforcement. You can cut off the ties and use the OEM harness to connect the horns, but I chose not to.  I prefer NOT to cut off the OEM connector blocks.I made two pigtail extensions out of 18 gauge black primary wire, 5 inches long. One end needs a 1/4 inch wide exposed male quick disconnect. The other end needs an insulated female 1/4 inch quick disconnect terminal. Since I used 18 gauge wire, I used the red coded ones.The exposed male connector slides into the OEM horn connector perfectly. The female one clips easily onto the positive terminal of each horn.The horns how have a weather shield on the apertures.Best thing to my surprise is that they appear to be very high quality and Made in Japan.Also nice is that they need no modification to the horn relay or circuit. I did not carefully read reviews before placed my order.  Few buyer pointed out the product feature has changed.  According ad photo, It suppose has green and red indicator lights but only comes with one single red light, green light feature is omitted.  Red light means AC power is on but no way to tell it is actually charging or not?  For only one red light version, you can pay less than half price from other seller for similar product at Amazon. 
the ones I received are not identical to the picture.  one can only be installed on the side and the other can only be installed on the front (or back).  the markings are different for left to right level vs front to back level. These caps fit on top of the Tri Lynx levelers (Tri Lynx 00015 (10)  Lynx Leveler) or by themselves, for under stabilizer jacks or the hitch jack (if you have a light trailer).  They can also be used on top of the levelers, for under the tire(s) to level your RV.  I don't know how much weight they can bare, but they do well with my 3,400lb trailer for all of the uses described above. I grew up in the 80's so I remember well playing with Legos.  Building everying from cars to forts.  Well the Tri Lynx Comapny has brought us back our nostalic youth with Tri Lynx Levelers.

Also, I stongly suggest a spotter!  Driving a rig on or off a 9" wide "rail" is dangerous and having someone to tell you that you a little too close to the edge is a must. 
I bought two of these one for mysely and the other for my son inlaw. Both will be used for a flag pole mount on the back of his truck an the other on my motorhome. Put threaded rod through the ball mount hole ant PVC pipe on the threaded rod .It works out great.Cant beat the price for this mount and PVC is cheap. Good Item for the price.  You may have to bend the mounting bracket slightly. Be careful and make sure both sides of the bracket bend evenly or you will not get the bolt through into the footpeg. Nice to have something other than a standard flat or Phillips head screw if you have a nice plate frame or even a backup camera mounted over your plates. If your mounting screws go straight into your car rather than taking the lock nuts behind a bracket, these screws will most likely be too big to fit. I just drilled out the plastic pieces that were mounted to my car and then just threaded these in. Ended up with a nice tight fit. Add the little plastic caps for a nice clean look.Cruiser Accessories 82050 Screw Covers, Black

If you ride around the roads of south Florida then you need this product in your tires. You will not have a flat ever again if you follow the dirrections ! It works IT WORKS this stuff is amazing, works perfectly, Gas stays very functional all winter, in the boat, Lawn mower, and i use it in the snow blower over the summer.  fantastico 
This Actron CP9125 is an invaluable tool in that it allows you to clear the CEL (check engine light) without having to disconnect the battery and risk possibly causing another problem.  If, for example, your gas cap is left loose and the CEL comes on, you can immediately reset the CEL rather than panic and go to the stealership.  But most people don't realize the OBD-II (on-board diagnostics) will actually self reset after a number of cycles, but few people understand the testing cycle process. It is smart to give warning lights as it can differentia between battery and alternator voltage. you cars computer (ECU/PCM)  monitors the tank for pressure; if you lose tank pressure,  (bad)any autostore can scan yOUR CAR for free, and see "P0440 to P0499 and others.)  EVAP failure , in laymen terms the tank leaks  fumes (nasty smog it is)you can buy a scan tool for $7 , off some bay dot com.  sure can.you can look up the error codes called DTCs at any time for free, there,http://www.myscantool.com/dtc/powertrain.htmlmy 02 jeep wrangler has a bad cap, and is on recall, (look up TSB)  and has a revised cap if buying one new from dealer.all 2002 caps are bad, they slip and will not come off, standing you.the dealer is not cheating you if you drive in , and the CEL (check engine lamp is out)  he cant fix it, if it is not broke. or throwing DTCs./These fact apply to all cars 1996 to Present, it's not something new, or unique at all.The ecu can be rest (scan tool) after replacing the cap or you can wait for 3 driving cycles to clear it. its your choice.There is a third way to reset, but varies by car, the ECU memory input power.  you pull a fuse and the ECU forgets and resets, to a new car settings.the cap has  a vacuum breaker inside, if you use a cap that has none, you will collapse your tank and destroy the fuel pump rack and sometimes the pump.so getting a real OEM spec. cap, will save all that bad news....ymmv, retired, mech. 
The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around! Very quick and easy mounting and really adds to the look of the rear of the Jeep.  These are metal and not a cheap plastic and mount with included screws into the existing lens cover screw holes. Truly an impressive assembly of 4 parts. If there is a finer example of a little piece of rubbery roll-y wheel attached to a wooden handle with some metal parts in the middle tying it all together, show me. 
Does the job for which it was intended. Added to HOT water and dissolved, pour it into the base of the Air-O-Swiss humidifier to clean any 'scaling' and other 'old water' contaminants. Then thoroughly rinse (without dunking the base under water) and do this about every 2 months. It is a shutoff, does what it is supposed to. Camco 40003 RV Water Tank Filler with Shutoff Valve.  would buy again This works very well for blowing out water supply lines in an RV's plumbing system.  Be aware that there can be water still in the lines even after blowing out air through every faucet, so when winterizing, it can't hurt to use a RV safe antifreeze just to keep the water at the low spots (elbows, valves) from freezing. 
Takes some time, but if you do it right, this product has held up very well. Will use it on all of my cars and trucks. I use the Black & Decker ASI300 Air Station Inflator for a variety of things, including:* Riding lawn mower tires* Riding mower trailer tires* Car tires* Rafts* Basketballs and footballI love it because it is:* Portable* Affordable* Easy to use (set the air pressure, plug it in, and it shuts off automatically).I keep mine in the truck of the car next to my battery-jumper unit, but I use it all around the home. I highly recommend this product if you have riding mowers, especially. It's easy enough to get air for your car's tires (though that is still a pain in the neck) but there's no easy way to fill up your riding mower's tires. This little gem is ideal. I have a tandem-axel trailer, and the suspension is such that when one tire is on this Leveler, the trailer is NOT lifted high enough to get the 2nd tire off the ground too.  This has the effect of putting unevenly distributed weight on the axels AND limiting the leveling effect.If you have a single axel, this will work GREAT.  I'm still giving this 5-starts based on it's solid construction and how easy it is to back up onto a stepped ramp.  But, if you have tandem axels AND their suspension is like mine...you'll need to pass on this one.  I gave mine to a friend with a single-axel tent-trailer, and he loves it. 
Bought this to use withValterra F02-4100 45 RV Hydroflushso I could wash out my tanks.Here is my review of that setuphttp://www.amazon.com/Valterra-F02-4100-45%C2%B0-RV-Hydroflush/product-reviews/B0002UHVAA/ref=cm_cr_dp_synop?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints;=0&sortBy;=bySubmissionDateDescending#R2CUAU2B8XC98QIt works great.I also like that I have this as an emergency backup if one of my valves ever fails. A nice charger. Is also smaller than it appears on the picture. So easy to carry and handle.Unfortunately I had to send it back because it just has the standard clamps to charge.There were no &#34;Quick Disconnect Extension&#34; option to easy plug-n-charge a motorcycle.So I bought the &#34;Black & Decker BM3B 6V and 12V Battery Charger / Maintainer&#34;:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051D3MP6/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0 I was looking for a general purpose multimeter for troubleshooting the starter on my 97 geo metro, I got this and I'm extremely satisfied with the product, I was able to check the voltage of the ignition switch and found that I had a faulty starter, I was able to get theDB Electrical SMT0054 Starter Chevy Metro 1.0L 1.3L 98 99 00 01 30005925and it worked great. I was also able to test the voltage on a coin battery, this product is great! Highly recommended! 
The meter has all the functions you could ask for a multimeter in a compact size.  The digits are large for the size of the meter, so it's easily readable by middle aged eyes. The Tender Jr. does not come with a cigarette adapter so I cut this in half to make two. I purchased 2 lighter plugs for a buck each from China&#8230; with free shipping&#8230; and they are working fine. These aren&#8217;t an exact match with the Tender cables but they fit together OK and are easy to determine polarity with the wire colors. You can also just use this as an extension cord for your Tender. The description states a length of 12-inches&#8230; but it&#8217;s actually 14-inches tip-to-tip on the connectors. Nice item for the price and it&#8217;s made in Mexico. It does get a bit warm while providing the 5 amps of power to the Koolatron car cooler (which I took into hotel rooms at night), but it did exactly what it was supposed to do so can't complain. One issue: There are two different sizes for so-called "cigarette lighter" outlets. This has the "big" size, which means "small" size plugs can have issues. Solution if that is a problem for your particular plug is simply to use a toothpick to "shim" the small-size plug into the large-size socket. 
Of all the battery chargers on the market, the Battery Tender is the best.  The device is small and portable, works exceptionally well for maintaining batteries and does not over charge (over charging can decrease the overall life of your battery).  It is simple to operate and can be left hooked up to a dormant battery while it is not in use.  The Battery Tender can be used while the battery is hooked up to a vehicle/mower/etc. or not.  Highly recommended. I comparison shop a lot before buying anything - hopefully you can benefit from my time investment and review. I am very pleased with this battery maintainer.  I purchased the cigarette light plug along with this unit and it is so easy to use.  I plugged it in, set it to normal charge and brought a totally discharged battery back to life.  The battery is holding the charge just fine and I couldn't be happier.  I especially like the &#34;supply&#34; mode on this unit so I can change out a battery without losing the codes on my car.  No one should be without this charger.  I have a car that sits in the garage and used sparingly and this device keeps the battery fully charged. I have used this charger many times to charge the battery in a car that sits outside and I rarely drive. The voltage and percent charge display is very nice.  Very easy to use 
Does what it is designed to do and Amazon has great prices on them. But, if you are replacing yours on a ford f-250 with 5.4 go with 15718 with the longer cord. And a 2003 f250 w/5.4L only has 2 not 4 like it shows. My last same-sized container anti-seize, standing at attention, lasting me 30 years (home use), so my children will finish this one.About it:It's silver in color, 8-oz. container (a bunch), -65F - 1600F, Anti-Seize, -Corrosion and -Galling; has Lid Brush; label indicates "Made in USA".Specific Use: Ease assembly and disassembly of hardware which experience extreme temperatures and/or corrosive conditions.I've used this routinely, and sparingly for it does not take much - just a light swipe on threads, mating surfaces etc.  Most of my last container went to lubricating boat and boat engine components for very good saltwater corrosion prevention.A general caution is: not apply to business end of sparkplug, O2 sensor etc (lightly on threads/sealing surface only) - else could impact component performance (never seen it happen lol).*UPDATE: I visited Permatex website - wished I'd done so earlier ...

I have several Classic cars, a motorcycle battery, and two boat batteries that I need to keep charged, so I purchased the Battery Tender 4-Bank Battery Management System to help me keep the batteries at the optimum charge level over long periods of non-use.I have had several batteries go bad from overcharging on regular battery chargers, and from sulphating when not using or charging them for extended periods.  I decided to get the Deltran 4-Bank system to extend the useful life of my batteries  and hopefully, it will pay for itself in prolonged battery life for all of my different battery applications. I see a lot of negative reviews for this charger that I think are partially due to Amazon's incorrect description and the fact that most people don't know what size or type of charger they need. (including myself)I am a practicing Electronic engineer with more than 20yrs experience. I did not know much about battery chargers until recently researching what a good battery charger should do.1) this charger only delivers a max of 1.5A. This means if you try to charge a discharged auto battery (48AH) it will take a long long time. This charger does work great for topping off a car battery at 70% (12.4V).2) The instructions included clearly state the charger will automatically shut-off after 12 hours of charging. The charger will restart and continue charging if you unplug and then plug the charger in again. Best to get a higher capacity charger.3) This charger does have a float mode sort of. Actually it shuts off the charging current and monitors battery voltage. When the battery voltage drops low enough the charger cycles on to top it off and then shuts off again.MY SUMMARY 1st:I like this charger and think it does a good job for the PRICE. Gold box special was $15.20 + tax. (I would definitely buy it at the regular price for $3$)It's basically automatic. Don't have to set the voltage and it won't damage anything if you reverse the clips accidently. Compact size and reasonable quality clamps.This charger does what it is designed for. That is charge small batteries and top off larger automotive batteries. This is an excellent maintenance charger for all batteries to keep them fully charged when not in use. (My opinion)Personally I would not leave any charger connected to my battery for more than 24 hours. Now I use a cheap mechanical timer that is set to turn on for 1 hour every 24 hours. I would prefer a timer that I can set to turn on twice a week for a few hours.The charger is small feels solidly built with heavy plastic. It gets very warm aftercharging at 1.5A but not warm enough to be concerned. (no cooling fan)I gave this charger 5 stars because PRICE and performance is very good. Build quality is good as well.AMAZON DESCRIPTION (Poor): is incorrect in that this charger is not intended to be used to charge a LOW (discharged) car battery. The chart in the DESCRIPTION that shows the charging times is different than the manual.. The included MANUAL has a chart that states this charger should only be used as a "top off" or maintenance charger for auto batteries. In addition the charger in charging mode automatically shuts off after 12 hours of charging. (A good safety feature in my opinion.)Charging details:I discharged a car/truck jump start battery pack to 12.45V or approx 75% charge.(Typical full charge is 12.65V to 12.7V. To discharge the battery I used a battery/alternator tester. I have a voltmeter attached to charger and a current meter in series with battery and battery charger negative terminal.1) At the start of the charge, the charge current was 0.78A and then jumped to 1.52A in a few minutes.2) After 1 hour the charge current is 1.47A. Charge voltage is 13.0V.3) After 2 hours the charge current is 1.48A. Charge voltage is 13.25V.4) After 3 hours the charge current is 1.43A. Charge voltage is 13.46V.5) After 4 hours the charge current is 1.40A. Charge voltage is 13.82V.Note: that the charge current is decreasing as the battery is approaching full charge. This design feature will prevent overheating and extend the life of your battery.6) After 5 hours the charge current is 0.68A. Charge voltage is 14.71V.7) After 5.5 hours the charge current is 0.35A. Charge voltage is 14.67V.8) After 6 hours the charge current is 0.29A. Charge voltage is 14.73V.9) After 6.5 hours the charge current is 0.24A. Charge voltage is 14.72V.10) After 8.5 hours the charge current is 0.20A. Charge voltage is 14.73V.11) After 10.5 hours the charge current is 0.15A. Charge voltage is 14.71V.12) After 11.5 hours the charge is COMPLETE and the charge current has dropped to 0.0A. BATTERY voltage is 13.55V and declining. Charger is in the monitor mode. In monitor mode the charger AC power is 3W measured with a Belkin Watt meter.Almost 12 hours seems like a long time to charge a battery and this isn't even a full capacity car battery. But, it did a good job of gently charging the battery especially when it was near full charge. The important thing to me is the charging current declined as the battery neared full charge. This prevents overcharging and truly tops off the battery to maximum capacity.I tested the battery the next day with a battery tester and it passed well within the "good battery" full charge limits. The results were much better than the charger that came with the battery pack where it tested NEAR "weak".Very happy with the purchase. I would buy this exact model again. Should there be any problem(s) in the future I will update this review.Ships from and sold by Amazon. I preferr this over the other brands due to warranty. Battery Tender warranty a joke, They charge shipping and repair cost under their warranty. I replaced my Battery Tender w/ these. I have used this brand on my tractor and 4 wheelers. I am getting over 5 years of battery life on both w/ this. 
I ordered 2 different chargers to maintain my gate opener's deep cycle battery (a simple 4 output charger with extension cords for charging other deep cycle batteries from amazonBattery Tender 022-0148-DL-WH 12V 4-Bank Battery Management System) and this unit has a far superior charging design.The 4 bank battery tender does a simple fast rate charge then switches to a trickle charge at a constant voltage with 4 outputs.This unit pulses the battery under charge and features 3 operating modes with different current outputs for different sized batteries. The selections are motorcycle which also works well for SLA gel cells or AGM batteries, standard automotive starting battery, deep cycle batttery, and off.What makes the CTEK unit special is that it uses a pulse charge in all modes to attempt to desulphate batteries, while the battery tender does not.  This method of charging has proven successful in restoring lead acid batteries that won't take a charge any more.It comes with a waterproof 12V output cable and a set of clips or rings for permanent installation under the hood of your car.  In addition to the LEDs for indicating the type of battery being charged, a second set is provided for empty, 1/2 full, and maintenance pulse charge mode.There is also a noticable increase in quality between the battery tender and this unit - small details like a water sealed housing and gaskets on the connectors indicate quality in manufacture.For a single 12V lead chemistry battery this is a useful, well made tool. Mine arrived perfect, simple to open packaging, and works as expected. Easy to use and comes with clamps and permanently installed wires if desired. This does not delufate, nor start a car, and at low amps would take weeks to recharge a drained battery, deep-cycle AGM or Gel type, as this is a very low amp trickler/float charger. Most AGM's require a special 3-4 staged 10-30 amp charger. Once the battery is charged this will do its job of tending/maintaining a full charge on any 12 volt DC lead-acid battery. I also have two Battery MINDers for our RV and towed that are garaged over the winter and a Tender plus for a truck. You need close access to an outlet or a properly sized extension cord and you can leave the battery attached, in the vehicle. I recommend this, would buy again, and hope this helps someone. I purchased this to charge and Maintain batteries but the unit I got does not maintain at all and the cooling fan never operates no matter what amp charge setting. Connected to a car battery I start charging and it shows battery is at 70% which is nice and after full charge at 100% the charger goes into Charge/Maintain mode but that's where it stops working like others have reported...came back to the battery after two days and the battery isn't charged and so I unplug the charger and plug it back in and it shows battery at 52%. The battery is connected to 4 10 watt LED lights that come on after dark for 6 hours so I expected this charger to start charging when the battery is down but that is not the case like how my last battery charger/maintainer worked. It only seems to charge and not maintain so It's being returned to Amazon.Don't trust it to keep a battery maintain.Update. Amazon replace charger and was quick about it...but the new charger arrived DOA and now on the way back to Amazon for refund. Done with this brand. 
Another reviewer mentioned this charger puts out 15.0V in AGM mode and that's too many volts for some AGM batteries and it caused his to outgas (reducing the battery's life).  My Optima yellow top AGM battery is rated for 15V charging so I thought this charger would be okay for it, but the charger I got puts out 15.5V!  I did find specs that say 15.6V "regulated voltage" is okay for "rapid charging" on my battery but they don't define what rapid charging means.  They do say with 15.6V to "charge until current drops below 1 amp" which I think means you can do 15.6V until the battery gets closer to being charged and stops accepting high amperage.  Unfortunately this charger does the exact opposite, starting at lower voltage and increasing to 15.5V around when it decides the battery is at 90% charge (which seems to equate to about 12.6 or 12.7V on my battery).  The charger keeps outputting 15.5V until the battery is fully charged, which may take hours, so it seems unlikely that's good for most batteries and I'm pretty sure it's against the charging specs on my battery.  Note that the charger shows 15.4V on its readout but my volt meter shows it's actually 15.5V.Nevertheless I let it keep doing 15.5V and checked periodically to make sure the battery wasn't hot (it never even felt warm and an IR temperature gun read 86F max) and wasn't hissing (hissing would mean it was overcharged and releasing gas, permanently reducing its life).  It took almost exactly 12 hours for the charger to decide it was 100% charged and go into maintenance mode, but when it did, it picked 12.4V!  AGM batteries are supposed to be charged at around 13.6V for maintenance (float) charging, so I have no idea why it picked 12.4V.  I left it on for another hour and it actually reduced the voltage to 12.3, at which point I took it off the charger.  Volt meter said the battery was at 12.31V.I can't decide if this charger is broken, has a weird charging algorithm, or is actually very smart.  I say that because my battery was discharged to about 3.5V a few weeks ago, well below the voltage it's designed to be discharged to (it's a "deep cycle" but even deep cycles don't tolerate discharging below 50%, and even below 10.5V may hurt them), so it's now damaged and won't hold the full 13.6V it's supposed to.  Instead, if I leave it on the charger at 15.5V for an hour, it hits 12.8V and then quickly loses charge to 12.5V in about 30 minutes.  So maybe the charger somehow figured that out and decided that 12.4V was "full charge" on my damaged battery so that's what it used as its float charge.  I don't see how it could determine that if the battery was 12.8V or higher after the long 15.5V charge, but who knows.I also don't know if 15.4V is really bad for my battery, or for the "average AGM".  I spent awhile researching but couldn't find any real authoritative information, just a bunch of people theorizing.  Since it's above the 15V standard charge on the battery spec sheet I don't think it's a good thing, but then again I also found research (nrel dot gov/vehiclesandfuels/energystorage/pdfs/evs17pres.pdf) showing that seriously overvolting a yellow top battery to 17V under certain conditions actually increases its life.  So I don't know what to think, but I'm leaning towards thinking it's a bad thing to go against the manufacturer's spec sheet unless you're in a lab using specialized chargers.What I do know is that the desulfination feature on this charger didn't do a thing for my damaged battery.  In fact I don't think it even kicked in.  I connected the charger to a small sealed lead acid battery that I left unused for too long and it went into desulfination mode (I think - the manual doesn't say how you're supposed to know) for over 8 hours pumping 16.8V into the battery until it said "bad bat" on its screen and stopped charging.  In all that time the battery never showed over 15% charged on the charger, though it did end up holding about 10.9V.  In my online research it was mentioned in a few places that there are no studies showing desulfination actually works so I'm pretty dubious about it.  It definitely didn't work on either of my batteries.It was also interesting to note that the sealed lead acid battery never got warm, which I find rather curious considering how long it was putting in such a high voltage.  I had the charger connected to a kill-a-watt meter and it showed the charger was pulling only 0.15amps and 9watts, and this is in 2amp charging mode, so maybe the charger is smart enough to use low amperage when it's using high voltage and that prevents the battery from getting damaged.  When it was pushing 15.4V to my AGM battery it was only drawing 0.35amps and it actually reduced the amps to 0.29 as it got closer to 100% charged.  So maybe that protects the battery from overvoltage damage, but I don't know enough to be sure.  Maybe a battery expert will chime in in the comments.Another important thing to consider is that desulfination mode could damage your car's electronics if you don't remove the battery from the car to charge it.  16.8V is more than most cars were designed to handle, and I found someone mentioning that BMW warns not to use chargers that do things like that, so it's definitely a concern.  I don't know if I feel comfortable using this charger again without removing the battery from the car.  Some chargers claim to somehow magically detect the presence of car electronics and limit their voltage, but this charger says nothing about that in its manual.Other than all that, the design of the charger is nice.  Wires fit into a pocket beneath the retractable handle.  It will show you the battery voltage on its readout until you tell it to start charging (although it reads 0.1 to 0.2V lower than my volt meter, which is annoying).  A button lets you toggle between display of voltage or battery percent.  It lets you choose standard, AGM, and gel cell, and choose from three rates of charge.  The slower 2A charge rate is supposed to be better for many batteries, so use 2A or 6A if you aren't in a hurry.  I tried both those modes and it still puts out 15.5V in 6A mode but it puts out 15.3V in 2A mode.Since this is a dedicated 12V charger you don't have to worry about it "autodetecting" (actually, auto-misdetecting) your discharged 12V battery as a 6V and never charging it past 6V, which is a problem with far too many chargers these days.Despite its nice controls and smart form factor, I give this charger a low rating because I think it tries to push some batteries beyond their limits in the name of charging them as quickly or as fully as possible.  One reviewer said it caused his AGM to outgas and another said it burnt out his battery after a few months of trickle charge mode.  If you have the right brand of battery that can handle this charger's output, and your battery isn't damaged, it's probably fine, but the fact that it can damage things and may even damage car electronics in desulfination mode strikes me as very bad design, especially given that desulfination seems like more of a marketing ploy than a valuable feature.  I also don't like that its volt meter reads 0.1 to 0.2V under actual voltage. I have been using a Battery Tender Junior for about 5 years on my motorcycle.  I always plug in the bike and it works great.I recently purchased the Battery Tender Plus to use on my Duramax truck (2 batteries).  It seems to work great so far.  I expect long life of the unit and the batteries just as I have in the past using this line of Battery Tenders.I give it 4 instead of 5 stars only because of the short length of cable they give you.  The Junior's cables are so long that I can run that thing clear across the room.  The Plus' cables are so short that I had to splice in more cable.  They apparently don't expect you to charge your batteries in-vehicle with the Plus.By the way, the Plus brings my 2 very large batteries in my truck upto full charge in less than 8 hours.  They are new batteries and the truck's charging system works just fine and the truck is even driven almost everyday.  However, there is alot of parasitic draw on the batteries with the remote start / alarm system on overnite.  Combined with the 100 plus degree heat of the desert, the Battery Tender Plus is warranted.Of course I would not expect it to recharge my truck batteries if they were dead.  It is not designed to.  Make sure you look at the specs and know what you need.  I just needed a battery tender - something that would keep my batteries at full charge or restore the bit of charge lost overnite from the parasitic draw of the car alarm / starter.  By spec, the Battery Tender Plus cannot recharge these large batteries from dead.  Again, know what you need.  The tech folks at Deltran can help you with that. I originally purchased the Deltran Battery Tender Jr. (021-0123) to keep the battery on my vehicle charged as it&#8217;s advertised of being capable of doing so on the packaging. This battery tender did not charge the battery on my car within the 72 hour window and turned off (Has a built-in timer). I called Deltran (877-456-7901) and was told by customer service that the Deltran Battery Tender Jr. was too small to use on a car/truck battery and that I should have purchased the Deltran Battery Tender Plus. I eventually purchased the Deltran Battery Tender Plus (021-0128) and the Deltran 12.5 ft. extension lead (DBT081-0148-12). The Deltran Battery Tender Jr. works fine on my walk behind lawn mower with electric start and should be fine for anything with a small battery. I would suggest that you purchase the Deltran Battery Tender Plus so you can have the option of using it on more equipment. Deltran should change the label on the Deltran Battery Tender Jr. if it&#8217;s not really intended for car/truck batteries. Check out batterytender.com for Deltrans&#8217; complete line. 
I think I would have expected better instructions for a USA made product. However, there is a lot of available information on the internet and at other vendor websites, so the installation is very straightforward, simple even. I like the small profile and display options. You would also think that technology today would burn in the settings so that you do not need to keep the unit energized continuously. I do not drive my truck for weeks and I will not leave something that draws milliamps connected so I have to disconnect this when not in use. That was not clear in anything I read about it. Bought this to replace my old Battery Tender Plus. I have a Yuasa lead acid wet cell battery in my bike, this looks to be a good match for it. The included hook up wiring is good quality, and the unit has a simple to read interface: power on, charging, maintenance mode/trickle charge.Glad that we can purchase a good quality charger for so little money...my BT cost $60.One tip: match the charger to the battery type. Lead acid, AGM, gel, lithium ion, lithium iron phosphate batteries all need specific chargers. Excellent adapter, I'm using it in my solar system, I use it to connect the battery to the charge controller, and as additional value has an integrated fuse holder which prevents any damage to the system, very well designed and built! 
IT WORKS Bought this to allow the use of the std Tender for an outside car, run this from the garage to the driveway, works just the way it is supposed to... It works.  That's all you can ask.  We no longer run into the junk that we have in the front of the garage 
Had a different charger on my ATV and it kept draining and turning my batteries to garbage. I replaced with this Batteries Tender and it is working great. Good buy Followed all the instruction on filling and charging. I'm not new to motorcycle batteries. This battery has already failed in taking a full charge. Not even a year old. At first I thought it was my bike that wasn't charging.....Nope, turns out this battery crapped out. I threw in a 7 year old Drag Specialties battery I had and use this Yuasa as an expensive paperweight. I currently own 6 12 volt models of this charger and have had no issues after numerous years of use.  Recently bought a Honda CT90 which is a 6 volt system.  The only way to keep the battery at full charge over extended periods is a good reliable trickle charger.  I had to go with the best so a new Battery Tender Junior was the ticket. 
Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars Fits Infiniti's 1995 Q45 and 2000 I30. Nissan Maxima too. This part finder amazon uses is not correct. It says this plug dont fit Infiniti. No telling what it will tell you since others were told it fit thier cars and it dont after ordering.Anyway these plugs work well. Listed as "Ultimate performance" on NGK site. Fantastic plugs. This will help you guys find out if this plug works in your car. Ignore Amazons parts finder and go visit NGK site instead, since this finder is clearly wrong and causing problems! Just Google=  "NGK spark plug finder" and the NGK finder will be in the top few links. Hope this helps. I wish there was a guide somewhere that shows you what cars these sunshades fit. I bought this one (Super Jumbo) for my Toyota Camry, hoping it would fit. Well, it did not fit. I had to return it, and order the regular Jumbo sunshade. The regular Jumbo sunshade fits the windshield like a glove. Quality is good, and it folds up to about 14&#34;. So, if you have a 2007-2013 Toyota Camry, DO NOT BUY THIS ONE!!! Order the regular Jumbo size.Amazon, can you please look into getting some sort of reference guide that will show customers the correct vehicle application? This would make buying this product a whole lot easier.CPS 
What you will be getting is Castrol DOT 4 Synthetic oil which you can get at the local auto parts store for half this price.Castrol GT LMA is the old name of the same product. When I called auto part stores for Castrol GT LMA they did not have it because it's the old name they are not familiar with. The picture on Amazon site is not correct. This battery monitor shows the voltage value with .01 precision (or two digits after decimal point). That is far more then enought to tell the battery status. I put it in the car, it automatically switches between "battery status monitoring" and "charging status monitoring". When the engine is stopped, it is in "battery status monitoring mode", when engine is running, it will be in "charging status monitoring" mode. Amazon's price is even bettern then Walmart. Definitely a great value buy. Will recommend this item to my friends.--- Update ---Amazon has updated the new photo for the product. The picture is correct now. I had bought a couple of these many years ago but recently bought a travel trailer so needed 4 more (could only find one of my old ones).  They are now dated for replacement.  After buying these I found them at Walmart for $1.25 less per unit. The Walmart ones were dated a year later than the Amazon ones. 
This makes it SO easy to charge in conjunction with my battery tender.  So far it has fit all my vehicles batteries ( Acura integra, Toyota Tundra, Toyota Pickup ) i use these for aftermarket batteries for 12v power wheels. can charge with a battery tender and fit together nicely This is a factory replacement for a Honda Rincon. Easy to fill and charge, works great. Sealed battery and should last quite some time in conjunction with my Battery Tender Jr.

I have 3 cars and a boat. The boat has 3 batteries. This will accommodate regular car batteries to house batteries for the boat. 
I bought this ice coolant because of other reviews and comments about them. A few people that i know have used this product and it has actually did cool their engines down a bit. I didnt believe them much until i tried it. Royal Purple Ice coolent does WORK!! just few degrees lower helps a lot in engine performance every little bit helps! I bought this on advice from a blog post I had read, but I didn't have any noticeable results from it. I inherited an old Yamaha scooter that runs well but the acceleration is a little sluggish, and I hoped this might make some difference. I noticed nothing. Other people might have contamination in their carbs that can be cleared up with this stuff, but it did nothing for me. This is my first K&N filter. I will be putting it to the test to see how it works and possibly buying one for my truck too. I have heard nothing but good about these filters, having many friends with them installed on their trucks and cars. One thing I did notice right out of the box is it has more weight and is much better constructed than the Fram filter it is replacing. I will give it some time and update this review. 
Like is the word and not love.For my 1998 shadow ace vt750c.Requires the original honda spark plug tool due to clearance issues.Improve fuel economy? Nah.Improved performance? Nah.If you find hard enough, their website rated this plugs good to go for 50 000 KM.The denso are better made and packaged. Have a smaller tip and a U groove electrode which can last 30 000KM. But since there is no difference in using a normal and iridium plug for my bike, mileage is more important.Only reason to use this is if your plugs are difficult to get to or you dread spark plug changes. Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. This debate just goes on and on...i don't know which is better. I have RP running in my transfer case and Amsoil in my tranny. Can i tell a difference? NOPE! They both seem to have great specs on paper with Amsoil has a slight edge on the viscosity around 100C degree, other than that, they are pretty much the same. Both are synthetic.  The only difference is RP is actually purple in color and you can get it off of Amazon. Amsoil, you have to buy direct. 
It fits perfect on my riding mower 18.5 hp B&S engine.Phram is a excellent quality replacement oil filter for my mower engine Be sure to check with the Auto or Truck Manufacturer to find the correct SIZE of Oil Filter for your vehicle. Amazon's Parts Locator says that the Motorcraft  FL820S does not fit my 1995 Mercury Grand Marquis, 4.6 Litre V-8 engine. This is incorrect. The fact is that the Motorcraft FL820S is the FORD-recommended filter for my 1995 Mercury engine, and is recommended in almost every application of the Ford /Mercury/Lincoln 4.6 Litre engine size.The Motorcraft FL820S interchanges with the BOSCH 3410, the FRAM TG2, and the K&N; 2010.The Motorcraft FL820S  has over 50 pleats, high flow rate, silicone anti-drainback valve, and steel end caps.Amazon's current low price ($3.69) is an excellent value for a quality oil filter that's MADE IN USA !!My car is driven in heavy traffic, desert temperatures, mountain driving, and trans-desert trips from Phoenix to L.A.The standard FORD Motorcraft Filters performed just as well as the high-dollar types -- and filtered MUCH better than the K&N;, which has a very high flow rate (for racing), but the low 90% efficiency rating of the K&N; makes it a no-no for extended oil changes. I wouldn't run a K&N; oil filter for more than 3,000 miles -- you'd just be stirring up dirty oil and pumping it through the bearings !! :>(For my American V-8 engine, I have found the best value to be the Motorcraft FL820S Oil Filter and Mobil 1 5-W-20 Extended Life (Synthetic) engine oil. The quality of the oil filter allows for filter changing every 5,000 miles, and the engine oil is changed once-a-year, regardless of miles driven.For maximum oil life, be sure your PCV system is working properly -- Remove and wash out the PCV Valve with Carburetor  Cleaner, and check for collapsed and/or damaged PCV hoses. A leaking PCV system will suck un-filtered dirt right into your engine !!1995 Mercury Grand Marquis RS225 HP 4.6 Litre SOHC V-8Modified Air Box w/ K&N; Air FilterBosch Impeller Fuel PumpBosch 19 Lb.

The Battery Tender Junior 12V Charger comes complete with everything needed to charge your 12V battery.  I purchased this model to specifically charge my motorcycle battery and I am pleased to say that the unit works great.  It is a very compact charger and is supplied with several attachments to ensure that your battery is kept in an optimum condition.I made the permanent hard wire attachment to my battery using the color coded leads connected directly to the appropriate positive & negative terminals on the battery. The opposite female end has an end cap which can cover the inlet when not in use. When I know that I will not be hitting the road for an extended period of time, I simply plug the unit in to maintain my existing battery's power supply.Battery Tender makes larger charging units, but this battery charger is great for charging everything from batteries for ATV's and motorcycles to scooters and lawn mowers. Because of it's very discreet size it does not take up any needed space. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to protect their battery investment and do not want to compromise space and versatility. This battery is by far the best performance battery you can put in your vehicle.  As we all know the battery that comes in your car as well as other retail batteries do not perform well, they fail at the worst times...ie. cold weather or extreme hot weather.  The power output on the stock battery is just enough to start your car but in extreme weather it just does not have the oomph.  Especially with the demands of newer tech gadgets being incorporated into vehicles, like Ipad, Smart Phones etc.  But the automakers failed to improve the battery to support the technology. This item far exceeds any in the price range, and you will never need another battery for the life of the car.  I bought one in 2003 for my WRX Wagon and it still works like new.  Now i just installed it into my 2006 WRX Wagon and it does not hesitate to start as it did before.  Retail stores sells this for $200+ and will give you $10 - $15 back for your used battery but that still cannot beat the price you pay on amazon for this item especially with Free shipping. This is a useful device to have in your car but you must understand it's limitations. In many cars, it will not be as accurate as taking a reading directly off your battery, which you can do with this device, if you buy this inexpensive additional adapter:Roadpro 12V Battery Clip-On and Cigarette Lighter AdapterThe reason for this is that in vehicles where you have to turn on the ignition to ACC in order to power the cigarette lighter port, once you do that, the vehicle's electronics are also powered and will draw power. So, you will see a lower reading on this device than if you take a reading directly from the battery with the key out of the ignition. In vehicles where the lighter port is always powered, this device can be more accurately used directly plugged in to that port.However, for taking a reading of your charging circuit with the engine running, this can be used in the lighter port in any vehicle.Note that you can do all of this with any household multimeter however the chances of you having that in the vehicle are slim. Most all multimeters also require a battery in them so even if you store one of those in your vehicle, the chances are high that when you need to use it, the internal battery will be dead.This Equus unit however requires no internal battery (at least I don't think it has one), so you can just throw it in your glovebox indefinitely.Car batteries typically last around 5 years so after about 3.5 years is when you may want to periodically use this device to check the health of your battery. Basically, anything under 12v after the vehicle has been sitting for at least 4 hours is a sign the battery should likely be replaced. Above 12v and the battery is probably fine as long as the vehicle starts up.When a friend or relative asks me to check their battery, the first question I ask them is "Does your cigarette lighter port work all the time, or just when you put the key in the ignition and turn on the car?". If they say it's always on, I know I can pretty adequately test their battery just through the lighter port. If however they say it only turns on when they put their car to ACC, I know I will have to have them open their hood so I can read the battery directly with the Equus.The other good thing about this is that you could leave it plugged in all the time for a constant monitoring of your electrical system voltage while driving and parked.For the price, this device is nice to have if you understand how to use it.If you want a more robust battery tester that can not only give you the voltage, but also the CCA rating (cold cranking amps), I recommend this:SOLAR BA7 100-1200 CCA Electronic Battery and System Tester 
I've been using Purolator since, well, I can't remember NOT using Purolator; I've had cars go 300K+, trucks go 250K+, and my previous motorcycle (Yamaha Royal Star) went 165K before it got rear-ended; my present Royal Star has 155K and still runs like a new one. I have added a Ford Escape and informed the dealer that I'll be supplying the oil and filters - Mobil-1 Advanced Fuel Economy 0W-30(conforms to warranty specifications) and Purolator PureONEs. I'm hoping to make half-a-million with this one... So I bought this to replace my 20 year old, kicked around, same version of this gauge.  I had suspected my old one was not reading properly.  So I got this new one.  I am happy to report that the 20 year old one reads exactly the same as this new one.  So now I have a spare to keep in my other car.  The only thing I don't like about this model vs the old one is my old one had a little release valve. So it holds the needle where the pressure reading was till you press the release.  Very handy.  And it was my fault for not noticing it wasn't there on this new version.  Overall, I couldn't be happier with this product.  If you have a car, and have tires, and want them to last, having the correct tire pressure matters. I put this fluid in my 2004 Hyundai Tiburon against the recommendation of AAMCO transmission service.  I was looking at servicing my transmission and asked if they would flush this fluid into my system.  The guy I talked to tried to tell me that this was a "trick" fluid and that my car would shift very hard and it was not recommended for my car.I went against his word based on the reviews of amazon, recommendations by royal purple, and my own intuition based on product specifications.  After changing my fluid to Royal Purple I can say that this has made a phenomenal difference in my car's shifting.  My car was not as smooth as it is now when I bought it new 95,000 miles ago.  I without a doubt would put it in my car again and will be changing in another 4 quarters in the next 30,000 miles.  My car has always been a little choppy shifting since it is only a 4 speed, but with royal purple I can't even feel it shift.  To think that AAMCO told me it would make my car shift hard infuriates me.I highly recommend this fluid for your vehicle if it meets specifications.Update:For anyone wondering, my transmission is still functioning perfectly fine.  I haven't seen any decrease in shifting since March.  Everything is just as good as when I wrote the review. I took a peak at my fluid a few days ago and it still looks and smells perfect.  I still highly recommend it.Update #2:Still rolling around with this fluid in.  It's been over a year and a half and I drive a lot. The older my car gets the harder I am on it which is exactly what I shouldn't be doing, but it's not a baby anymore.  Still 0 problems even when dropping from 7k rpm. I'm confident my car is going to last forever with RP. 
Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones.

Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. This is one-size-fits-most. It works on the filter for my 2002 Volkswagen Passat, but it's too large to grip the filter on my 1993 Chevrolet S10. It a belt... it fits, it hold and it rotates. There is no noise coming from it.Happy with the fit and performance. 
This worked great for my travel trailer.  It expandes and compresses easily for use and storage.  Would definately recommend to anyone looking. We bought for a travel trailer.  About to buy 2 more.  If you buy two sets and set them both on the inside of the double tires on a travel trailer (on both sides)... it really helps the rocking and movement of the trailer when you are walking around. I bought this to use with my camping trailer. I also use stabilizing jacks and wheel chocks, so the wheel dock really has no use. Seems like it would work well with a boat trailer. Price is good. 
I ordered 2 different chargers to maintain my gate opener's deep cycle battery (a simple 4 output charger with extension cords for charging other deep cycle batteries from amazonBattery Tender 022-0148-DL-WH 12V 4-Bank Battery Management System) and this unit has a far superior charging design.The 4 bank battery tender does a simple fast rate charge then switches to a trickle charge at a constant voltage with 4 outputs.This unit pulses the battery under charge and features 3 operating modes with different current outputs for different sized batteries. The selections are motorcycle which also works well for SLA gel cells or AGM batteries, standard automotive starting battery, deep cycle batttery, and off.What makes the CTEK unit special is that it uses a pulse charge in all modes to attempt to desulphate batteries, while the battery tender does not.  This method of charging has proven successful in restoring lead acid batteries that won't take a charge any more.It comes with a waterproof 12V output cable and a set of clips or rings for permanent installation under the hood of your car.  In addition to the LEDs for indicating the type of battery being charged, a second set is provided for empty, 1/2 full, and maintenance pulse charge mode.There is also a noticable increase in quality between the battery tender and this unit - small details like a water sealed housing and gaskets on the connectors indicate quality in manufacture.For a single 12V lead chemistry battery this is a useful, well made tool. Works as intended, easy to plug in and charge the motorcycle batteries.I double checked with volt meter at the end of charging and was at proper voltage I've had good luck with this charger.  I use it to charge a standard starter battery and two Optima blue top deep cycle batteries on my aluminum bass boat.  The charger has settings for standard, agm, and gel batteries as well as 15amp, 10 amp and 2 amp charging rates.  Adjust the charging rate to the size of the battery being charged.  Charger also displays voltage of battery or percent of charge reading at your option.  Auto shut off and displays a green light when fully charged. All charging is done in my garage.  The charger is stored there as well, out of the elements.  I've had no problems in the two years I've owned it.  Maintain your batteries during times of inactivity by charging at least monthly and they'll start your outboard when it's time to fish.  A very good charger for the money spent. 
This was used with the Battery Tender 800 on a lawn tractor and this cable is used to go from an outlet INSIDE the garage to the battery cable on the lawn tractor. Always AC Delco for my GM vechciles! Nice high amp (current) rating on this. I epoxy it to a 12ah  12 volt gel battery and I can use it as a jumpstarter oremergency power supply for camping or power outages. 
There are no better battery charger/maintainers than Battery Tenders and these wires are essential if you have multiple motorcycles like I do. Just attach it to the battery terminals and plug it into your Battery Tender when you need to. i use these for aftermarket batteries for 12v power wheels. can charge with a battery tender and fit together nicely The Battery Tender Junior 12V Charger comes complete with everything needed to charge your 12V battery.

These are a good accessory to have because the clips are decent quality and the varied colors are helpful in keeping track of all the wires. These are light duty jumpers but will work for occasional use. There are times when the voltmeter needs to be connected and you cannot hold the leads. These are fine for that. these are very nice and flexible the straps are firmly connected.  I foresee many years of service from these covers 
You can't say much about this quick disconnect plug. But one for sure: having it installedcharging your motorcycle is much easier than using those old fashioned alligator clamps.If you also interested in buying a battery maintainer the harness is included in this one:&#34;Black & Decker BM3B 6V and 12V Battery Charger / Maintainer&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051D3MP6/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0You may also like to hear that there is a adapter available from SAE-2-USB plug available:&#34;SAE to USB Adapter - Motorcycle Cell Phone Charger&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007VFFQRE/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1So if you also use a navigation system while riding you can easily charge this on the road. bought this to attach to my car battery, and black and decker BM3B 6V & 12V charger. It plugs in nicely, and charges. A nice charger. Is also smaller than it appears on the picture. So easy to carry and handle.Unfortunately I had to send it back because it just has the standard clamps to charge.There were no &#34;Quick Disconnect Extension&#34; option to easy plug-n-charge a motorcycle.So I bought the &#34;Black & Decker BM3B 6V and 12V Battery Charger / Maintainer&#34;:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051D3MP6/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0 
I own 4 Battery Tenders, one each for my rarely driven Corvette, my wife's BMW Convertible (both driven less than 2K mi per year and stored for 4 months per year), my standby generator, and my lawn tractor.  The BMW's battery is now 8 years old, the Corvettes is 5 years old, the generators is 3 and the tractor is only a year old.  Based on the BMW, I expect to get a lot more life from the other batteries to. It works but the actuator in my 14 year old truck is worn. I had two Delco batteries die after  four year period of five years in my low mileage Corvette.The battery fits perfect and the red top looks great in my red Corvette.The car turns over faster than it ever did,even after sitting for a few weeks.I hope that it lasts more than a few years.If it does not,I will add to the review. 
bought this to attach to my car battery, and black and decker BM3B 6V & 12V charger. It plugs in nicely, and charges. For the last 8 or 10 years I have replace the stock OEM air filters with K&Ns.  Better MPG and better power.  When you consider that you'll be replacing the OEM filters every 10,000 miles or so the K&N is actually cheaper in the long run! I see a lot of negative reviews for this charger that I think are partially due to Amazon's incorrect description and the fact that most people don't know what size or type of charger they need. (including myself)I am a practicing Electronic engineer with more than 20yrs experience. I did not know much about battery chargers until recently researching what a good battery charger should do.1) this charger only delivers a max of 1.5A. This means if you try to charge a discharged auto battery (48AH) it will take a long long time. This charger does work great for topping off a car battery at 70% (12.4V).2) The instructions included clearly state the charger will automatically shut-off after 12 hours of charging. The charger will restart and continue charging if you unplug and then plug the charger in again. Best to get a higher capacity charger.3) This charger does have a float mode sort of. Actually it shuts off the charging current and monitors battery voltage. When the battery voltage drops low enough the charger cycles on to top it off and then shuts off again.MY SUMMARY 1st:I like this charger and think it does a good job for the PRICE. Gold box special was $15.20 + tax. (I would definitely buy it at the regular price for $3$)It's basically automatic. Don't have to set the voltage and it won't damage anything if you reverse the clips accidently. Compact size and reasonable quality clamps.This charger does what it is designed for. That is charge small batteries and top off larger automotive batteries. This is an excellent maintenance charger for all batteries to keep them fully charged when not in use. (My opinion)Personally I would not leave any charger connected to my battery for more than 24 hours. Now I use a cheap mechanical timer that is set to turn on for 1 hour every 24 hours. I would prefer a timer that I can set to turn on twice a week for a few hours.The charger is small feels solidly built with heavy plastic. It gets very warm aftercharging at 1.5A but not warm enough to be concerned. (no cooling fan)I gave this charger 5 stars because PRICE and performance is very good. Build quality is good as well.AMAZON DESCRIPTION (Poor): is incorrect in that this charger is not intended to be used to charge a LOW (discharged) car battery. The chart in the DESCRIPTION that shows the charging times is different than the manual.. The included MANUAL has a chart that states this charger should only be used as a "top off" or maintenance charger for auto batteries. In addition the charger in charging mode automatically shuts off after 12 hours of charging. (A good safety feature in my opinion.)Charging details:I discharged a car/truck jump start battery pack to 12.45V or approx 75% charge.(Typical full charge is 12.65V to 12.7V. To discharge the battery I used a battery/alternator tester. I have a voltmeter attached to charger and a current meter in series with battery and battery charger negative terminal.1) At the start of the charge, the charge current was 0.78A and then jumped to 1.52A in a few minutes.2) After 1 hour the charge current is 1.47A. Charge voltage is 13.0V.3) After 2 hours the charge current is 1.48A. Charge voltage is 13.25V.4) After 3 hours the charge current is 1.43A. Charge voltage is 13.46V.5) After 4 hours the charge current is 1.40A. Charge voltage is 13.82V.Note: that the charge current is decreasing as the battery is approaching full charge. This design feature will prevent overheating and extend the life of your battery.6) After 5 hours the charge current is 0.68A. Charge voltage is 14.71V.7) After 5.5 hours the charge current is 0.35A. Charge voltage is 14.67V.8) After 6 hours the charge current is 0.29A. Charge voltage is 14.73V.9) After 6.5 hours the charge current is 0.24A. Charge voltage is 14.72V.10) After 8.5 hours the charge current is 0.20A. Charge voltage is 14.73V.11) After 10.5 hours the charge current is 0.15A. Charge voltage is 14.71V.12) After 11.5 hours the charge is COMPLETE and the charge current has dropped to 0.0A. BATTERY voltage is 13.55V and declining. Charger is in the monitor mode. In monitor mode the charger AC power is 3W measured with a Belkin Watt meter.Almost 12 hours seems like a long time to charge a battery and this isn't even a full capacity car battery. But, it did a good job of gently charging the battery especially when it was near full charge. The important thing to me is the charging current declined as the battery neared full charge. This prevents overcharging and truly tops off the battery to maximum capacity.I tested the battery the next day with a battery tester and it passed well within the "good battery" full charge limits. The results were much better than the charger that came with the battery pack where it tested NEAR "weak".Very happy with the purchase. I would buy this exact model again. Should there be any problem(s) in the future I will update this review.Ships from and sold by Amazon. 
I bought this item for the battery tender .  Hook it up to the battery terminals and plug it in the battery tender. connected two of these cables to charge my battery on my truck / battery charger unit is in garage works perfect. I originally purchased the Deltran Battery Tender Jr. (021-0123) to keep the battery on my vehicle charged as it&#8217;s advertised of being capable of doing so on the packaging. This battery tender did not charge the battery on my car within the 72 hour window and turned off (Has a built-in timer). I called Deltran (877-456-7901) and was told by customer service that the Deltran Battery Tender Jr. was too small to use on a car/truck battery and that I should have purchased the Deltran Battery Tender Plus. I eventually purchased the Deltran Battery Tender Plus (021-0128) and the Deltran 12.5 ft. extension lead (DBT081-0148-12). The Deltran Battery Tender Jr. works fine on my walk behind lawn mower with electric start and should be fine for anything with a small battery. I would suggest that you purchase the Deltran Battery Tender Plus so you can have the option of using it on more equipment. Deltran should change the label on the Deltran Battery Tender Jr. if it&#8217;s not really intended for car/truck batteries. Check out batterytender.com for Deltrans&#8217; complete line. 
This is a very nice charger for many batteries, BUT it states AGM (not good for many). An AGM 12VDC VMAX, or Optima type RV or marine battery requires a special charger that will deliver 25-35 Amps, not 8. This is for a very small AGM battery. This cost over $120 and I will use it for regular flooded lead batteries but must buy another for AGM or Gel batteries for my RV. A specialty battery requires a specialty charger, I found out. I do recommend this, would buy again, and I hope this helps. I did a bit of research before purchasing this product. If you want a quick charge, I have read that your battery won't last as long. For battery life, the ideal charge is low amerage.  I appreciate that this charger provides a low amp charge to the battery. I had an older battery charger that I believe prematurely destroyed one of my 12v batteries, so I did my best to find the best value replacement. As a matter of fact, the way I saw the older charger behaving (according to my digital multimeter), I was concerned that it could cause the battery to explode or start a fire. I decided to get a new one. I looked at all of the battery chargers I could find on Amazon and other sites. Eventually, I settled on this particular model for these reasons:1. Provides a low amperage charge, which is supposed to help prolong battery life.2. Desulphination mode, which is supposed to help prolong battery life.3. Safety shutoff features, so that it doesn't overcharge the battery.4. Reads the battery polarity and illuminates a red light if you have it reversed.5. Excellent review on Amazon and other sites that sell battery chargers.I've only been using the battery minder for a couple of months, but I think it is working well. The recharges and maintenance modes seem appropriate. The batteries seem to last a long time after I charge them. This product seems to be living up to the claims and ratings. I am impressed. I originally purchased the Deltran Battery Tender Jr. (021-0123) to keep the battery on my vehicle charged as it&#8217;s advertised of being capable of doing so on the packaging.

This four station battery tender is just as simple to use as the single units.  One simply plugs the unit in and connects the battery via alligator clips or a connection affixed to the battery. Its a simple task to tell what state the battery is in.  If amber the battery is deep charging, if green range it is 80 to 100% charged.  After the battery is charged, leaving in connected will put the unit in float mode, which will keep the battery "topped off" without damaging it.  My only concern is the housing is plastic and all of my single units are metal.  It does have mounting holes so it can be wall mounted or affixed more securely to a shelf, etc.  Like the single units, total time from opening the box to charging is about 2 minutes.By the way, instructions for deciphering the state of the amber and green lights are not in the instruction manual but on the right side of the unit.I also ordered the 12 foot extension cables, a good call if you need to have your batteries more than about four feet from the unit. Needed something to plug into my 25&#34; camping travel trailer to monitor my 2, 6-volt (connected in series to make one large long lasting 12v battery) batteries .... This thing worked PERFECT! When you turn anything on it register the drop in voltage and just seems to show the correct battery level perfectly at all times. It drops down to yellow when you kick on the heater and what not but that just means it is showing you where the levels are at with that kind of load. Makes monitoring my batteries Simple As Can Be! I ordered 2 different chargers to maintain my gate opener's deep cycle battery (a simple 4 output charger with extension cords for charging other deep cycle batteries from amazonBattery Tender 022-0148-DL-WH 12V 4-Bank Battery Management System) and this unit has a far superior charging design.The 4 bank battery tender does a simple fast rate charge then switches to a trickle charge at a constant voltage with 4 outputs.This unit pulses the battery under charge and features 3 operating modes with different current outputs for different sized batteries. The selections are motorcycle which also works well for SLA gel cells or AGM batteries, standard automotive starting battery, deep cycle batttery, and off.What makes the CTEK unit special is that it uses a pulse charge in all modes to attempt to desulphate batteries, while the battery tender does not.  This method of charging has proven successful in restoring lead acid batteries that won't take a charge any more.It comes with a waterproof 12V output cable and a set of clips or rings for permanent installation under the hood of your car.  In addition to the LEDs for indicating the type of battery being charged, a second set is provided for empty, 1/2 full, and maintenance pulse charge mode.There is also a noticable increase in quality between the battery tender and this unit - small details like a water sealed housing and gaskets on the connectors indicate quality in manufacture.For a single 12V lead chemistry battery this is a useful, well made tool. 
I did not install yet.  It looks like it will work fine.  I'll let you know when I am done.Update is that it works as intended! Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.  The pickle fork is the last resort for me, as it will damage the balljoint boot.I prefer to use the Snap On balljoint remover.  If that one cannot fit, then I will try this tool.  If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork. Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars 
I purchased this to charge and Maintain batteries but the unit I got does not maintain at all and the cooling fan never operates no matter what amp charge setting. Connected to a car battery I start charging and it shows battery is at 70% which is nice and after full charge at 100% the charger goes into Charge/Maintain mode but that's where it stops working like others have reported...came back to the battery after two days and the battery isn't charged and so I unplug the charger and plug it back in and it shows battery at 52%. The battery is connected to 4 10 watt LED lights that come on after dark for 6 hours so I expected this charger to start charging when the battery is down but that is not the case like how my last battery charger/maintainer worked. It only seems to charge and not maintain so It's being returned to Amazon.Don't trust it to keep a battery maintain.Update. Amazon replace charger and was quick about it...but the new charger arrived DOA and now on the way back to Amazon for refund. Done with this brand. I have several Classic cars, a motorcycle battery, and two boat batteries that I need to keep charged, so I purchased the Battery Tender 4-Bank Battery Management System to help me keep the batteries at the optimum charge level over long periods of non-use.I have had several batteries go bad from overcharging on regular battery chargers, and from sulphating when not using or charging them for extended periods.  I decided to get the Deltran 4-Bank system to extend the useful life of my batteries  and hopefully, it will pay for itself in prolonged battery life for all of my different battery applications. We have cars with full of electronic gadgets so they consume significant electricity, even when car is being driven. Almost every week we get no start due to weak battery. I have an external car battery charger (old). It is bulky to setup to charge cars overnight. Also it does not have any detection, so the battery can be continuously overcharged, which will eventually damage the battery (as multiple battery experts tell me). Never learned our lesson as we had 3 quality batteries purchased and replaced - each within 2 years.After reading all the great reviews, I bought one of these on-board charger and installed in one of the car that frequently dies (even with new battery). Now I can just plug in to the wall when car is parked each night, and unplug in the morning before the commute. No need to check if charging is complete if not driven for days! Also it will reduce the risk of not able to start the car to almost none.I will be buying another one for our other electronic gadgets-heavy car...  The next convenient thing is to find a good retractable power cords that can either be installed in the car with the on-board charger, or to the outlets for which the charger will be tapping power from. 
I need this converter (110V to 12V) for powering a electric cooler (Koolatron P25).I picked this one as it was less pricey like some others (>$40!) and the reviews were good.The item works as advertised. Of course it gets warm, nothing to get excited about. I had a splitter attached to it and powered a electric fan in addition. I noticed only a very small drop in the fan speed once the cooler was attached.I will need another one, I am tempted to try the Black & Decker / Vector CV6B Travel Mate which outputs 6 Amps. Only 1 Amp more, am not sure how big the difference would be. It costs $3 more. Schumacher SEM-1562A 1.5 Amp Speed Charge MaintainerWell worth the price...does exactly what it is suppose to do.(Update) After using this charger less than 5 mos. to maintain my R.V., which is seldom driven, I have found that, because of the charger failing to cycle back to the charge mode properly, the battery that it was hooked to was stone dead. Now, I'll do some research to find out the annoying process of returning the charger for warranty.(Update) I have contacted the manufacturer, Schumacher, concerning the failure of this charger but after 3 weeks, have received no response and it doesn't look like I am going to. So, I guess I'll just take the loss of making a bad choice and trash it. BTW, I am using two Chicago Electric on Board chargers, one on my Jeep and the other on my Mercury Sable. Both are giving very good service and are less expensive than the Schumacher or the Battery Tender. I love the gripped exterior of the filter. I am getting the same performance as I did with the previous Honda filter at a fraction of the price. 
I have a bunch of these in various models, 6v, 12v, and this one the multi-mode 12v. They really do a good job.Reasons I don't give a 5 star:I have had 3 of them go belly up. One the company replaced free, I have not bothered on the other two yet.The supplied "hard wired" harness has a inappropriately short cord before the connector.(Edit: the hardwired lugs to attach to the battery are also not appropriate many cars especially older ones as the hole is about right for a motorcycle battery. Making my own harnesses for making the unit hard-wired to the battery was a bit time consuming but they turn out well, just FYI don't expect to just bolt it on your standard battery clamp. Its way too small. The cig lighter, if your car has a permanently connected one is probably easier but new cars sometimes control this with key. Oh, two more comments - 1. It doesn't' come with a cig lighter attachment, its optional and 2. the optional hard wire hookup DOES have larger lugs on it)If you are wiring into a motorcycle it might just be long enough, but for my car applications I have always had to make my own harness extensions which is time consuming to get the wires all soldered, shrink wrapped.It does come with a nice little case.Having separate small battery mode and AGM mode is nice, although the paperwork on the basic ones mentioned they would charge AGM. AGM just takes a slower charge rate than lead/acid apparently as it heats up. I am not sure what they claim the AGM mode is, but nice to have it. Real nice battery tender tail which comes with maxi-fuse and standard tender coupling.As you may see from the current amazon product picture, the battery connectors are circular and enclosed so I chose to snip off about 30% off them (to make the connectors 'C' shaped) so I could slot them onto the battery bolts which taking them completely out. I just used a pair of wire cutters - snip, snip - which took two seconds.And once connected to the battery, the tail worked fine with my existing tender. Very happy with product and price. I use this cable with my solar kit and am very happy with the durable construction. I use a small solar panel to charge up my deep cell battery, and then attach these clamps to the positive and negative posts. Voila; an instant DC power socket.I also use these clamps on my car battery when I want to get the most watt power for electronic devices. When paired with a small USB inverter, I can get the full 140 watts from it, instead of the 100 watts available through my cigarette lighter.The cables are of middle thickness, but are smooth and well constructed. The clamps are secure when attached to battery posts, and easy to remove. The length is a bit on the spare side, but I understand that these cables cannot be too long and still provide useful electrical  juice. I'm pleased with this purchase, and plan to order a second one to live inside my car. 
connected two of these cables to charge my battery on my truck / battery charger unit is in garage works perfect. This is the Cadillac of battery chargers.  I put my Miata on the charger each winter.  Doesn't overcharge the battery, doesn't dry out the cells, just works perfectly.  It will even charge up a dead battery if you give it a few days.  At this low amperage it isn't ideal for this, but it will work.This is about $50.  A new battery is about $100.  Leaving a battery discharging or not charging for a long time (months) kills the battery.  Do the math and you see you can't afford not to have one. I see a lot of negative reviews for this charger that I think are partially due to Amazon's incorrect description and the fact that most people don't know what size or type of charger they need. (including myself)I am a practicing Electronic engineer with more than 20yrs experience. I did not know much about battery chargers until recently researching what a good battery charger should do.1) this charger only delivers a max of 1.5A. This means if you try to charge a discharged auto battery (48AH) it will take a long long time. This charger does work great for topping off a car battery at 70% (12.4V).2) The instructions included clearly state the charger will automatically shut-off after 12 hours of charging. The charger will restart and continue charging if you unplug and then plug the charger in again. Best to get a higher capacity charger.3) This charger does have a float mode sort of. Actually it shuts off the charging current and monitors battery voltage. When the battery voltage drops low enough the charger cycles on to top it off and then shuts off again.MY SUMMARY 1st:I like this charger and think it does a good job for the PRICE. Gold box special was $15.20 + tax. (I would definitely buy it at the regular price for $3$)It's basically automatic. Don't have to set the voltage and it won't damage anything if you reverse the clips accidently. Compact size and reasonable quality clamps.This charger does what it is designed for. That is charge small batteries and top off larger automotive batteries. This is an excellent maintenance charger for all batteries to keep them fully charged when not in use.

Use it to tend mower and tractor batteries.  Works well.  Haven't used it on larger batteries.  Bought this to replace another brand that failed right out of the package.  No quality issues with this one. No issues, just as described. Currently have owned 3 Battery Tender 800 chargers for over a year with no problems.  Use the chargers on two tractors and jet ski. This was used with the Battery Tender 800 on a lawn tractor and this cable is used to go from an outlet INSIDE the garage to the battery cable on the lawn tractor. 
The Battery Tender Junior 12V Charger comes complete with everything needed to charge your 12V battery.  I purchased this model to specifically charge my motorcycle battery and I am pleased to say that the unit works great.  It is a very compact charger and is supplied with several attachments to ensure that your battery is kept in an optimum condition.I made the permanent hard wire attachment to my battery using the color coded leads connected directly to the appropriate positive & negative terminals on the battery. The opposite female end has an end cap which can cover the inlet when not in use. When I know that I will not be hitting the road for an extended period of time, I simply plug the unit in to maintain my existing battery's power supply.Battery Tender makes larger charging units, but this battery charger is great for charging everything from batteries for ATV's and motorcycles to scooters and lawn mowers. Because of it's very discreet size it does not take up any needed space. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to protect their battery investment and do not want to compromise space and versatility. I got a power plug to power plug style &#34;jumper&#34; device for my daughter, in case the 12V battery on her Prius dies.  Since the Prius doesn't use the 12V battery to start the motor, she doesn't need real jumper cables.  However, it's a keyless ignition, so she will not be able to jump power plug to power plug.  The battery on the Prius is has small terminals, so these are a nice size and should do the job of getting power from someone else's light to her battery. Mine arrived perfect, simple to open packaging, and works as expected. Easy to use and comes with clamps and permanently installed wires if desired. This does not delufate, nor start a car, and at low amps would take weeks to recharge a drained battery, deep-cycle AGM or Gel type, as this is a very low amp trickler/float charger. Most AGM's require a special 3-4 staged 10-30 amp charger. Once the battery is charged this will do its job of tending/maintaining a full charge on any 12 volt DC lead-acid battery. I also have two Battery MINDers for our RV and towed that are garaged over the winter and a Tender plus for a truck. You need close access to an outlet or a properly sized extension cord and you can leave the battery attached, in the vehicle. I recommend this, would buy again, and hope this helps someone. 
I originally purchased the Deltran Battery Tender Jr. (021-0123) to keep the battery on my vehicle charged as it&#8217;s advertised of being capable of doing so on the packaging. This battery tender did not charge the battery on my car within the 72 hour window and turned off (Has a built-in timer). I called Deltran (877-456-7901) and was told by customer service that the Deltran Battery Tender Jr. was too small to use on a car/truck battery and that I should have purchased the Deltran Battery Tender Plus. I eventually purchased the Deltran Battery Tender Plus (021-0128) and the Deltran 12.5 ft. extension lead (DBT081-0148-12). The Deltran Battery Tender Jr. works fine on my walk behind lawn mower with electric start and should be fine for anything with a small battery. I would suggest that you purchase the Deltran Battery Tender Plus so you can have the option of using it on more equipment. Deltran should change the label on the Deltran Battery Tender Jr. if it&#8217;s not really intended for car/truck batteries. Check out batterytender.com for Deltrans&#8217; complete line.

The items works great no issues with overheating or overcharging would recommend to others with RV batteries and mowers. 
Sure you can use a C clamp or a adjustable wrench but this isn't very expensive and looks to be of reasonable construction. My only issue is I have everything to install brakes but I've been waiting for almost 3 weeks for a floor jack to ship and I'll be damned if I'm breaking out the jack out of my trunk when quality floor jack is on order. Ok finally used this tool and all I can say is Perfect! Works just as it should, I tightened in small slow increments and let the piston settle all the way back. Made adding the pads a dream, now if there was a way to keep the freak'n pads in place till you slide the caliper back in place ! lol First of all, this was shipped in its original sales box all taped up, and that is it.  Was shocked to see the poor excuse of shipping method, but I guess you really cannot break this thing simply by shipping it.Installed on a 7K lb travel trailer, works pretty good, but did not elliminate all the sway.  Part of it is because I am towing with a large SUV that is really a little small framed for towing this size camper, even though the RV Dealers will say it is a perfect fit as does the tow vehicle manujfacturer.Sold the SUV and bought a big boy truck to tow with, and what a difference.  I don't even need this anymore, as the bigger tow vehicle makes all the difference.BTW, DO NOT back up with this connected to the tow vehicle and trailer, you will bend it faster that you installed it. i bought these because passengers needed something to hang on while getting in my jeep and my 300LBS friend used it and it held up pretty good i was surprised there is one problem and thats for the back its hard to use it properly because the way its sits all the way to the back of the roll cage. second the back ones to fit when the soft top is on .. they only work with the hard top on.over all its a solid product and useable just not for the back  and thats why i gave it 4 stars 
PROS:Tied to my Travel Trailer Battery to connect to my Solar Panel Charger.Quick Connect/Disconnect means you only mess with the terminals once, when you put this on the battery.Keyed so you don't create a short (Though be CAREFUL to orient it correctly on the battery posts).CONS: None. A car we store for the winter in an un-heated garagehas the battery go dead with-in a month .And a couple of times the parasitic drain ruined a cell/battery.So we bought a Battery Tender for that issue.One doesn't need to be versed about an automobileor a BT to use one and solve a variety of problems.It's a worry free ~ wonderful product that completely monitors itself.You can leave it hooked up for weeks or months etc.All though you ought to check on it every once in a while.The cab light in our truck was left on overnight & wouldn't startthe BT restored it enough with-in two hours to turn the motor over.A battery must have at least 3 volts left or the BT won't initiate chargingThen your down to jumping it, if the battery isn't yet ruined.The cords of the Battery Tender Plus are ~Electric cord (box to outlet) 6 ft 2"longCable that clips to a battery (with clips attached - box to battery) 7 ftGiving a possible continual length of over 13 ft.If that's not long enough, the 25 ft BT extension is economicaland our experience is that the BT is just as effective weather the ex is used or not.Footnote: A warning in the instructions say ~ quote1. "If the positive battery post is connected to the vehicle chassis,then the vehicle has a positive ground system.2. If the negative battery post is connected to the vehicle chassisthen the vehicle has a negative ground system.(Most systems are negative)3. For negative ground systems connect the positive alligator clip to the positive battery post.4. Then connect the negative alligator clip to the vehicle chassis."Then it goes on to state several areas NOT to connect to.This language has always worried me what exactly was the right thing to do here.So I phoned Deltran Corp and asked.They said they have to state that to protect themselves butthat it's fine to hook both clips to the two appropriate terminals of the battery.I must say here that the folks at Deltran are very accessible ~ knowledgeable ~and offered comparison information between the BT Jr verses the BT plus ~ cheerfully.I was impressed with their customer service. The Battery Tender Alligator clips allow me to charge a battery without having to install the ring type terminals on the positive and negative posts.  I can also charge a battery without having to remove it from a vehicle or removing the cables from the battery.  A very handy item to use with my Deltran 4-bank charger. 
I ordered 2 different chargers to maintain my gate opener's deep cycle battery (a simple 4 output charger with extension cords for charging other deep cycle batteries from amazonBattery Tender 022-0148-DL-WH 12V 4-Bank Battery Management System) and this unit has a far superior charging design.The 4 bank battery tender does a simple fast rate charge then switches to a trickle charge at a constant voltage with 4 outputs.This unit pulses the battery under charge and features 3 operating modes with different current outputs for different sized batteries. The selections are motorcycle which also works well for SLA gel cells or AGM batteries, standard automotive starting battery, deep cycle batttery, and off.What makes the CTEK unit special is that it uses a pulse charge in all modes to attempt to desulphate batteries, while the battery tender does not.  This method of charging has proven successful in restoring lead acid batteries that won't take a charge any more.It comes with a waterproof 12V output cable and a set of clips or rings for permanent installation under the hood of your car.  In addition to the LEDs for indicating the type of battery being charged, a second set is provided for empty, 1/2 full, and maintenance pulse charge mode.There is also a noticable increase in quality between the battery tender and this unit - small details like a water sealed housing and gaskets on the connectors indicate quality in manufacture.For a single 12V lead chemistry battery this is a useful, well made tool. The Battery Tender Alligator clips allow me to charge a battery without having to install the ring type terminals on the positive and negative posts.  I can also charge a battery without having to remove it from a vehicle or removing the cables from the battery.  A very handy item to use with my Deltran 4-bank charger. i use these for aftermarket batteries for 12v power wheels. can charge with a battery tender and fit together nicely 
How do you rate these?  They do exactly what they are supposed to do.  What more can I say.  It don't stink no more?!  LOL I required an ammonia-free window cleaner for my tinted windows. This does the job quite nicely. It isn't how well it does, rather how safely it does it. Not much to say, it either works or it doesn't.... this product is not rocket science and does what it claims. 
How can one really rate it, as it is used for protection and no idae how long it should last, yet is was as listed so I give it the benifit ogf the doubt... Rated the best &#34;value&#34; filter on the market by independent testers that tested each filter on the market by using them and then cutting the filters open to see how they held up under actual use.  They then rated the filters on how well they fared and also how well they were made. I don't know how many of you remember the definitions of accuracy and precision from high school chemistry, but this product is both! I compared it to two other inaccurate tire gauges and this one was the only consistently accurate gauge after comparing at the dealership. Highly recommended considering its price and durability. 
I now have 5 Battery Tender Plus chargers. Ever since I started keeping my little used batteries on a Battery Tender, I have not had a battery failure.When I first bought my Generator (over 15 years ago) the starter batteries would only last a couple years because the Generator was used so infrequently, sometimes not for a couple years. Since then, I now leave a Battery Tender connected and also start the Generator once a year. The current battery in my Generator has now been in for almost 10 years!I had to replace the battery recently (2 years ago) in my Polaris 800 ATV because it kept going dead (after couple months) because I didn't keep it on a charger (it sits in a shed with no electricity). I didn't think it would be a problem because I use the ATV 4-5 times a year. But modern AGM and Freedom Batteries cannot tolerate repeated deep discharges. I knew better but was too lazy to keep pulling the battery out or running a very long extension cord to the shed. Now I remove the battery and keep it connected to a Battery Tender.I could site many more instances where I am now getting triple or even greater life from equipment or vehicle batteries by keeping them connected to a Battery Tender Plus. Given that even a small ATV battery costs upwards of $60, the cost of a Battery Tender will pay for itself in a few years.And Battery Tenders have a 10 year warranty, unheard of for any battery charger. I bought this mainly for topping off 4 12v scooter batteries before I chain them for a 48v scooter. I also use it to maintain one 12v for an alarm. I had a so-called maintainer that cost as much as this charger but only was .75 amp. It burned up trying to top off some 12v batteries. With this unit you can bring a battery to full charge in about 12 hours.I am very pleased with this charger/maintainer and would recommend it. Schumacher is a very old company. I had one of their chargers over forty years ago. I purchased this item for a lawn tractor to keep the battery up to charge when not in use. I have a different model Battery Tender I use on my motorcycle. These are the best 'trickle' chargers and 'battery-minders' on the market. 
This four station battery tender is just as simple to use as the single units.  One simply plugs the unit in and connects the battery via alligator clips or a connection affixed to the battery. Its a simple task to tell what state the battery is in.  If amber the battery is deep charging, if green range it is 80 to 100% charged.  After the battery is charged, leaving in connected will put the unit in float mode, which will keep the battery "topped off" without damaging it.  My only concern is the housing is plastic and all of my single units are metal.  It does have mounting holes so it can be wall mounted or affixed more securely to a shelf, etc.  Like the single units, total time from opening the box to charging is about 2 minutes.By the way, instructions for deciphering the state of the amber and green lights are not in the instruction manual but on the right side of the unit.I also ordered the 12 foot extension cables, a good call if you need to have your batteries more than about four feet from the unit. This is a great little charger, especially for the price.  Simple hookup with the ring terminals on my motorcycle and the connector stays zip-tied to the subframe just below the seat.  Once connected the LED on the charger gives me status information at a glance so I can always tell when the battery is charging or sitting there maintaining a full charge. I have this connected to my car's battery (located in the trunk) 24/7/365.  This tender turns off when battery reaches optimal charge.  In addition, the tender has a connector so you can connect it to your battery with one easy plug.  The tender is extremely convenient and with its led light lets you know if the battery is charged or being charged.  When it's time to drive I simply unplug tender and off I go.  I highly recommend this item. 
I ordered 2 different chargers to maintain my gate opener's deep cycle battery (a simple 4 output charger with extension cords for charging other deep cycle batteries from amazonBattery Tender 022-0148-DL-WH 12V 4-Bank Battery Management System) and this unit has a far superior charging design.The 4 bank battery tender does a simple fast rate charge then switches to a trickle charge at a constant voltage with 4 outputs.This unit pulses the battery under charge and features 3 operating modes with different current outputs for different sized batteries.

I've had good luck with this charger.  I use it to charge a standard starter battery and two Optima blue top deep cycle batteries on my aluminum bass boat.  The charger has settings for standard, agm, and gel batteries as well as 15amp, 10 amp and 2 amp charging rates.  Adjust the charging rate to the size of the battery being charged.  Charger also displays voltage of battery or percent of charge reading at your option.  Auto shut off and displays a green light when fully charged. All charging is done in my garage.  The charger is stored there as well, out of the elements.  I've had no problems in the two years I've owned it.  Maintain your batteries during times of inactivity by charging at least monthly and they'll start your outboard when it's time to fish.  A very good charger for the money spent. I see a lot of negative reviews for this charger that I think are partially due to Amazon's incorrect description and the fact that most people don't know what size or type of charger they need. (including myself)I am a practicing Electronic engineer with more than 20yrs experience. I did not know much about battery chargers until recently researching what a good battery charger should do.1) this charger only delivers a max of 1.5A. This means if you try to charge a discharged auto battery (48AH) it will take a long long time. This charger does work great for topping off a car battery at 70% (12.4V).2) The instructions included clearly state the charger will automatically shut-off after 12 hours of charging. The charger will restart and continue charging if you unplug and then plug the charger in again. Best to get a higher capacity charger.3) This charger does have a float mode sort of. Actually it shuts off the charging current and monitors battery voltage. When the battery voltage drops low enough the charger cycles on to top it off and then shuts off again.MY SUMMARY 1st:I like this charger and think it does a good job for the PRICE. Gold box special was $15.20 + tax. (I would definitely buy it at the regular price for $3$)It's basically automatic. Don't have to set the voltage and it won't damage anything if you reverse the clips accidently. Compact size and reasonable quality clamps.This charger does what it is designed for. That is charge small batteries and top off larger automotive batteries. This is an excellent maintenance charger for all batteries to keep them fully charged when not in use. (My opinion)Personally I would not leave any charger connected to my battery for more than 24 hours. Now I use a cheap mechanical timer that is set to turn on for 1 hour every 24 hours. I would prefer a timer that I can set to turn on twice a week for a few hours.The charger is small feels solidly built with heavy plastic. It gets very warm aftercharging at 1.5A but not warm enough to be concerned. (no cooling fan)I gave this charger 5 stars because PRICE and performance is very good. Build quality is good as well.AMAZON DESCRIPTION (Poor): is incorrect in that this charger is not intended to be used to charge a LOW (discharged) car battery. The chart in the DESCRIPTION that shows the charging times is different than the manual.. The included MANUAL has a chart that states this charger should only be used as a "top off" or maintenance charger for auto batteries. In addition the charger in charging mode automatically shuts off after 12 hours of charging. (A good safety feature in my opinion.)Charging details:I discharged a car/truck jump start battery pack to 12.45V or approx 75% charge.(Typical full charge is 12.65V to 12.7V. To discharge the battery I used a battery/alternator tester. I have a voltmeter attached to charger and a current meter in series with battery and battery charger negative terminal.1) At the start of the charge, the charge current was 0.78A and then jumped to 1.52A in a few minutes.2) After 1 hour the charge current is 1.47A. Charge voltage is 13.0V.3) After 2 hours the charge current is 1.48A. Charge voltage is 13.25V.4) After 3 hours the charge current is 1.43A. Charge voltage is 13.46V.5) After 4 hours the charge current is 1.40A. Charge voltage is 13.82V.Note: that the charge current is decreasing as the battery is approaching full charge. This design feature will prevent overheating and extend the life of your battery.6) After 5 hours the charge current is 0.68A. Charge voltage is 14.71V.7) After 5.5 hours the charge current is 0.35A. Charge voltage is 14.67V.8) After 6 hours the charge current is 0.29A. Charge voltage is 14.73V.9) After 6.5 hours the charge current is 0.24A. Charge voltage is 14.72V.10) After 8.5 hours the charge current is 0.20A. Charge voltage is 14.73V.11) After 10.5 hours the charge current is 0.15A. Charge voltage is 14.71V.12) After 11.5 hours the charge is COMPLETE and the charge current has dropped to 0.0A. BATTERY voltage is 13.55V and declining. Charger is in the monitor mode. In monitor mode the charger AC power is 3W measured with a Belkin Watt meter.Almost 12 hours seems like a long time to charge a battery and this isn't even a full capacity car battery. But, it did a good job of gently charging the battery especially when it was near full charge. The important thing to me is the charging current declined as the battery neared full charge. This prevents overcharging and truly tops off the battery to maximum capacity.I tested the battery the next day with a battery tester and it passed well within the "good battery" full charge limits. The results were much better than the charger that came with the battery pack where it tested NEAR "weak".Very happy with the purchase. I would buy this exact model again. Should there be any problem(s) in the future I will update this review.Ships from and sold by Amazon. 
Not much to say, they are what they are, and at a great price! These are high quality, and I only use the best in my 2003 Subaru Impreza WRX Sport Wagon. ^^ I use these in the home garage and am not a master mechanic.  This feeler gauge set is great buy.  The feelers are clearly laser marked in both in and mm.  There is a great variety to create any thickness you want to gauge.  They easily come apart to create a gauge or rearrange your most used to the top.  These were the same OEM brand offered at my local Autozone for half the price. These are great blades made by Anco.  They are beam style blades that hug your windshield.  They leave a streak free shine and are great in the rain.  They are easy to install and work great.  I can say these are comparable to the Bosch brand blades, and would recommend these highly.  5 stars. 
Clipped onto the doorlock and door latch rods securely and installed onto the inner door release handle nice and firm.  Worked perfectly. No more "nagging" to close the screen door! You could probably buy a spring at your local hardware store for about the same price, but the pre-determined install tension (distance to drill holes) and where to mount the spring(s) makes it well worth the $7. I followed the instructions for screw hole distance and only needed 1 spring. Both springs may pull the door past the latch at rest (without door swinging closed), but a normal entry/exit the single spring has enough to overcome the latch without slamming the door. Great tool for clamping hard to reach radiator hose clamps.  Its multi-position locking mechanism will make sure to clamp and hold various sized clamps- unlike other pliers that can only hold in the fully close position. 
Easily flexible, not difficult to work into the slotted channel. Just set one side and work the other as you go across - shouldn't be any need for tools to insert this unless you have screws holding the channel that were not centered and flat in the channel.  If that's the case, you'll want to use a plastic type tool to avoid puncturing the vinyl. If you leave spark plugs in an aluminum head for 100,000 miles, your spark plugs may break or the threads strip when you try to remove them.  Using anti-seize is supposed to prevent this.  If you use it, torque to the lower end of the tolerance because of the added lubrication from the anti-seize.  I never had spark plugs stuck even without anti-seize so I can't say for certain that it works but it is cheap insurance.  You can use it on any fasteners subject to corrosion. Makes easy work of filling your batteries. You don't have to see into the holes just push down and wait for the gurgling to stop.always the correct level. 
FRAM CH9972 Full-Flow Lube Cartridge FilterFit and work great in our Toyota Camey 6CYLYes I recommend these.RagenRat I have been using these and K&M filters.  Both are rated very well.  They seem to work as advertised and were shipped quickly. Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars 
these clips worked great. I removed the old door catches and replaced with these ones and they look and work just like  factory clips . These Rugged Ridge 7/8 pin shackles are Heavy Duty! The threaded portion is 7/8 and the Pin shank is .991 I had to do just a little clearancing on my aftermarket bumper for these to work... no big deal, they look great and I`m sure they will perform well! The finish is very nice! These are well build and durable. Although i cut the alligator clips off the product works great and will last. 
Easy to replace. It lacks Toyota instructions, but it is exactly like existing Toyota part with all wires colored the same way so it is very obvious how to connect those.The original part has a silicone rubber tube going all the way from top to bottom with wires running inside it. This part only provides a short length of tubing that, at best, would cover half of the length of wires on my car.I thing they should provide a &#34;telescoping&#34; tubing of two diameters with one going inside of the other while you are crimping wires and then extended to cover the full length of wires The Tender Jr. does not come with a cigarette adapter so I cut this in half to make two. I purchased 2 lighter plugs for a buck each from China&#8230; with free shipping&#8230; and they are working fine. These aren&#8217;t an exact match with the Tender cables but they fit together OK and are easy to determine polarity with the wire colors. You can also just use this as an extension cord for your Tender. The description states a length of 12-inches&#8230; but it&#8217;s actually 14-inches tip-to-tip on the connectors. Nice item for the price and it&#8217;s made in Mexico. There are two horns, not one. One is 400Hz and the other one is 500Hz.PIAA | Automotive Sports Horn (400/500Hz) #85110The are exact fits on the mounts as the OEM horns and use the same bolts. A 1/4 inch drive ratchet and a 12mm socket is needed to remove and install the bolt. They came with grounding leads with ring spade lugs that mounted readily under the existing M6 bolts on the radiator supports. All you need is a 10mm socket.The two wiring harness leads are too short to connect the horns. Two wire tie mounts hold the harness to the aluminum bumper reinforcement. You can cut off the ties and use the OEM harness to connect the horns, but I chose not to.  I prefer NOT to cut off the OEM connector blocks.I made two pigtail extensions out of 18 gauge black primary wire, 5 inches long. One end needs a 1/4 inch wide exposed male quick disconnect. The other end needs an insulated female 1/4 inch quick disconnect terminal. Since I used 18 gauge wire, I used the red coded ones.The exposed male connector slides into the OEM horn connector perfectly. The female one clips easily onto the positive terminal of each horn.The horns how have a weather shield on the apertures.Best thing to my surprise is that they appear to be very high quality and Made in Japan.Also nice is that they need no modification to the horn relay or circuit. 
I couldn't agree more with the pluses made by other reviewers; see any 5 star reviews.However, it has 1 major drawback as general purpose test leads.Lantern tipsThe head of the main probes is flared like a male banana jack, Fluke calls these 'lantern tip probes'.  This is helpful when inserting the jacks into banana females and for much electrical work, but when probing tight spaces like circuit components or feet of through hole DIP ICs, and worse on SMT components, lantern probes make the tips too wide, even if they are sharp.  Sometimes minigrabbers will work, but most times simple thin leads are all that's universally needed.Worst of all, you cannot insert these probes into a NEMA power socket to check the status of the hot or neutral lines, but it will fit the ground plug.  They are better for general electrical work for circular holes found in European style power sockets.In addition:PVCPVC is widely used, including as a low cost insulator for electrical wiring.  Alas, both in the EU and USA, there is a move to restrict its use for consumer products because its plasticizers is associated with major health issues; soft PVC [e.g. wires] is more a problem than hard PVC [e.g. drainage pipes].  Its not a problem for wires installed in homes, but as a test lead the user makes daily contact with PVC, or if ignited accidentally such as during a current surge or a solder iron misplacement, may release dioxin.Other than that, these leads are just as electrically good as a $50+ Fluke lead setFluke Corporation TL220 Industrial Test Lead Kit.What does >3x more cost get you?  The Fluke probe tips are the common thin design.  Fluke leads use silicone-rubber instead of PVC, a more expensive insulator that is lighter, and inert [its used from breast implants to tubing used in the food industry], more supple, soft, and easier to grip.  The Extech use PVC.  They are both electrically capable of CAT III-1000V rating and more, but the Fluke materials make probing with these leads repeatedly less taxing, something a professional electrician would notice with daily use.In September 2010, Extech released their own silicone test leads and kits.  It uses the standard thin probe tip, like Fluke.  A pair of the Extech leads alone cost as much as their entire PVC based test lead kit, so part of the Fluke's higher cost is at least in the materials. These are not your cheap run of the mill clips. They are very thick and durable; solder joints on clips are good too. This product is definitely well made. First, Permatex makes good products.  This is no different.  There are some products labeled similarly but do not contain true silicone in the same way this product does.This is useful for lubricating all sorts of things.  From moving parts you wish to keep lubricated such as door slides and hinges and other hardware such as that.  It will also help to prevent oxidation (rust) from occurring.  It is also very good for applying to plastic and rubber to both keep them with a film of lubricant which you might want on something such as "rubber" weatherstripping on the sides of car windows.  It is also good for for using to keep rubber, vinyl and most plastic parts from drying out.This is a product that goes on wet and while it will dry it will not completely evaporate but leave a protective film of silicone which is a good thing.This is not like products such as penetrating oils like Liquid Wrench or WD-40.  Those are good for their purpose but they are lighter lubricants made for penetrating and not leaving the same sort of film as this silicone spray.There are some items that could also be well lubricated with spray lithium grease but this has the advantage of being clear so it does not remain white so it is nice in that sense.The price here right now is significantly more expensive than the local auto parts store.  I would check prices before purchasing.  I love Amazon and sometimes they have the best price and certainly some of the best customer serviceyou will ever find but you do need to check prices as sometimes prices can be much higher (or lower) from place to place.As an aside, contrary to one persons review, this product is NOT an electrical conductor but just the opposite it is an insulator.It is contained in dielectric grease so do not get it on contacts of electronic products!  It can be used carefully on sockets for electronic connections to be used such as dielectric grease but do not get it on the actual metal contact parts themselves.  I tried to post a link to Wiki about silicone that explains this but Amazon does not allow which is why you see the dots in brackets instead.[...]There are other silicone sprays out there, some are also good, some are not.  Be careful to ensure you get what you are after.That is one thing good about Permatex products, they are a trustworthy company and their products are usually one of the best options for their purposes and they have a huge variety of products for very specific uses, most often in automotive products.  So this is a trustworthy brand that you know what you are getting is as described on the label and you are getting what you pay for.  Just make sure you pay the most reasonable price you can find. 
These were a perfect fit for my 2001 Silverado 2500HD with the 6.0 but I had to do some research to make sure I bought the correct wire set.  GM used round or square coils (two different manufacturers) for a few years and the plug wire lengths are different. If you have the round coils (plug wire connector on the bottom of the coil) you need these shorter wires ending in &#34;GG&#34;.  If you have the square coils with the plug wire connector on the side of the coil, you need the longer wires ending in &#34;HH&#34;. The HH wires are about 1.5 inches longer for than the GG's.  You cannot make the shorter wires reach a square coil. It does get a bit warm while providing the 5 amps of power to the Koolatron car cooler (which I took into hotel rooms at night), but it did exactly what it was supposed to do so can't complain. One issue: There are two different sizes for so-called "cigarette lighter" outlets. This has the "big" size, which means "small" size plugs can have issues. Solution if that is a problem for your particular plug is simply to use a toothpick to "shim" the small-size plug into the large-size socket. The Tender Jr. does not come with a cigarette adapter so I cut this in half to make two. I purchased 2 lighter plugs for a buck each from China&#8230; with free shipping&#8230; and they are working fine. These aren&#8217;t an exact match with the Tender cables but they fit together OK and are easy to determine polarity with the wire colors. You can also just use this as an extension cord for your Tender. The description states a length of 12-inches&#8230; but it&#8217;s actually 14-inches tip-to-tip on the connectors. Nice item for the price and it&#8217;s made in Mexico. 
The 3rd generation powerprobe includes a number of changes for additional flexibility.  In short, it is a vehicle powered DVM with both a 20 foot cable and an additional 20 foot extension giving you a 40 foot working range around either the battery terminals or cigarette lighter outlet, both clips and a plug are included in the kit.With the series 3 units they use a hard gold plated banana jack to hold the removable probe or cables to extend your reach.  If you purchase the accessory kit, it includes piercing probes that self center on a conductor, pierce the insulation, and attach to the jack allowing you to tap a wire at any point to locate intermittant problems.While the DVM is backlit all the time, it also has 2 bright white LEDs facing forward to aid in finding and probing terminals in dark places.  The actual probe is hardgold plated with a sharp tip and removable at the banana jack.  Another identical probe is included with a screw-in female banana jack in the accessories kit to retrofit the powerprobe I and II units to accept external cables and probes.If you need to excite a circuit with a connection to battery ground or to battery positive, the switch allows a momentary connection to bridge the probe tip to either voltage which is useful in testing relay driven circuits, indicator lights, and other small current loads.  The prope voltage is always displayed during testing on the meter. The voltage/ground switch is circuit breaker protected in case you accidentally drive 12 volts into a chassis ground.  Additionally, since the switch takes abuse it is easily replaced if it fails with just a screwdriver.Combined with the testlead set, the powerprobe 3 greatly simplifies testing of vehicular wire and big rigs up to a single trailer.  The DVM has 5 selectable modes of operation designed for different problems.  Reading the manual is important to get the full value from this meter.Although the price is a little high, the design and construction quality are excellent.  Enough wire is provided to check running lights on trailers or to look for blown fuses.  All of the wiring is exceptionally flexible and heavily insulated with top quality connectors.  Both the tester and accessories come in hard plastic cases that can be stowed in a service box.Not mentioned in specifications is that although the probe runs from 12-24 VDC, the meter can be used to measure voltages up to 80VDC. Don't believe the ad statement 'heavy duty cord' translates into 'heavy duty' anything, other than maybe rubber insulation. THIS IS FOR LOW-POWER ITEMS ONLY!!! It is 20-AWG wire inside, barely enough wire diameter to run a 5-watt speaker. If you think you are going to plug in a tire inflator, a 1,000,000 candle spotlight, etc., you are SADLY MISTAKEN. This is NOT, repeat NOT heavy duty. It is a crime that the wire AWG (American Wire Gauge) is not listed in the specs. Otherwise, you would know that plugging in a heavy amperage load is either going to burn this up in a split second, or turn it into a heater coil and set your car on fire when you try. If you want to charge a cell phone, an iPad, etc. on it, go ahead, no problem. But the problem is, most people buy an extension cord for a cigarette lighter to do something with a heavy amp load outside of the vehicle. This WILL NOT support a heavy amp load. After a power outage, I connected my refrigerator to this power supply. Sadly, its inverter was unable to support my refrigerator. The Duracell DPP-600HD doesn't have enough momentary  output to handle the initial start-up current spike of a refrigerator's compressor motor. The specifications say it can momentarily provide up to 960 watts. This equates to 8 amps at 120v.  Yet, public benchmark figures for a home refrigerator's start-up current indicate 13 amps for up to 1/2 second. Other appliances that use electric motors such as sump pumps are likely to exhibit the same characteristics. My suggestion is that customers immediately test this product with any device they intend to power during an outage.Some important specifications are missing in the Amazon listing.  One of the key statics is the capacity of the internal battery, which is 28 amp-hours at 12 v.  This equates to 336 watt hours.  Yet, AC output is much lower than this presumably due to inverter losses.  These losses increase with power output.  The following table illustrates this.  The last column is my calculation.load.................watts....hours....watt-hoursCordless telephone.....5........35.0 ...175Portable stereo.........10........22.0 ...220Laptop computer.......20........7.0 ....140Fan.......................100.........1.7....17036" TV...................133........1.2 ....1603/8 drill.................300........0.4 ....115Warm-air fan heater.312........0.4 ....109Blender..................385........0.3 ....109HID Floodlights.......400........0.3.....107Observe that the total energy delivered (watt-hour) drops with power consumption.  Ultimately, the usable energy is significantly less than what is contained within the lead acid battery.For reference, a refrigerator will use about 200 watts of electricity when the compressor is running. Typical consumers will have their refrigerator running about 50% to 60% of the time, which equates to an average of 100-120 watts being consumed continuously.ConsDoesn't handle current spikes associated with certain electric motorsProsBoth AC and DC outputPortableSimple operation 
I installed one of these springs at the bottom of the door.  As others have said, 1 seems plenty strong to close the door without making it slam.  If you only hold the door a few inches open, it won't latch.  But if you open it like you are walking out it will close tight and the latch engages.I think installing the second spring will make the door slam too hard.  But its nice having the second spring just in case you need it.I installed it using the existing screw on the outside of the screen door (where the hinge attaches).  I think measured up 9" (as the directions say) and drilled a hole such that the spring fits between the screen door and the outside door when they are both closed.- to be clear - when you are standing outside the camper, with the screen door closed, you see the spring go from the hinge on the screen door to the door frame.The pictures in the directions seemed a little confusing to me.  It looks more like they want you to put the spring on the inside of the door.  But then you have the spring dragging across the frame when you open the door, scratching the frame and probably making a lot of noise.My way of installing it has zero noise (the spring is not rubbing on anything) and it works nicely.Just make sure there is adequate clearance between your outside door and your screen door before installing the spring.I will take a picture if I get a chance and post it.*** UPDATE ***I added a picture with notes.We had the camper out for 5 days and the spring worked great.  Using just 1 spring is enough to close the screen door and it even will pull the combined screen & exterior doors closed.  (not hard enough to latch, but closed).  I think I will leave it as-is and keep the second spring as a backup. No more "nagging" to close the screen door! You could probably buy a spring at your local hardware store for about the same price, but the pre-determined install tension (distance to drill holes) and where to mount the spring(s) makes it well worth the $7. I followed the instructions for screw hole distance and only needed 1 spring. Both springs may pull the door past the latch at rest (without door swinging closed), but a normal entry/exit the single spring has enough to overcome the latch without slamming the door. This product fits like it should and would look really nice if it had been shipped properly!  I got it and the box was all crunched.  The item had no cushioning around it and the front is bent in.  Need to return for a replacement!  It would have been 5 stars if the front had not been bent in and it was packed properly!  Fits right over my 3 burner RV stove and rest on the counter top.  I will be adding rubber feet so that it will scratch the sides of my stove nor my counter top!  To secure it you have to screw it to the counter top.  The back has a hing with 5 screw holes in it where you can secure it or it will stay put without screwing it down.  It came with 5 long screws.  Not sure if i want to secure mine yet.  I have a new RV and not sure i want to put screw holes in the knife holder behind the stove! 
The last time I drained my gray water tank on my trailer, I sort of cross threaded the cap and busted off on the the tabs, making the cap unusable.This is a great replacement and I like the fact that I can attach a hose to the cap to drain my gray water tank into a container, or if I am boondocking/dry camping, I can just run the hose away from my trailer to drain the sink water! For the most part I need to retain my grey water to assist in flushing out the system when dumping the black water.BUT for those times where I need to let some grey water out discreetly I can. The hose connection allows me to run it away from the TT and into the woods. I meant to take some pics of the built up chain oil and road debris before I performed the cleaning but I did not.  I have Yoshi R-22 chrome dual exhaust that was absolutely corroded.  This product not only took the burnt/caked/rust on stuff off, it also keeps it off.  I can now just rub my finger over the area and remove the crud.  With this oil cannot burn into the chrome.Buy it now. 
Does a super job on brass, copper, silver, aluminum, bronze and stainless steel. Polishes most metals to a mirror-like finish. Very similar to Flitz polishing cream. This scratch remover seems to be more of a polish  and lube that will remove the surface scratches for the paint. It does not appear to have any &#34;grinding&#34; type ingredients in the paste.It will have little of no impact on deep scratches or deep nicks in the paint. It is easy to out on and remove and will a decent job for those light scratches. It did not remove any discoloring on my paint such as a stain left by a bird dropping. It ddi make the blemish lighter though. Does what it says it does......looks great ! 
I have two cars, both of which require the large #14 sheet metal self-tapping screws to mount the plate to the nylon retainers behind the plate (the ones mounted on the car that the screws screw into). Problem is that diameter of the plastic ring that holds the screw covers is too small to take the screw's large diameter head. The maximum screw head diameter that will fit the ring is .435 inch (11 millimeters). Option 1: Replace the nylon retainers on the car, but different cars have different retainers so one must search for new ones that will accept a #12 screw. Option 2: Try to find #14 self-tapping screws with smaller heads. I shopped around for #14 screws with smaller heads to no avail. Option 3: Grind down the screw head's diameter. Option 4 (not good): On one car I used #12 sheet metal screws that have a smaller diameter, but DO fit the rings, and wrapped the threads with tape. This sort of works, but I really can't tighten them down satisfactorily. So I have to check their security now and then. I'm leaving the other car as is for now. Maybe someone has more practical ideas? Sure would like to hear of them. BTW, SEE THE UPDATE BELOW.UPDATE 11/16/13:I think I've found a viable solution to the above problem. I used a #12 sheet metal self-tapping screw, placed a 1/2-inch long piece of ordinary shrink tubing (1/4" i.d.) over the threads towards the pointed end of the screw. Used a heat gun (or you can use a match, BIC lighter or soldering iron) to shrink the tubing which effectively increases the thread diameter to about that of a #14 screw. This allows me to tighten the screw securely and will last much longer than ordinary tape. One more thing: The THICKNESS of the screw head doesn't quite allow the chrome cap to fully snap into place over the nylon ring. The top of the head needs to be filed down a little leaving enough Philips "X" to use the screwdriver. I should have gotten the Honda cap.  This fits OK, but the screws are not "captured" in the cap.  With the original cap,the screws cannot fall out.  Considering the position of the screws when mounting this, captured screws are an advantage. I've gotten a few sets of these (4) to cover the heads of my front and rear license plate bolts and I've had mostly good results from these covers. I reviewed a separate kit that came with the bolts and threaded plastic mounts for your bumper but that did not directly talk about the covers (I think, who can remember?). These covers and the clear plastic rings which allow the caps to be held in place are easy to install with the single exception that the holes in the clear plastic rings are almost always a little larger that the diameter of the bolts holding your plate in place. This creates the small problem of a chance to accidently crush the top of the ring as you re-tighten each bolt because the ring will sit low on the bolt threads causing the outer portion of the ring (which allows the cap to &#34;snap&#34; and be held in place) so that it falls under the back of the bolt head. So you'll need to slip the ring over the bolt head and you get near the end of tightening down the bolt. The only other problem I've had with these caps is that one cap in one set (new) split as I was snapping it onto the clear plastic ring. I had extras form an old set so no big deal. I never &#34;lost&#34; one of these caps from it popping off during driving so they're a great cover and they do come in multiple colors depending on what you're looking for. I recommend this product. 
This isn't going to be used with a nail gun , but it works well for tires . It's not the fastest, but it works . It threads on  to the valve so you don't have to sit there and hold it down . This way you can get to a safe place if your on the side of the road ... there are other tools that work just as good, if not better, for half or even less then the price of this.Plain and simple this is a great roller, the rubber head doesn't cut or tear into the foil backing of the sound deadening mat and really helps you put good even pressure to hard to reach areas. That and it saves wear and tear on your hands.But like I said there are cheaper alternatives like a super cheap wallpaper seam roller (you can find some with a rubber or wooden roller) or my personal favoritea "J" roller. With the J roller you can use the roller or even the curved handle to apply pressure to the sound deadening mat. You can even use old roller skate/blade wheels.So to recap:Great toolSaves your hands from a ton of wear and tearWorks greatBUT other tools/items can be had that do the same thing for much less. This is a nice size for getting in tight places where the exhaust is close to the body or drive train. This will save your butt if the threads are in bad shape just use anti seize and take your time. 
This debate just goes on and on...i don't know which is better. I have RP running in my transfer case and Amsoil in my tranny. Can i tell a difference? NOPE! They both seem to have great specs on paper with Amsoil has a slight edge on the viscosity around 100C degree, other than that, they are pretty much the same. Both are synthetic.  The only difference is RP is actually purple in color and you can get it off of Amazon. Amsoil, you have to buy direct. A number of reviewers have commented that the accuracy of this gauge is 0.1 psi.  It isn't.  The accuracy spec is +- 0.5 psi +- 1% of the reading.  This means that the gauge could show anything between 34.1 to 35.9 for a tire actually filled to 35 psi.Long story short...don't believe that 1/10 digit number that's being displayed.  If there's a slight change in tire pressure, it'll show it, but the actual value can vary significantly from what's shown. There are many other products like the ctech but this is clearly one of the highest quality. The best part is there are optional wires that fit many needs or if you have multiple vehicles.

works greatinstalls easilyprotects as advertisedlooks good toowhy pay more at the dealer (stealership) these work great I have been using this since the mid 1970's it really works. You will see better so you will feel more relaxed driving in the rain. Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.  The pickle fork is the last resort for me, as it will damage the balljoint boot.I prefer to use the Snap On balljoint remover.  If that one cannot fit, then I will try this tool.  If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork. 
These item does fit perfect on my 2004 BMW x3. does what its suppose to do. so far so good thanks fits my car perfectly, works perfectly, was easy to install. The best measure of a wiper blade is that it does what it is supposed to do, when it is supposed to do it. Does what it is designed to do and Amazon has great prices on them. But, if you are replacing yours on a ford f-250 with 5.4 go with 15718 with the longer cord. And a 2003 f250 w/5.4L only has 2 not 4 like it shows. 
I have previously used in: 1980 Honda CX500C to fix a rough idle, 2000 Suzuki SV650 to stabilize fuel, and a 2005 Chevy Cobalt to fix a problem with stalling at idle. They do work.

This product appears to include the cable. IT DOESN'T. It's just the mount which it does okay, but you'll have to buy the cable separately. A solid quality product well described and shown in the ad, nothing misleading, nothing hidden.  The cable is thick enough for the length and amperage, the connector tight and well formed, and the length was as stated. The Tender Jr. does not come with a cigarette adapter so I cut this in half to make two. I purchased 2 lighter plugs for a buck each from China&#8230; with free shipping&#8230; and they are working fine. These aren&#8217;t an exact match with the Tender cables but they fit together OK and are easy to determine polarity with the wire colors. You can also just use this as an extension cord for your Tender. The description states a length of 12-inches&#8230; but it&#8217;s actually 14-inches tip-to-tip on the connectors. Nice item for the price and it&#8217;s made in Mexico. 
This makes it SO easy to charge in conjunction with my battery tender.  So far it has fit all my vehicles batteries ( Acura integra, Toyota Tundra, Toyota Pickup ) Did not fit my car's filter harness after Amazon's compatibility tool said it would, there was a 1.5&#34; gap compared to the OEM filter, I have a 2006 Honda Civic Si - steer clear of this if you own the same car California 2000 V6 Camry with P1150 and P1155. Two of my code tables show as Bank 1 Sensor 2 A/F sensor so I ordered the Denso 234-4209 O2 sensor. Came in on time and package well protected but looks like its the wrong one - my fault, somewhat. Turns out, as far as I could tell, my two tables from two different sources had it backwards as it should be Bank 2 Sensor 1 A/F and Denso/Amazon order check didn't help much either.Anyway, Bank 2 Sensor 1 is the one on the engine right front (easy to get to) where Denso refer as Upstream Front. I gave it 5 stars base on previous experience, will order this one later.Why the a few of you refer as Bank 1 Sensor 1 and still corrected the check engine light? That would not be this one for the the Toyota V6 but Denso 234-9007 where they refer as Upstream Rear. Am I wrong?Seems like I'm not the only one confused based on superceeded information on P1150 and P1155.This one is for Bank 2 Sensor 1 for the Toyota V6 engine (mine is the 1MZFE). 
C'mon. This is something they mass produce across the ocean with the cheapest parts they can manufacture. I suggest buying a good metal hose valve, a small straight nozzle and 18" of clear tubing at your local Home Improvement store. It will last longer. Bought this to use withValterra F02-4100 45 RV Hydroflushso I could wash out my tanks.Here is my review of that setuphttp://www.amazon.com/Valterra-F02-4100-45%C2%B0-RV-Hydroflush/product-reviews/B0002UHVAA/ref=cm_cr_dp_synop?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints;=0&sortBy;=bySubmissionDateDescending#R2CUAU2B8XC98QIt works great.I also like that I have this as an emergency backup if one of my valves ever fails. You can't say much about this quick disconnect plug. But one for sure: having it installedcharging your motorcycle is much easier than using those old fashioned alligator clamps.If you also interested in buying a battery maintainer the harness is included in this one:&#34;Black & Decker BM3B 6V and 12V Battery Charger / Maintainer&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051D3MP6/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0You may also like to hear that there is a adapter available from SAE-2-USB plug available:&#34;SAE to USB Adapter - Motorcycle Cell Phone Charger&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007VFFQRE/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1So if you also use a navigation system while riding you can easily charge this on the road. 
I put this plug into my BMW F650GS and it runs like a different bike.  No stumble or surging at part throttle and great response all the way to red line.  I was thinking I was going to have to get a $200 electronic device to fix the stumble but an $8 plug fixed it.  I wouldn't have believed it but....... just saying. 3 weeks ago my CEL light came on.  The car ran fine, there was no sensation of a defect.  I could pull the battery and wait 5 minutes, which is a reset spec for OBD II without a reader, but what if the issue was serious, later on?  Calling the car dealership, a diagnostic ran $75.  A Toyota TSB released in 2006 said a common issue was simply a loose gas cap.  I tightened it, and tried to reset the CEL.  No go.  Ordered the reader, as I'll need it anyway for other issues as they arise with the CEL.  Followed the instruction, diagnosed the issue, checked it against the Toyota troubleshooting manual, and presto, CEL is gone.  For $47 versus the $75, not only is the problem fixed, I know how to do it [ priceless!] and I now have a tool to diagnose these pesky electronic computer modules that feeds data to the CEL, just to insure the dealership is up to snuff, or I can fix it myself [sometimes it can be just a loose hose.]It rates 4/5 for 2 reasons:The cord is short.  Its OK, but the unit will not raise to a comfortable chest height connected to the OBD II jack, one has to crouch down;No backlight, crouched in the dark driver pedal area, a small LED or something would help a ton, given how dark it is down there and the cabin light doesn't light one's feet.Other than that, its so simple even a cave man can do it. I changed my 2002 Mazda Protege 5 speed gear oil at 48K to Mobil 1 synthetic.  The shifting was notchy from that time on, sometimes grinding a little.  Now at 78K I decided to change it to Red Line.  The difference is shocking to me.  The shifting is smooth as silk, no grinding and no more notchy shifting.  I will never use anything else going forward.  I'm sold. 
This is designed to work with the Valterra bayonet fitting on your Gray or Black water dump valve and it does just that... This tool is perfect for solo bleeding brakes. All you do is attach it to a bottle/jar/container via some adapters and tubing and then bleed away without the fear of getting air back into the brake lines.The only tiny problem is that the tubing attached to the bleeder screw is a air tight one way check valve so when you take it off a large amount of brake fluid is trapped on the intake side of the tube and if your not careful may make quite a mess on the calipher. I wish they included some button on the tool to open the check valve fully to allow the excess fluid trapped in the tubing to flow downward into the container to minimize the chances to make a mess. This is a high-quality, well made grease gun. It connects well, and you have to move the connection sideways to pop it off the grease fitting - which is perfect because you do not want on that pops off easily. I pumped a lot of grease through this into hubs and the pressure was high, the pump action was smooth and nothing leasked. When disconnected, it also does not leak (it does not pressure out unless you pump it). 
I cut the horn off the compressor. The horn will fit under the stock cowbell. The compressor was attached under the right side panel to the frame with 3 large zip ties. I ran some hose from home depot to the cowbell and connected it to the stock horn wire. The horn sound goes right between the cylinders and is loud as h3ll.  Many of cell phone scum bags will tell you that my set up works real good.

I had no idea Chevy would put 2 serpentines on a newer generation vehicle. This smaller belt fits the A/C system only. It works like a champ and fits perfectly. I would recommend the Gatorback belts to EVERYONE! As an installation side note, you have to remove the air intake and larger serpentine to get to this "bottom of the motor" mounted unit.... way to engineer that one GM! 
GLAD  I  WENT  WITH  THE  CHROME AND  NOT  THE BLACK ONE, I  HOOKED  THIS ONE UP TO  MY GV1400 MOTORCYCLE IF  YOU  HAVE JUST  A  LITTLE  KNOW  HOW YOU CAN  DO  IT YOUR SELF , ALL  YOU WILL NEED TO GO WITH THIS IS A RELAY THAT DOES NOT COME WITH IT. YOU  CAN  GET IT ON HERE OR ANY PART STORE, I  HAVE MADE MANY PEOPLE JUMP  DUE  TO THE SOUND OF  THE  HORNS  LOUDNESS. Fits like a charm. Looks perfect with stock sidesteps.  Anyone can put these on by themself. I don't see there being a better option for the price. When I bought this product I thought " great I won't need to bring heavy cinder blocks with me anymore." Well, I was wrong.  The top is too narrow for my jack to go on safely.  When I put the camper on it, it seems way to unstable. 
There is no swiveling between the cap, the tube and the bottle. In other words, when you screw/unscrew the cap onto the car's brake fluid container, there will be kinking on the tube itself. Untangling the kinks is a chore because the bottle is both quite big and heavy when it is filled with brake fluid. They should have designed with some quick-connect/disconnect like the compressor air hose. That would be an ideal solution, but I guess it will add to the cost for adding that feature. However, I doubt that it would cost much because I browsed through the air-hose connectors at Harbor Freight and they run typically a couple of bucks each. I might modify this bleeder with the air hose connector to address the problem. Hooking up this valve will make winterizing a recreation vehicle. I place the tread tape on the water pump (facing the valve), and the threads that will connect the water tank and the pump. The plastic grey connector is easier to connect to pump first the tighten it down with a wrench. Now attach the valve to the pump by spinning the valve until tight and snug it up with tools. now attach hose from tank to valve until it is tight. I left the metal cap on until I need to winterize the camper again, but you can leave the hose on the by-pass valve if you likeand curl it up next to the pump. Just make sure you can read the wording on the valve for position it is in. Now you are ready to winterize the pipes at anytime you want. Before it took me about 1 hour to winterize a camper. This was switching the hose from the water tank to a hose to a gallon of RV anti-freeze. Since it took me 15 minutes to install, now the amount of time it will take to winterize my camper will be 5 minutes and no more banged up hands from working in a small area. That is the time to turn the valve and run a gallon of rv anti-freeze thru the system and resetting valve back to water tank. Our new 5th wheel came with the cable pull valves.  They stink!  This way at least I can make sure the tank is empty before I pull off the sewer hose.  Easy to put on.  I especially like the way you can rotate it to whatever direction you need it to be. 
It does get a bit warm while providing the 5 amps of power to the Koolatron car cooler (which I took into hotel rooms at night), but it did exactly what it was supposed to do so can't complain. One issue: There are two different sizes for so-called "cigarette lighter" outlets. This has the "big" size, which means "small" size plugs can have issues. Solution if that is a problem for your particular plug is simply to use a toothpick to "shim" the small-size plug into the large-size socket. 32mm is the correct size for my Jetta TDI oil cap, and this fits perfectly.It's also fairly low profile, another plus. The Tender Jr. does not come with a cigarette adapter so I cut this in half to make two. I purchased 2 lighter plugs for a buck each from China&#8230; with free shipping&#8230; and they are working fine.

it stays stuck, on fiberglass at least.  easily cut to shape.  seems to protect.  i'm using it on the bellypan of my motorcycle track fairing, which is fiberglass.  i'm told fiberglass won't bubble like stock type fairings will, so i may not have needed it.  but i put it on just in case, and whether it's because i didn't need it or the stuff is working, but my paint isn't bubbling.  which is all i care about. I haven't used them yet but they look good and it will do what I need. I need to wash my car I guess Exactly what I needed to add to my box of wheelin components, I'll save a tree when I need to hook up & pull &#34;other&#34; people out 
with plastic bumpers being the norm, thought I'd use this plastic polish.  It brings the shine to the plastic painted areas just like step 2 does to the metal. This is one other item you need for your Hi-Lift jack. This allows you to lift curved bumpers, or ones without notches in them specifically for this type of jack. Great small accessory that goes well with the jack itself. Heavy duty and will last many years. I did modify this with some rubber to not mar metal finish of my bumpers though. If you have plastic bumpers, don't use this, it will leave marks. A friend of mine did that with my jack and them complained. Like it was the jacks fault he was stupid. This is metal and could scratch if you are trying to lift someone that is softer material. Comes with bolts that look too small but do the job. I added larger ones that are stronger, but the ones that come with it are rated for the correct weight loading. You need this for your jack. Will help with some fence posts of odd shape as well. The quality of this tool appears good. Fit and finish are nice, and the steel base looks forged and not cast. The screw turns smoothly even if the handle is a bit sharpHowever the throat of this tool is not deep enough to get over what look liike normal sized wiper arms on my 2012 Jetta SportWagan. When placed on the arm the center of the threaded rod only reaches to the edge of the wiper arm stud. I got the tool to work but it involved leaving the wiper arm nut on the stud about 4 turns loose and placing a thick steel washer on top of the nut to make a flat surface for the puller stud to press against.

They are light and take up less space than several 2x6's (product description states, 2.8 x 6.5 x 8.9 inches ; 2.4 pounds). I highly recommend them. They fit my trailers' stabilizers perfectly. Great price and value, at least for now, I will update if this changes. The waffle design can trap dirt and if that is a concern just turn them waffle-side up. The idea is that the stabilizers do not sink into the dirt, not to support the full weight of an RV. They do what they are designed to do. Sizes listed in reviews and the two in the description (15.8 x 10.5 x 5, and 12.5 x 9.5 x 7) don't match to what I received...The bag I received is in between what has been listed in the descriptions:  13.5" x 9" x 6" (empty).While seemingly a good quality bag, with a fair amount of straps and attached rain-cover (hidden in the heel of the bag), it seems the manufacturer (or seller) has no idea how to use a measuring tape!The bag itself is quite nice... good padding, rubberized bottom to prevent sliding, small pockets on either side, and zippers seem of reasonable quality.For the price and bag quality, I'm not complaining.  It works great on my CB750, and it does fit on the pillion of my VT1100c2 (without having to remove my rider backrest)  So if you have standard seating (or a touring/adventure style), this bag will do well for you as a pillion bag, and with a little strap adjustments, it also fits vertical on the front or back of a sissy-bar, or horizontal on a larger luggage rack... 
This works very well for blowing out water supply lines in an RV's plumbing system.  Be aware that there can be water still in the lines even after blowing out air through every faucet, so when winterizing, it can't hurt to use a RV safe antifreeze just to keep the water at the low spots (elbows, valves) from freezing. Make sure you find a bucket where this can sit somewhat snug at the bottom.I used a standard sized bucket (the kind you get at your local home improvement store).. everytime I fill the bucket with water, the grid guard will invariably float up off the bottom.That said, it's handy to scrub your wash mitt against to trap dirt from washing, but I'm not overly thrilled with this product. Nice tight fit on my camper van.  Since I have a composting toilet and don't use the black water tank, I leave this cap on all the time and use a 6' standard hose for the gray water.  Highly recommended. 
Does what it says it does......looks great ! Not much to say, it either works or it doesn't.... this product is not rocket science and does what it claims. It say's that it doesn't fit on my 04 Crown Vic but, it does :) Just to let people know! 
I use this for the frame of my SUV, it was little rusty and I want to stop the rust getting worse. I accidentally dripped few drops when apply it to the frame. and after few hours the drops on the driveway became hard and solid plastic like thing, and hard to remove, I feel this will do a good job prevent the rust on the SUV. warning: results may vary.  Especially if you don't fix the crack immediately.Both of my cars got windshield cracks.  One had a long crack from the right side to the middel of the glass.The other is more recent and had a crack no more than 1" in diameter.Since the crack, I've had to wash the car, use the windshield fluid, driving for a about 2 months, before I bought this kit and attempted the repair.The result is not good.  It is just about as visible as it was before the repair.I've done it step by step to the instructions given but I think the pressure to inject the epoxy into the crack is not enough pressure so it doesn't really get into the gaps.I then used the remaining liquid epoxy to repair the other long crack and to no surprise, it did little improvement to the long crack.I am not saying it's not a good product (it's even patented with patent number printed on the blister pack).But buyer be warned.  And repair any crack ASAP without washing the car or driving under dusty conditions.I even cleaned the crack area with cleaner spray for my Mac computer.  It as good as you can get, but still not good enough because dirt has already gotten into the gaps (I think.)Good luck on your repair and remember: time is of the essence. I bought this along with some CRC mass air flow sensor cleaner. This was the firs time I had ever done this. Regarding the throttle body I was able to leave it in place on the engine and spray around the area. I used a cloth to clean the noticeable grime on butterfly flap. I then sprayed a little more and used a q-tip to clean the circular edge around the flap which removed a significant amount of grime. I also sprayed on the cloth and wiped inside the butterfly flap removing some more grime. I noticed quite a difference on startup. Definitely better response and when I fired her up there was some slight burning and little smoke came out for a split second. All was normal after a couple miles of driving. Great DIY 
If you don't have one of these you need to get one. All you have to do is put it in the can stick the open end in the tank and shake the tube and the gas goes in the tank. No mess no hassel. I got four of them for all my ATV, motorcycles, jet skis and boats. Works great! Works like a dream! No "Robin Williams RV" episodes for me! I should have bought one of these earlier, it would have saved me some time flushing my tank out. When I don't have a long line behind me at the dump station, I can almost get the blackwater tank clear. It only takes 2 or 3 flushes to get it "good enuff". MY EXPERIENCE: One of the things I really like about this funnel, is how long it is. It can literally reach down inside an automotive engine with ease, so that I can pour new oil into the crankcase, without getting it all over the engine, which could cause an oil fire!The bottom of the funnel is narrow for the first 6 inches. Which means, I can get it into a tractor dipstick tube, and effortlessly add oil. Because of the total length of the funnel, I am able to add more oil at a time, without worrying about spilling out of the funnel.Because of this same feature, I am able to put it through the filler hole of a vehicle gas tank, and it will stay there, and then I can pickup my gas can, and add a couple gallons of gas to the tank.OTHER USES: Here is another use, many of you may have not thought of. With a small mower, to drain the oil, all you have to do is tip the mower to its side, and let it drain into a pan. However, you can't do this with a tractor, because the engine is mounted to the tractor frame. So, I cant get a pan under the frame because there is my right side wheel in the way. After I attach my drain tube to the drain valve on my engine, I then take the Super Funnel, and place the tube into it, and then the funnel, into the oil pan. There you go, draining made simple!CONCLUSION: Though, I had to spend more then I would for any regular funnel, it is well worth the cost I spent on it, when I consider what uses I can get out of it. Like I said, tiny funnels are great for small things, but for larger engines, you need to get serious. I just love my Super Funnel, and if you buy one, you will too! 5 out of 5 
This couldn't be simpler...put it at the bottom of your wash bucket, and as you rinse the dirt off your sponge/mitt/brush/whatever, it sinks to the bottom, under the Grit Guard where it can't get back on your car. I might be paranoid, but sometimes I do find quite a bit of dirt and grit near the bottom of my wash water...now I don't worry as much about these particles somehow acting like sandpaper against my car's finish.Only drawback is that it doesn't fit smaller buckets.Definitely recommended to anyone fanatical about keeping the car finish pristine. Your wheels typically have a clearcoat, and this is sprayed on, then using a soft brush, you can get all the brake dust off, then rinse the wheel.  But you can ALSO spray the rest of your car with this.  Brake dust settles on the lower part of your car's front doors, so you can spray these along the bottom.  I use my hand (with a glove) to rub the liquid as I hose it down, and it cleans all of the dust and much of the road tar, meaning very little use of the abrasive clay that most detailers will resort to for tough spots.  This is a less aggressive alternative to clay, and should be in every car-lover's arsenal.Recommended! I just finished my first spring washing when a fellow walked by my car and asked if this was 2011 CRV that I waswashing. I told him it was almost 4 years old and he could not believe it. I have to admit that the car does look like due to wonderful Mothers products and some elbow grease.Mothers Carnauba Wax is one of the weapons in keeping my car looking good.I start by washing my car. I don't dry it as this time as water drops will be removed by other steps. Then I clay the car to remove embedded specs, stuck on dirt, and this year I had rubber marks from clearing the snowMothers 07240 California Gold Clay Bar Paint Saving System. I don't clay every inch of the entire car. I just examine the car by sight for any imperfections and by my running my hand over the paint to feel any tiny bumps. When I feel some grittiness or see some dirt on the paint, I generously spray that section with Mothers Showtime Instant Detailer, then knead the piece of clay in my hand and rub it against the spot I identified. Normally, you see the dirt disappear in a few swipes. Sometimes you need to reapply the Detailer and repeat. Kneading is important as you want to work the little pieces of dirt into the clay, and not leave it on the surface of the clay ball where it can scratch the car. I also use the clay on non-painted areas such as glass and chrome if they have stains.After the claying step I wax the car is small sections using Carnauba Wax. It easy to work with.  I put it on a small section (each side of the car is done in 4 sections, for example), by the time I am done spreading it, it is ready to be wiped off, you don't have to wait.  I use micro fiber towels to wipe the wax, using a fresh piece of the fiber on each section.As my final step I apply Back-to-blackMothers 06108 Back-To-Black - 8 ozto non-painted surfaces. This turns the dull plastic into shiny new looking surface. Back-to-black is also effective in removing any wax that might have accidently got on the plastic, that's why I do back-to-black as the last step.Carnauba Wax gives a superior shine.  It is easy and pleasant to work with.  I highly recommend it. 
I love these microfiber cloth! I use them to clean everything! Mostly for my cars! They do not leave scratches on your car and can be use for almost anything! You can't beat the price and there is more than enough for four big calipers. But taping everything is time consuming. I like the kind of caliper paint that comes in a can an use a brush. But I love the finish and the coverage. You just have to tape everything properly. A can of brake parts cleaner is also essential. I Bought a set of these pads and they were sized right for how I used them. I took the pads and screwed them into a 12&#34; 2x6 to give them extra strength and surface area. They provide a handy handle that I use to place my blocks. They are not, in my opinion, heavy duty enough to use as a stand alone jack pad, but work perfect for me the way I configured them. 
First, as with all of the Dupli-Color Metalcast paints, if you want the metalcast effect, you'll have to use the Dupli-Color Metalcast Ground Coat (MC100) on the surface before you apply the color or it will not come out right. The can says that it also comes out the same if you're painting directly onto chrome like surface but I have not tried this so I don't know. Now for this green. I'm more of a blue and purple guy for dark colors so only by my personal preference do I say that this green comes out just a tad light in color for me. Overall though, if you use the ground coat this comes out great with a nice metal sheen. I recommend this product. Returned found better kit with colors that help match RV. You need kit with colors to match most applications. This kit is great! The LEDs are very bright at night and all the colors look good.The music pulse feature is lacking but I didn't expect much from it. 
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. 
I wish there was a guide somewhere that shows you what cars these sunshades fit. I bought this one (Super Jumbo) for my Toyota Camry, hoping it would fit. Well, it did not fit. I had to return it, and order the regular Jumbo sunshade. The regular Jumbo sunshade fits the windshield like a glove. Quality is good, and it folds up to about 14&#34;. So, if you have a 2007-2013 Toyota Camry, DO NOT BUY THIS ONE!!! Order the regular Jumbo size.Amazon, can you please look into getting some sort of reference guide that will show customers the correct vehicle application? This would make buying this product a whole lot easier.CPS When I ordered this, I was guaranteed fitment on a Toyota 3S-FE engine. When it arrived, it was not the correct size. i left two stars because I did run out and buy the correct size from another store, however, I didnt want to have to do this when I had all the rest of my parts shipped in. Looks and fits the same for a 2000 Toyota Sienna van. I ordered extra so I will not be without any at a later date.

When looking at these products, simply calculate the actual cost per square foot. for example this"speaker kit" contains 1.38 square feet, for around 22 bucks(price fluxuates like its a stock or something?)can u think of anything thats worth 15 dollars a square foot? there are so many cheaper alternatives. dynamat is an awsome product, and it does work. but for those of us not made of money, search this "butyl flashing tape" u will be glad u did. These things are rated 8,000lbs but that's for ( GVW ) so while it's correct technically in reality each item is rated by the label at 2,000lbs per each item and if you had 4 (they sell them in pairs), if you had 4 of them you could put 8,000lbs on them, technically and according to them.****I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO RELY ON USER REVIEWS TO GET THE INDIVIDUAL WEIGHT RATING!!!!***GVW is a very deceptive and dangerous way to market and label these products.  Consider this, on a truck, the majority of the weight is on the front two wheels while the rear wheels don't have as much weight - same is true on a front wheel vehicle.  This leads to situations where you could overextend the capacity of these products.I'd like a very clear rating: 2,000lbs, 4,000lbs, 6,000lbs for each stand or ramp on Amazon so that I know how much weight I can safely put on it similar to what is found on jacks....a jack is not labeled as 6,000lbs if it can lift a 6,000GVW vehicle, 6,000lbs means that the jack can lift 6,000lbs!After all, I'm planning to get under these things!!!!On items like this where someone's life very literally depends on the labeling ---  it would be really really really nice (and a legal requirement) that the specifications on Amazon very clearly stated both the operating weight, maximium weight, and crush (failure) weight per each ramp/stand versus this GVW rating which is deceptive and just plain dangerous.I have very literally found people working underneath 8,000lbs trucks without the wheels using jack stands sold as "2ton" when in reality each jack stand was only rated at 1ton or 2,000lbs.....their comment back, "this is a 2 ton stand and 8,000lbs GVW divided by 4 is 2,000lbs or 1ton, plenty of margin."  When in reality 6,000lbs are up front....3,000lb for each wheel  and each stand rated at only 2,000lbs....making their jack stand 150% overloaded! --- horrendously scary (all because marketing is so bad in this area).  Yes people should exercise care in using double protection and users should Always read their instructions and warning before putting their life on the line -- but for the love of God, there is a responsibility on the makers and marketers of these products to label them very clearly and in bold with the weight that EACH can hold and Amazon should post that weight for each item in BOLD Yellow or Orange wording with very clear warnings.Amazon and automotive sellers on Amazon need to get on the ball regarding the needs of auto ethusiasts and for the safety of the weekend mechanic who should not have to do complex math to figure out how much weight each item can hold!We REALLY need to get away from GVW, it's deceptive and dangerous!****I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO RELY ON USER REVIEWS TO GET THE INDIVIDUAL WEIGHT RATING!!!!*** Actually I like the price best. These are usually way over priced. Here they'e just expensive. They do the job and in a year I'll let you know how they hold up. 
These hose clamp pliers are just about as good as it gets!  I use them for everything, even when I don't need hose clamp pliers.  However, they are really good for taking off the tube that connects my VW's airbox to the engine.  I don't have to get large pliers in a tight space - I just have to slide this puppy over the hose clamp, pull, and voila! Connections still tend to drip no matter how tight you make the clamps. Nothing beats a &#34;good hose&#34; with factory installed ends that don't leak.  This is used on my hose of last resort when I just can't reach the sewer drain. I hate dripping contaminated water anywhere, even if it is just grey water. I thought it had a one way valve at the tank but the sewer water was dripping from the supply hose. I can't take it out so I made a more secure fitting for the supply spot. Simple install if you don't have a closed in floor. My floor was enclosed so it took a while just to get at the tank. 
I love this tire shine, I use it every time I clean the cars. Spray it on, let it set and wipe off the excess. I do not use this as a spray and go or else it will leave a greasy film down the side of the car. Works just as described.  It does well by giving me a surface to loosen the dirt off my car cleaning brush, and it also allows the dirt to filter through and go to the bottom of the bucket.  Very tough also, a few times I have thrown the water out of the bucket after I'm done only to see the guard launched across the driveway - no harm to it, and just rinsed it off for the next use. Im writing this review because I read the negatives that some peoole have with this product. U am here to say otherwise.The first is someone stated they are having issues with this sealant causing swirls. No liquid, in any way, will ever put swirls in a car. The one product that wi is the applicator you are using to apply the product. Always make sure you have a good microfiber or foam applicator.Second, and the one people have the most difficulty with, is how hard it is to wipe this off. This is a wipe on wipe off product that applies very very thinly to your car. The proper application is to dampen your applicator with water, put some klasse in a small spray bottle and spritz it on the applicator. Then apply to a small section and immediately wipe off. The longer you wait, the harder it will be to remove.This stuff is meant to last and it does. Traditional waxes would have to be applied on the entire car and then you would wait and then wipe off. This is a sealant, it requires little time to cure or adhere to your paint.I use this and a 33oz bottle I figure will last me at least 5 years, applying one coat twice a year on a mid size sedan.Klasse is very slick. After a rainfall, the only thing that is wet afterwards is the trunk and center of the roof, as those are the only flat parts.It also gives off a great shine and lasts me 6 months with washing twice a week.If there are some spots you missed and the product has dried on or is too hard to remove, simply apply more and rub off. 
I love taking care of my vehicles.  I have used many expensive, imported products over the years.  However, Meguiar's keeps winning me back with their incredible offerings.  They are of high quality, effective, easy to find, and affordable.  However, take the affordable off.  I'd use their products, if they were 3x the price because I've used products that cost that much and are less effective.Meguiar's NXT Generation Tech Wax 2.0 highlights that experience.  I didn't want to like this wax/sealant as much as ones I paid thirty, forty, or fifty dollars to buy.  However, the results were obvious. On my vehicles, this is the best wax/sealant I have ever used.For optimum results I strongly encourage you before apply NXT 2.0, clay your car, clean with a paint cleaner (i.e. Scratch X or Deep Crystal Step 1), polish with a pure polish (Deep Crystal Step 2 or #7 Show Car Polish), and then apply this wax.  The results are truly remarkable.To maintain your shine, remove loose dirt and contaminants with Quick Exterior Detailer, or Ultimate Exterior Detailer.Meguiar's keeps delivering the good stuff, and I'm a fan. Bought Meguires and Mothers brands.  The Mothers brand is a lot better.  It gets the plastic trim back to black, and it stays that way alot longer than the Mequires brand Good cloths for cleaning autos and household items.I've never used any sorry Microfiber towels.Some are more plush than others but all will do the job.Generally speaking, the thicker they are, the longer they last and the more they will cost.For the price these cloths are good.For just cleaning our everyday drivers and two show cars, I'm lucky to wear out several a year.We even wash and also dry with the same cloths.Show Car Guys All Purpose Microfiber Towels 16" X 16"- One Of The Best Microfiber Cleaning Cloths There Is.

I bought this to change the front and rear differential in my 2006 Toyota Tacoma.  It was a much better deal to buy in bulk.  Save yourself some money and do this simple maintanece.  I went in with a friend on this pack and we both saved a ton by doing it ourselves.  Also be sure to buy a pump to easily fill the differentials.  A cheap handpump is all you need. I do love this. I took their advice and rinsed it separately from the wash water. Great mitt, and makes the job TONS easier. And when I washed it in the washer with my clothes, just the wringer cycle had it DRY! You never have enough cleaning cloths.  Now I have plenty.  Great for cleaning, and can be thrown into the washer to make them like new.  I use for waxing, and general cleanup, and they were inexpensive. 
I began with Step 1 Polish, and Step 2 Micro-Polish and Glaze, and finished up with the Step 3 Wax, using the Mothers Powerball 4Paint.  The Powerball put the wax on smoothly and uniformly, and after doing Step 1 and Step 2, my hands welcomed the break using the Powerball.  The car looks a brilliant white now.  With all the work preparing the finish, I put 3 coats of wax on it.  The car is a full-size, and there is enough Step 1 and Step 2 to do at least another car, and despite the 3 coats of wax, there is still enough in the bottle for maybe another 2 or 3 wax jobs.  Very pleased with the 3 Step process, and the Powerball. I had already used the clay bars on my Corvette to clean the painted surface then I had applied a liquid polish my Mothers and the car looked very decent. I then applied the Meguiars Gold Class wax and the results were excellent. There is a pad in the container when made application easy and I just let it dry and then took a soft cloth and removed the wax coating. The result if a very nice looking surface. I will be putting a couple of more coats on the car before I take it to the next show. I ddi this by hand and perhaps all of this would have been easier if I had an electric polisher. I am now looking for that machine. If you have never used a clay bar on your car, this is going to blow your mind.  It is very easy to use, and only takes a few minutes - but yields the most amazing results.  The clay bar pulls the dirt (after a regular wash) from the paint and leaves a totally smooth mirror-like finish.  I've been using the Mother's version for a few years and each clay bar can last a dozen or so uses before it needs to be replaced - unless you drop it on the ground.  The spray is essentially very light soap water, but it provides all the lube you need.  I usually add this into the three step process after washing and polishing, but before waxing.You will simply not belive the before and after difference you will feel when running your fingers across the paint.Also works great on glass. 
this is an excellent final coat wax for your car.  In my case I use the Meguiar's NXT polish,  wait several hours to let it cure, then apply this wax.  I use it on my car that has color (my other car is white).  Be aware, it is harder to buff this.  I maintain my cars by hand and became tired thei first time I used it.  (I washed, clayed, hand compounded, then did 2 coats of wax).  The next car I did I paced myself and washed/ compounded one day.  Then the next day I polished and waxed the car. This product still amazes me how it works, I found out about it on a chat forum and thought I'd give it a go.Small cal full of the solution in a bucket full of water, wipe on your car one section at a time, then dry it straight away and I swear to god it looks like you have waxed your car, my wife was amazed at how good it looked.  I don't know how it works but a few days after washing my vehicle it rained (like it always does) and the rain beaded on my hood and just ran off.  Excellent product. Was my first time cleaning an MAF sensor on a car. I used this product on two vehicles. Works great and evaporates very quickly so as not to leave residue. If you've never done this before, just note you have to wait a little to let the thing dry before trying to start your car once it's back in. 
I bought this due to positive reviews but never again . I leaves streaks and smudging no matter how I tried to use it even applied more than once. Tried it on window glass in the home, mirrors, and car glass, all the same result.  Really wanted it to work but plain water would do better. I rarely write a review this negative but this one earned it. Maybe its just me, but I didn't see much difference.  I have a 2010 370Z that I baby, and decided after three years it might be time to detail the finish.  As I said, I baby the darn thing so its garage kept and pretty clean to start with.  I followed the long, involved instructions written by one of the experienced reviewers to the letter. I decided to just do the hood, and then clean/wax the rest of the car for comparison. .  I could see some different in the hood.  It was definitely a higher gloss.  But not a difference that any one else would notice.  Maybe it would be more noticeable in an older car with faded paint.  But I wouldn't waste time doing this again. I also have a dark colored car that I used this on and did have some streaking. By re-applying another coat (being careful not to put too much on) corrected the problem as suggested by other reviewers. While the car really shines (I used a clay bar and detailer beforehand), the finish this product leaves is not slippery as regular waxes. This really isn't a problem, just don't expect a slick surface when you are done. I think the more I use it, the more I will like it. 
My unit did not come with any instructions.  The tool seems too complicated to be very useful, but does work. Does the job well. Comes with easy to understand instructions.Takes less than half an hour to do the job. I have completed (2-3 coats per caliper) 2 vehicles already and still have paint remaining.  This is a cheap and effective way to improve the look of your calipers.  It is imperative however to make sure the calipers are clean before application.  Fortunately this kit includes caliper cleaner (works great).  If you follow the instructions correctly (very easy to do) you'll be very happy with the finished product 
Got this because I needed a clean one so I can reuse my new differential fluid while fixing the gasket. Easy to install in 2003 grand cherokee.  I can now work under the hood and fix all the things the previous owner did not fix.  I am batman I wish maf cleaner and throttle cleaner were in one can.  But cautions are there, so I buy them separately.  I wonder if maf will clean the iat - rhetorical. 
I use this on my dark grey Ford Explorer because the Ohio license plates are white. This looks very nice on the dark vehicle and I have  not experienced any troubles with law enforcement in the state of Ohio for the shield being too dark. My Harley has a lot if black on the motor. It's a 2003 and very gradually the black will loose it's rich dark look. This product really brought back that dark rich look. I recommend it. This does not only protect, but cleans stains, road film etc. off the paint and bring its to nice clean shine. My cars have ranged from light colours (white and silver) to darker colours (red and blue) and this works perfectly to clean and protect. Sometimes, depending on how dirty the paint was,  2 applications would be done to restore the finish. Safe on clear coats and glass this is perfect. Also, one heavy shower does not remove the wax. Give it a try. 
Bluemagic Metal Polish Cream 7 ozBluemagic metal polish cream is essentially Brasso dyed blue with more abrasive content. It contains ammonia and will react with aluminum and stainless steel by developing a black oxide layer that is buffed off. It also creates a noxious gas as a result of this reaction, so I highly recommend wearing a respirator or working in a well ventilated area.The Bluemagic will not fix scratches or pitting. It will give brushed stainless a shinier luster, and it will rejuvenate polished stainless steel surfaces and chromed surfaces. I bought it mainly for my exhaust pipe tips on my cars and motorcycle. On one particular car, which has a direct injection turbocharged engine, the tips will become coated with a thick layer of soot within a few minutes of driving. This is a common problem with direct injected engines. Look at any Audi car made within the last 10 years and their exhaust tips will be coated with black soot. This is not the result of using 93 octane fuel, but rather a combustion byproduct of a direct injected engine.More and more vehicle OEMs are switching to direct fuel injection for better fuel economy, more horsepower, and better fuel metering. This means we get better engine performance, but the exhaust tips start to look nasty after a few miles. This is where Bluemagic comes in. I was able to get rid of some of the soot using regular polishing compound. However, Bluemagic got rid of all the hard soot deposits. Unfortunately, it couldn't do anything for the pitted surfaces. But it was able to get the chromed mirror-like surfaces looking better than new.On my other car, the tips just looked a little worse for wear but the mirror polished T304 tips were still in good shape. The Bluemagic shined it right up. On my motorcycle, the Termignoni tips are just brushed stainless steel but the Bluemagic made it shinier and brighter.I would recommend wearing gloves, as the Stoddard solvent smell will dig into your fingers. The black oxide residue also gets everywhere on your hands and buffing rags, so a well-ventilated workspace is mandatory.I would also recommend keeping that foam gasket in place when you remove the cap. Just lift it halfway and tear the clear seal. The gasket will help prevent it from drying out.Overall: 5/5 stars, very inexpensive solution to dirty exhaust tips and metal surfaces. cleans very well removes brake dust and stuck on grime..need to spray on and let soak scrub with brush..hose off..if stains are old or been on rims for awhile you will have to do a second clean but it will remove 95% of grime I've long been a fan of Liquid Glass LG-100 Ultimate Polish, but due to lack of supply I settled for this 3M Performance Wax. This wax is much easier to apply than the Liquid Glass & leaves no mess.  No residues, no powders & it does not stain the plastic (molding, door handle, trims etc).Only noticeable difference is Liquid Glass does leave a thicker coat of protection than this 3M; however, only time will tell which one last longer after repeated car washes.  So I will update a few month from now. 
Every person that changes their own oil needs one of these. It is a perfect fit.Simply attach a 15/16 socket to your torque wrench, attach this filter to the socket, and the rest is just as easy as can be. Perfect Mitt holds lots of water and both sides can be used as it is a flat style with cuff. This is the best stuff on earth when you need to do a repair and cannot do a proper weld. It will also stick to most anything including plastics. It is strong and can be sanded, drilled, tapped, and machined once it is set up. A must for any shop or do-it-yourselfer. 
Used this on my 2004 BMW 325Ci for my Transmission Fluid Change. Noticed an immediate difference on how the car shifts. I would recommend this product to all BMW owners Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!! I presently use this in a 2007 Dodge Nitro SXT (56,000 miles) and a 2005 Yamaha Royal Star motorcycle (shaft drive, 88,000 miles) which are both frequently operated far from population centers. I've also used this in my previous Dakota pickup truck and my Mustang hardtop, total mileage on all vehicles in excess of 500,000 miles (206,000 on the Mustang, 166,000 on the Dakota) and no problems experienced with any of them. I consider it cheap "insurance" for vehicles I depend upon to get me wherever I need to be. 
Inexpensive, yet works as good as the ones sold by Honda dealerships. Made true to specs and fits right into the slot on my Accord 2006.Will buy again. Bought this for work... do a lot of Toyota, scion, lexus oil filters... works good. nice tight fit and hasent stripped anything yet... They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. 
These filters work very well in eliminating some of the strange tastes from certan water sources.  It's difficult to judge how long to use it before replacing it, but it does work.  The Flexible Hose Protector is a piece of junk - it doesn't last that long and is difficult to use. I required an ammonia-free window cleaner for my tinted windows. This does the job quite nicely. It isn't how well it does, rather how safely it does it. the product is very easy to use all you have to do is follow the directions and that's about it it will do the rest as it say

Needed for the 2010 Toyota Sienna.  I tried some others and they don't allow you to take off the canister.  This is necessary if you want to change your own oil. MY EXPERIENCE: One of the things I really like about this funnel, is how long it is. It can literally reach down inside an automotive engine with ease, so that I can pour new oil into the crankcase, without getting it all over the engine, which could cause an oil fire!The bottom of the funnel is narrow for the first 6 inches. Which means, I can get it into a tractor dipstick tube, and effortlessly add oil. Because of the total length of the funnel, I am able to add more oil at a time, without worrying about spilling out of the funnel.Because of this same feature, I am able to put it through the filler hole of a vehicle gas tank, and it will stay there, and then I can pickup my gas can, and add a couple gallons of gas to the tank.OTHER USES: Here is another use, many of you may have not thought of. With a small mower, to drain the oil, all you have to do is tip the mower to its side, and let it drain into a pan. However, you can't do this with a tractor, because the engine is mounted to the tractor frame. So, I cant get a pan under the frame because there is my right side wheel in the way. After I attach my drain tube to the drain valve on my engine, I then take the Super Funnel, and place the tube into it, and then the funnel, into the oil pan. There you go, draining made simple!CONCLUSION: Though, I had to spend more then I would for any regular funnel, it is well worth the cost I spent on it, when I consider what uses I can get out of it. Like I said, tiny funnels are great for small things, but for larger engines, you need to get serious. I just love my Super Funnel, and if you buy one, you will too! 5 out of 5 I don't have much to say about it. Its a filter. Don't notice any extra &#34;freshness&#34; to the air. I had an old filter and it didn't smell, so this one doesn't add any extra benefit to me. I'll probably just stick to the cheaper filter next time. Definitely change these yourself. DO NOT let your oil change guys do it for you. Look up your car on Youtube and type is cabin filter replacement. I'm sure you'll find a simple step by step video on how to do it yourself. I'm guessing you'll save $30+ 
WHEN TO USE EPOXY CEMENTWhen you need a strong rigid workable (e.g. sandable and/or paintable surface) adhesive, particularly for use on metal or hard plastic, epoxy is usually the best choice.  Most epoxies dry with little running or shrinkage, and so are good for filling gaps.  The major drawback to epoxies is that they consist of two parts (resin and hardener) which must be mixed in small batches, and then applied with your own applicator (e.g., a toothpick or popsicle stick). Some are packaged in a dual-syringe--but that is not an adequate solution, because the components must still be manually mixed in order harden to maximum strength.WHEN TO USE JB-WELDJB-Weld is a very strong epoxy cement.  JB-Weld is the cement/glue of choice when joining metal parts or filling holes in metals.  Otherwise, ordinary epoxy cement or other types of cements/glues are usually better choices.  Some other reviewers have complained that the descriptive name "weld" is inappropriate---to some extent that's true.  JB Weld can do some jobs welding can't.  Conversely some simple welding jobs like joining two thin metal rods at right angles are difficult with JB Weld.HOW TO USE JB-WELDGeneral Principles: Although JB WELD makes an excellent filler---and can even be used to cast small parts, it is not remotely as strong as real metal used this way.  Whenever possible, use JB WELD as an adhesive---a very thin layer of JB WELD holding two pieces of metal together.  Always reinforce with metal pieces when possible.  For example, rather than building up a massive flange with JB Weld, you might be able to use scrap peice of metal to form most of the flange, held in place with JB Weld.  The greater the relative surface area of contact, the strong the bond will be.Surface Preparation:  As with any adhesive, the surface must be clean and rough.  Clean with a solvent (according to another reviewer, acetone is the best solvent for this purpose, but rubbing alcohol will work), roughen the surface, then clean with the solvent again.  Use a clean cloth for each application of solvent.  I generally use a small grinding wheel in a Dremel tool to roughen the surfaces.  You can also scratch the surface with a knife, or use coarse sandpaper, or both depending on the material.The solvent cleaning is for removing the LAST TRACES of oil from CLEAN surfaces.  If the parts are oily, even multiple cleanings with solvent may not be enough---you may redeposit oil from your cleaning cloth or as the solvent evaporates on the surface.  So, if you can detect any oil on any portion of the part, or if you have any doubt, clean it with a degreaser first.  If you do not have a commercial degreaser handy, a paste of laundry detergent and a stiff brush may do the trick.  Only when you are certain that there are no traces of oil is it time for the solvent cleaning(s).Joining Broken Parts: If you are joining broken parts, with a clean but irregular matching surfaces, limit the roughening to scratching with a wire brush or etching with an acid (but be sure to wash off all traces of the acid). Apply a THIN uniform layer of JB WELD, lightly clamp together hard enough to squeeze out any excess. Sometimes a thick rubber band is perfect. Often you can arrange pieces so that the weight of the top piece will hold the joint together until the JB Weld cures. Sometimes you can place a weight (such as a brick) on top to apply gentle pressure.  Do not remove the clamp or pressure until the JB Weld has cured completely.  After an hour or two, after the glue has set but is still soft, you can cut off any excess with a knife or razor---but if you don't need to cut the excess off, don't.  Often you can build-up the surfaces around a break for added strength.  Sometimes blue painters tape can be used to help hold pieces together while the glue sets, and/or to make a temporary stand to hold the pieces in the best orientation.ScotchBlue Painter's Tape for Multi-Surfaces 2090-.75A, 3/4 Inches by 60 Yards, 1 RollJoining Dissimilar Parts:  Minimize any gaps if possible, e.g., by sanding if possible so that the contact as perfect as possible.  If you will be filling substantial gaps, sometimes it is helpful to cover openings with blue painters tape to prevent the JB Weld from flowing away and leaving gaps.Joining Long Thin Parts (rods or sheets): Try to overlap if possible, or reinforce them with a similar overlapping peice of metal glued in place with JB Weld.  To join a 1/8" steel rod, to another 1/8" steel rod, forming a "T" (a common and easy welding job, almost impossible with just JB-Weld), cut two 1"-long "L's" from a heavy-paper clip, (or make L's from similar wire), and embed those with JB-Weld on opposite sides of the joint.  You can further strenthen the joint by wrapping fine steel wire around the rods holding the "L"s in place---before  covering it all with JB-Weld.  Be sure to thoroughly clean the rods and wires first (see below).  For small parts, or when wire wouldn't work well, unwaxed dental floss is remarkably strong, and can do an excellent job of reinforcing joints (when embeded in JB Weld). Ideally, apply the JB Weld, then wind the floss tightly into the soft JB Weld.Filling Holes:  Don't forget to prepare the surfaces as described above---even if you can only roughen the surfaces with an ice pick or awl.  JB Weld shrinks very little as it cures so fill the hole completely.  If it is possible to sand the surface when the JB Weld has hardened, then overfill the hole slightly.  Since JB Weld flows a little until it sets, the surface should be horizontal.  If not horizontal, you can apply the JB Weld and then cover the hole with blue painters tape until the JB Weld sets.  Depending on the job, it is often a better strategy to fill the gap as much as possible with a piece (or pieces) of metal embedded in JB Weld that a single mass of pure JB Weld.Reinforcing a leaking pipe:  Work JB Weld into a piece of fiberglass cloth or with a spatula, apply, and then add more JB Weld to any thin spots and to feather out the edges. You may have to apply several layers of the JB Weld-saturated fiberglass cloth. Sometimes wire cloth (window screening) can be used.Holes in car body panels etc:  If you can cover at least one side of the hole with a piece of sheet metal (held in place by JB Weld) that is a good strategy---the combination of pop-rivets and JB Weld often works especially well, even if you ultimately sand the heads of the pop rivets away.TEKTON 6555 Rivet Gun with 40-pc. RivetsMixing:  Follow the instructions.  A paper plate can be a good mixing surface; popsicle sticks are the best mixing tools.  Beware that you must use the same amount of resin and hardener, and they MUST be VERY thoroughly mixed.  Mix until you are certain that it is completely and thoroughly mixed, and then continue mixing for twice that time.  Seriously!!!Curing:  Follow the instructions, but wait longer than recommended: the longer you wait the stronger the bond.  A a day or two at 70 or 80 degrees is a reasonable MINIMUM.  Note that epoxies do not "dry"--there are no solvents to evaporate, instead a chemical reaction hardens the cement (a plastic resin).  Chemical reactions are proportional to temperature (the rule of thumb is that for each 10 degrees, the reaction speed doubles).  Using the rule of thumb, if it takes 1 day to cure at 80 degrees, then it takes 16 days to cure at 40 degrees, and that's only to minimally cured.  Okay, I know that waiting this long is not practical in many circumstances---you can probably get away with curing for 4 hours at 90 degrees (but don't go much higher than 90 degrees), and "take it easy" for a couple of days.WHEN TO USE OTHER EPOXIESFor materials other than metal, particularly for rigid plastics, other epoxies are usually better than JB Weld.  Some epoxies are clear, or white, or specialized for particular purposes.  For exampleCLEARBOND H-3S Clear Strong Epoxy Adhesive Syringe - .85ozWHEN TO USE QUICK-EPOXIESOrdinary (slow) epoxies (whether JB Weld or other epoxies) dry harder than quick epoxies and are generally the best choice.  Maximum strength is the whole point of epoxies--if you don't need maximum strength---you probably do not need epoxy.  Use quick epoxies when 1) the hardening speed is essential, 2) when the item cannot be supported in the required orientation while the epoxy sets (at least several hours), or 3) when you have to absolutely minimize flowage.  Super-glue is often a good alternative in such situations.WHEN TO USE OTHER CEMENTS OR GLUESWhile epoxies are ideal for a few specific uses (primarily when you need a rigid cement for metal or rigid plastic)--there are many situations when other types of glue are better choices.  Epoxies are generally NOT recommended for flexible surfaces, such as leather, wood, or flexible plastic, and generally do not adhere well to glass, etc.  While epoxies may work with porous surfaces (paper, wood, ceramics, etc.), other adhesives are usually better.White Glue: For most light-duty indoor household applications which do not have to be waterproof, ordinary household white glue is safe, cleanup is very easy, and in most cases repairs are redo-able if you make a mistake.  White glue shrinks a great deal as it dries, and so is not good for filling holes or large gaps.  For example:Elmer's All Multipurpose White Glue, 7 5/8 oz. (E379)Glue Stick: Think of glue sticks as thick white household glue in stick form.  Glue sticks are great with paper, but have few other applications.Avery Glue Stic, 0.26 oz, Pack of 6, (98095)Wood Glue: Carpenters's wood glue is essentially water-proof (when dry) white household glue.  It penetrates and strengthens the wood better than any other type of glue. It is safe, and cleanup is easy. If the joint breaks again (because the wood is weak), it can be re-glued. For example:Elmer's E701 Carpenter's Wood Glue 8-OunceGoop:  Goop will bond virtually any material, including leather, plastics, glass, and metal.  The bond is clear, VERY strong, waterproof, and hard but flexible.  Since Goop is clear, if a little extra oozes out, it is barely noticeable. I've used Goop to repair ceramic plant pots, water hoses, and shoes; to seal holes in air-mattresses, to close small holes in window screens, as plumbers paste in assembling plumbing parts, to  I also use it to seal rust spots on my dishwasher rack--the Goop it also makes a "cushioned" surface that will prevent scratches to dishes.  Goop is particular good for repairing damaged electrical cords.Amazing Goop All-Purpose Household Goop, 3.7-Ounce Tube #130012Silicon Glue: Silicon glue is best for glass, and when you want a truly flexible connection (for example, to absorb vibrations). It is a good alternative for Goop for general household use on glass, plastic, and metal when you do not need the maximum possible strength. It is safer than Goop, and cleanup is easier. Like Goop, silicon glue takes days to reach reasonable strength, weeks to reach maximum strength. For example:GE Silicone II Household Glue, 2.8 ozFabric Glue:Beacon Fabri-Tac Permanent Adhesive, 4-Ounceworks amazingly well on fabrics, saturating the surfaces enough to provide a very strong bond, but without soaking through.  Depending on the application, fabric glue can be better than sewing.  It remains very flexible, e.g., it would probably be great on leather or heavy vinyl (e.g., women's handbags, shoes, luggage, etc.)Super-Glue (Krazy Glue): Super-glue is very strong, rigid, and fast. In many ways it is similar to 2-minute epoxy---except that no mixing is required. Although very hard, super-glue is brittle, and so, is not recommended for flexible objects. Super-glue is hazardous in that it can easily glue fingers (etc.) together.  Previously, I used super-glue frequently on objects (e.g., jewelry) when a clear bond was required---however, Goop is better for such applications, safer, and more conveneient. Opened super-glue keeps poorly, even in tighly sealed glass containers---so I recommended packages of multiple very small tubes.BAZIC Super Glue, 3 grams 0.10 ounces, 6 Per PackLiquid Nails/Construction Adhesive:  When you need to permanently join a large amount of surface, of almost any kind, Construction Adhesive is usually ideal. If you need to join 2 2x4s to make a 4x4 Construction Adhesive is better than nails.  Most construction adhesives are slightly flexible, and so can even be used on leather (i.e., to repair a loose shoe sole), etc.  Construction adhesive may leave a stain on porous surfaces, and may stain-through thin surfaces.  For small projects, Goop is usually a better choice.Caulking Compound:  You can think of caulking compound as white household glue with alot of inert filler--to use when you need to fill holes.  As an adhesive, it is the weakest on this list, but is strong enough for many purposes when spread over a large surface, such as the back of a ceramic tile.  A few years ago, I made a brick column to support a mailbox.  Traditionally, I should have used mortar--which would have been very time consuming.  I could have used construction adhesive (albeit any excess that squeezed out would have been ugly)--but caulking compound was quick, cheap, looks good, and was more than adequate for the job. I've been a regular user of Permatex silicone spray for over ten years.  I use the spray mostly as preservative for rubber, plastics, and other synthetic materials, and as a lubricant for things like lock mechanisms, zippers, screws, and joints.  I apply it to the rubber hoses and sealing strips in my car, my bicycle tires, running shoes, nylon cases and luggage, and even camera gear.  Silicone is also a good electrical conductor.  After cleaning electrical contacts, I apply a little spray, which seems to improve performance and deters corrosion.Unlike CRC's silicone spray which can react with and deface and damage certain plastics, Permatex's silicone spray has never damaged anything that I have used it on.  The spray comes with a tiny plastic tube that you can insert into the spray nozzle, so that the spray can be concentrated and applied in a confined area, like the key slot in a lock.  The only real gripe I have is that the product has a tendency to foams up when sprayed, and this is exacerbated when the tube is attached.  The resulting "spray" is usually really messy, and hard to apply evenly.  Other than this, I have no major complaints about the product, which has apparently been in production for over 90 years.Silicone spray is flammable, but not exceedingly so.  Still care should be exercised in its use, and adequate ventilation should be provided.  The Permatex spray can holds 10.25 ounces, which is more than theCRC 05074 CRC product.  The Permatex spray costs about $4.50 at my local store, so you might want to check around for the best price. These are fairly solid lead cables. The cables themselves are are separate so they are an actual set or pair, where others i have worked with were still connected along the length of the main lead, each lead cable is about the thickness of a cheap USB cable.The banana clips are normal/common, the metal end is completely attached to the plastic part, i have had some where they come apart of pulled to hard, these are solid. Additionally the connection into the lead wire is very solid and non removable, i think it will hold up very well and not break lose.The alligator clip ends seem to be just fine. contrary to others results i have 2 pairs and the alligator ends are just fine, teeth all line up fine. the rubber insulator is actually fairly tight which is nice because it makes the clip easier to open and close. clips that have loose movable rubber insulator can actually be clumsy to open cause the rubber slips and slides under yours fingersOverall:Really wish they were combined leads not 2 separate wires and thicker gaugeGood cables, and i would still recommend them** If this review helped you please click the button below ** 
This is a must have product to have in your vehicle at all times. I have not tested the device and hope that I don't ever have to but it is recommended to have in your car, truck, SUV at all times. I would recommend this product to others for sure. Put these on my boat trailer for storage in the AZ sun. No complaints so far. I would recommend these. This product works great as advertised.  Be sure to constantly change or use a clean cloth.I would recommend it without a doubt. 
Fits great, and I love that i don't have to have the key in it to make it lock. I have to do that with the Master coupler and hitch lock that i use when transporting. I love this unit. Now I know in detail what's wrong with my car before I take it to the shop. This lessens the opportunity that the shop will try to upsell me on a service that I may not need. I also like the idea of being able to log the issues on my computer. I have used it on a 1993 Ford F150; 2001 Nissan Sentra; 3007 Lexus RX350 and a 2001 Cadi Deville I haven't used them yet but they look good and it will do what I need. I need to wash my car I guess

In short, I put two bottles into my car and the mileage went up about 10%, which I am very happy with.Long version:I have a 2004 Infiniti G35 Coupe 6 Speed (Manual) that now has about 76000 miles on it. The car has some modifications (cool air intake, lightweight pulleys, lightweight flywheel) that could affect fuel mileage, but theoretically they shouldn't (or at least not much). All maintenance is done on time - car is well taken care of.Either way, my car is rated to 19/26 city/hwy, and I drive a combination of approximately 35%/65% city/hwy (this is actually conservative, the highway distance is probably more), but was only managing 17.5-18mpg per tank on average. I never expect to get the full EPA ratings since I drive faster than 65 on the highway and don't have a feather light foot when driving around town, but I didn't expect it to be THAT bad.So I was reading around on the multiple car forums I'm on, and was recommended this stuff. So I went ahead and bought 3 bottles of this stuff. I put one in our truck (2009 Dodge Ram 1500 w/ Hemi) and 2 bottles in my G35 (I put one in when I filled up, and the second the next time I filled up).With my driving style being the same, my mileage has gone up now to about 19.5-20mpg, which is a pretty solid 10% increase. I held off on posting but I've put at least 20 tanks through my car since I used this stuff and the mileage increase is holding steady (if not getting better). As far as I know I have not done anything else differently that may skew my results.I haven't been monitoring the truck's mileage and since it gets driven by many different people I can't comment on the difference on that vehicle, but so far it's made a difference on my car. I'll probably end up throwing a bottle or two of this stuff into my car every 5-10K miles. Before anyone argues that you spend more money that way, at the mileage increase I got, I'm saving nearly 28 gallons of fuel every 5000 miles. Gas costs about 3.25 a gallon where I live (car takes premium) so that's over 90 bucks worth saved for spending 10-20 bucks on this stuff. Seems logical to me. I gained +positive performance, after changing my stock tires of my 2012 4x4 ford expedition from Pirelli 255/70/R18 to Michelin 275/65/R18, the car went a bit slower than before, but after I installed this filter it seems my car received more air ratio. Much better shift firmness. I am so happy and thinking to buy more stuff from K&N I didn't have any differential problems or noises that I know of in my '98 BMW 323is, but at 137,000 miles and not changed for at least 100k miles I figured I'd do this and the manual trans fluid.  I'll review the trans fluid there (Royal Purple Synchromax) since that made a huge difference.  My car runs much quieter and smoother after the fluid changes.  I can not really tell if this oil made a difference in the differential since I did several changes at once but it definitely didn't make things worse.  The old differential oil came out completely clear and was as much fluid as expected so I'm pretty sure things have been running as expected back there.After I had already ordered this I found that some BMW owners run Mobil 1 gear oil in the differential since it is said to run cooler there than RP or Redline oil.  So I could have saved several dollars per quart and maybe gotten better performance, but I don't drive the car hard so this will do just fine. 5 stars since my car is running so much better that I'll give some credit to this oil.Update 06/2012 - Several tanks of gas later and my MPG is higher.  Since I replaced the trans fluid and this at the same time, not sure which or if both made the difference.  Really improved the highway MPG, and it just did 32.09 MPG, doing the relatively flat round trip Los Angeles to Palm Springs plus some other mainly highway driving. My car has been getting 23 to 24 for the last two years and maybe 25 to 26 before that.  I've only hit 32 mpg once before in August 2009, and have had only 6 tanks of gas get over 30 mpg in the almost 12 years I've owned the car.  Stop and go driving is just slightly higher than before though as the prior three tanks of gas were 23.03 mpg, 27.38 mpg, 24.99 mpg. 
because, I have not used these yet.  I know they will be quite wonderful when I do need to use them What a load of crap. I just installed it in my 2000 civic and I did not see any REAL noticeable benefit.After all the hype about increased mileage, increased fuel economy, quicker starts, etc, etc. I have yetto clearly perceive any real benefits from using it. I paid a arm and leg for it and cannot realize itsbenefits. For civic owners you can continue using the regular NGK plugs, just change them every 8 monthsand you are good to go. I will not waste any more money on snake-oil plugs like this. I will revert to usingthe regular plugs after I have exhausted using the iridiums (since I already bought them, might as well use them). I replaced the transmission fluild on a 2003 Saturn Ion with this sythetic fluid. Saturn says that it's a lifetime fill on the transmission but I felt much more comfortable changing it out at 100,000 miles with a synthetic. I feel like I will never have to worry about it again.Just like some other people stated the old fluid did come out looking suprisingly clean. I tossed in just shy of 2 quarts of the D4 fluid and tightened everything back down. It was fast and easy to do, I used a pry between the engine and transmission to get the drain bolt. Then used loktite on the bolts going back in as the manual suggests.I could not tell a difference but my girlfriend said she could. She claimed everything was smoother. Usually she gets about 300 miles per tank and she's been getting just over that now. I can't say that's due to the fluid but it's the only numbers I can supply.I am very happy with the swap I did and I would continue to use this fluid in the future if I had an application that called for it. 
Mobil 1 0w40 has always been one of the premier products from Mobil 1.  Mobil 1 0w40 is not "just," a another viscosity.  Mobil 1 0w40 European Car Formula is actually different from other viscosities of Mobil 1 in more ways than just its weight.I often will run oil analysis on oil that comes from my cars, or even on a new bottle of oil, just to see its composition.Mobil 1 0w40 has more additives in it than say one of the more common viscosities like 5w30.The reason being is that this 0w40 product is recommended or approved by many European manufacturers who have stringent standards.  Indeed, some of these manufacturers do not only require specific performance requirements for this oil, but will actually specify where the additives packages must be purchased from.  Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, and BMW are just some of the manufacturers who have approvals on this oil.Furthermore, all AMG vehicles and Porsches come from the factory with this very 0w40 Mobil 1.  It is even used in some racing vehicles around the world.Mobil 1 does not just meet specifications, but tends to exceed those specs.Some might argue that Mobil 1 has changed its formula a lot over the years.  However, one thing is clear.  Mobil 1 0w40 is a quality product, approved by some of the most stringent manufacturer specifications, and it is the same formula found around the world.Amazon has great opportunities to have this oil delivered to your door.  There are often rebates available on the product.It's a proven product.  Recommended. Fit the application perfectly, and the car started without hesitation on the first crank.  I would recommend however that you look into the Optima website directly to purchase batteries, as they have an offer that extends their standard warranty when you purchase one of their chargers as part of the battery purchase.  You can't get the warranty if you do not purchase them together.  I'm not sure, but it does make sense that if you purchase this battery or any others in their line and you do purchase a charger in the same transaction they would probably honor the warranty extension, but I would check with them first.  The bottom line however, is that these batteries are so well made that they will probably outlast a standard battery 5 times over, so what's the logical point to extend the warranty to two years to begin with.  They're just trying to sell chargers and giving you the incentive by upping the warranty.  I'm certain the battery will far outlast that 2 year warranty.  As with all batteries, you should invest in a good smart battery charger rather than something cheap from Harbor Freight. Battery Tenders are a requirement if you want a recreational vehicle/ collector car / motorcycle battery to last through winter storage. I have used these for several years and can attest to their value.I would recommend this product for maintaining battery health. 
I bought this for my 99 ford escort lx sedan, so I could hear my sony stereo more. I followed the instructions and applied the product to my front doors. I have noticed a difference in the sound quality of my speakers. I can hear them more and there's less vibration on the doors. As far as road noise goes, it helped just a little. This product isn't made to reduce the road noise, just to help get rid of vibrations and make your stereo system louder and easier to hear on the road. The road noise level is still the same in my car. Works great, installed it on my motorcycle and also kept the high tone stock horn.  With both horns the sound is VERY loud, it will scare the crap out of any dummies that pull out in front of me now.85db stock horn91db stock horn + FiammIf you understand how decibel measurement works you will know that is a big increase in sound. 400W was more than I thought I needed, but the product works. I have not needed anything in my work truck that this hasn't handled. It also has its own fuse and proper electrical safety features Many inverters depend on the car for electrical safety, but backups are better. It also has a lot of aluminum to displace heat and never gets hot which is not true of many others either.The way I installed it, I ran a 10 gauge wire straight from the battery to its own relay to its own fuse to this device. The relay takes the signal from the stereo. That way it won't drain the battery if something is left plugged in. Many reviewers who were having problems probably had more issues with their cars than this device. If you pull it from the cig lighter, it will not give 400W in most vehicles. The car will just shut it off to prevent overheating.The only issue is when the radio turns off and cuts off the relay, this device makes an audible high pitch noise as the capacitors discharge. Its annoying but exactly what should happen. 
Seems a bit flimsy but works well .... I always hated leaving the hose in when it topped off and water spewed out I would need to run to the hose to turn it off while it was geyser of water flying out the side of my trailer .... I just wait till its full ... turn the shut-off valve off and I'm good to go wit no mess. Plus having a large valve at the end help with the hose not folding and crimping. For the price it does what it's suppose to do. I have it hooked up to the SUV.  This actually works and will kick on every other day or so just to top off the battery.  It does get VERY warm when recharging a low battery so be careful where yo set it down...8-2013 UPDATE. The button to change the type vehicle its attached to starting NOT to work, no matter how hard you pushed on the button. It was returned directly to CTEK and replaced without incident (of course I had to pick up shipping to them).. I bought this to maintain my motorcycle battery through the winter. Have ever experienced the time, and I am sure your have, when the weather nerd was wrong? It was supposed to be nice for your ride to and from work, the cold front with near freezing rain came rolling in 12 hours early, you didn't quite have the battery fully charged before you left because it would charge enough while you rode, then you got stopped by every red light on the way to work for a 10 hour shift, your bike sits 6 hours in 30 degree weather, and you come out only to hear the starter relay just click? Then your fingers are frozen and numb, and you are trying to get the tools out so you can open the cover where the battery is so you can jump it off with a car, when the rubber strap (the one that has many names) that holds the tool bag in finally pops loose and slaps you in the knuckles? Then this is the one thing a biker (or anyone with a car, truck, snowmobile that they use only occasionally) needs to keep the battery in top condition to avoid part of the scenario. It is easy to hook up, keeps the battery topped off, saves your battery, saves your knuckles, allows the people in the parking lot NOT to hear your extensive vocabulary, and is easy to use.Disclaimer:I cannot make claims to it being able to control or predict the weather, but then again neither can those college educated nerds... though some of those weather ladies can get away with anything in my book :-)I hope this review helps. 
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. This product does not fit your 2012 Toyota Tacoma! That's according to Amazon.YES, IT DOES FIT MY 2012 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab.I don't know what that white powder is on the rubber seal, but I cleaned it before installing the cap.  No error codes and no gas stolen so far. 
This Contour wiper blade is an upgrade for a beam blade or the older conventional wiper blade. My car has the conventional wiper blade. The contour blade was a breeze to install. I just removed my old blade, added the attachment to the contour blade and plugged it into the wiper arm. Took about 2 minutes.Once on, the new wiper worked great. There was no smudging at all, the blade wiped the window perfectly clean on each pass. I'll definitely replace my old blades with this type when it comes to replace them. Got this to replace the rear wiper on my 1999 Lexus RX300 and was able to replace it in a couple of minutes.  Very good value for the price paid.Here are the Valeo wipers (best), I used at the front.Valeo 900-24-1B Frameless ULTIMATE All-Season Wiper Blade - 24"Valeo 900-18-1B Frameless ULTIMATE All-Season Wiper Blade - 18" I didn't know Valeo wipers until I saw them on a deal site.  Got them on a good deal from Amazon.com.  Installed 24" & 21" wipers on my 1999 Lexus RX300 in a few minutes.  They are very quiet during operation and cleans water and snow really well compared to the OEM wipers.  I used to struggle to get the early morning frost off, but now I turn the defrost and the wipers on and the frost is gone in a couple of minutes!Valeo 900-24-1B Frameless ULTIMATE All-Season Wiper Blade - 24"Valeo 900-21-1B Frameless ULTIMATE All-Season Wiper Blade - 21"I use Valeo 900-26-1B & Valeo 900-22-1B on my wife's 2005 Honda Odyssey Mini Van and the cleaning performance is several notches better than the Honda OEM wipers.Valeo 900-26-1B Frameless ULTIMATE All-Season Wiper Blade - 26"Valeo 900-22-1B Frameless ULTIMATE All-Season Wiper Blade - 22" 
Don't buy this rear wiper for a 1st generation xB, it will NOT fit! Get OEM or a wiper from elsewhere! Perfect fit for rear wiper blade replacement on an 06 Equinox.  The opening for the J-Hook is big enough for you to slide the new wiper blade in without problems. Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. 
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars 
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. Fit my '98 Nissan Frontier's oil pan perfectly. Looks to be of nice quality.  Torque to 25ft/lbs (on the Frontier anyway) 
Exactly what was offered, fit nicely, no major prep work, won't fade or crack, adjusts perfectly, easy removal and fits under seat in truck Can't complain; it works perfectly and as advertised however, i should have done my homework.  it doesn't fit my rear disk... it only fits the front. Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. 
I have used this product when I wash and detail my car twice so far and it is amazing. Just spray it and let it be (use a brush if you want) and all of the dirty brake dust will come right off. I have my wheels plasti dipped and it did not ruin any part of the dip. I will probably buy this product over and over again. Be sure to wash your wheels before anything else! Fast shipment and great careful packaging. (You don't want these to get beat up or dropped which can cause issues after installation.) I had ordered two and probably could have only replaced the rear one on my newly used 2004 Tahoe Z71 but decided to just replace both. The front looked close to new but the rear one was in horrible shape with rust all around it. I safely vacuumed out the chamber before taking these out then vacuumed again afterwards as they top fell apart trying to get it out and from the harness falling apart as well. Oh, make sure to replace the harness while you are replacing one or both of the knock sensors it will probably need to be replaced as well. Dorman 917-033 Knock Sensor Harness is the one I bought. Don't forget to properly torque these sensors with a good torque wrench in in\lbs. Under or over torquing can cause issues. I've had these one for about 2 months now and no more light\codes or issues from the old ones. Highly recommend buying the OE ACDelco knock sensor. This was unbelievably easy to install.  I have done many different types and styles of wipers, and this was the easiest to install.  Took less than a minute per side.My complaint is that the wiper itself is very boxy and ugly.  It looks totally out of place on my car (BMW M3).  The part where the wiper arm attaches sticks up and is in my sight-line when the wiper is retracted.  The wiper itself wipes well without streaking - at least it does now that it is new - I'll update after a few months.My real complaint is that the wiper has terrible aerodynamics.  It lifts up at highway + speed  - anything over 80 MPH and it starts twitching - even when not being operated.  Makes a racket.  At 100 (on the track), it seems like it might just go flying off (I had to stop and replace with stock aero wiper arms).  It is almost useless when going over 80 in the rain, because it lifts off the windshield and makes a banging chatter.Around town and at lower speeds this is fine.  The real key to these is that the installation is so damn easy. 
Using a little Permatex Dielectric grease on the spark plug connectors will help remove them later as well as sealing out moisture. Eventually.  If the O2 sensor leaves mangled threads, this will clean them up without having to pull the manifold.  Great tool Replaced the washer nozzles on a 1999 Subaru Outback with these. They spray an even mist which I like.I had replaced the driver side nozzle years ago with parts from the dealer and the one nozzle was $20. Item was also very easy to install, hardest part is figuring out how to get the old nozzle out. In my car, once I pulled the hose off the nozzle shaft, it was just a matter of tilting the nozzle shaft forward (or backwards) and it popped right out. Hope this helps (no instructions come with the kit). 
cleans very well removes brake dust and stuck on grime..need to spray on and let soak scrub with brush..hose off..if stains are old or been on rims for awhile you will have to do a second clean but it will remove 95% of grime Does the job for which it was intended. Added to HOT water and dissolved, pour it into the base of the Air-O-Swiss humidifier to clean any 'scaling' and other 'old water' contaminants. Then thoroughly rinse (without dunking the base under water) and do this about every 2 months. A must for your RV water heater that requires and Anode Rod.  You should remove it at least once a year to be sure there is enough surface on the Anode Rod.  Will save replacing the the whole water heater if you fail to do this. A little difficult to remove and reinstall, but again worth the time and effort. 
This product works great because a) it's relatively cheap and b) gives a good shine without looking hideousBasically, it doesn't provide that ultra-greasy look you might get at a $50 detail operated by some homeless looking guy who applied a layer of grease to your tires.  Instead, you get a new-tire looking effect that simply looks good all the time.Easy to apply- just spray on.  However, make sure you try to spray on uniformly and don't put too much.  But before you do that, if you're applying this while the car is in your garage or driveway, cut up some cardboard boxes and drive over them.  This way, all the residual droplets wont stain your concrete.  Let the liquid sit for the recommend amount of time, then go out and use a paper towel to dab, not scrub, away excess dirt and liquid.  Make sure you do not leave any traces of liquid because if you do so, the next time you drive your car, centrifugal force will stream even small traces of excess liquid right off to your side panels. Trivia:  You can't have a sewer hose on the ground in Oregon.  It must be elevated!Betcha didn't know that, but what the heck!  It's always nice to have your "stuff" run downhill into the dump station instead of just sitting there in the hose!  Some people (Joe Flatlanders) carry a rain gutter to accomplish the same thing, but is a rain gutter collapsible into a nice little package with a handle?Word to the wise:  NEVER leave you black tank gate valve open!  It's ok to leave your gray tank open but NEVER leave your blank tank valve open! Dig Dig Dig and you will find Gold or you can sit down and let your Wife wash the car. well its her car. have a beer and watch her anyway you married her. 
MY EXPERIENCE: One of the things I really like about this funnel, is how long it is. It can literally reach down inside an automotive engine with ease, so that I can pour new oil into the crankcase, without getting it all over the engine, which could cause an oil fire!The bottom of the funnel is narrow for the first 6 inches. Which means, I can get it into a tractor dipstick tube, and effortlessly add oil. Because of the total length of the funnel, I am able to add more oil at a time, without worrying about spilling out of the funnel.Because of this same feature, I am able to put it through the filler hole of a vehicle gas tank, and it will stay there, and then I can pickup my gas can, and add a couple gallons of gas to the tank.OTHER USES: Here is another use, many of you may have not thought of. With a small mower, to drain the oil, all you have to do is tip the mower to its side, and let it drain into a pan. However, you can't do this with a tractor, because the engine is mounted to the tractor frame. So, I cant get a pan under the frame because there is my right side wheel in the way. After I attach my drain tube to the drain valve on my engine, I then take the Super Funnel, and place the tube into it, and then the funnel, into the oil pan. There you go, draining made simple!CONCLUSION: Though, I had to spend more then I would for any regular funnel, it is well worth the cost I spent on it, when I consider what uses I can get out of it. Like I said, tiny funnels are great for small things, but for larger engines, you need to get serious. I just love my Super Funnel, and if you buy one, you will too! 5 out of 5 I need this pump for every 100k miles when I change differential oil. There are two holes: bottom one is for oil drain and the top bolt is for oil fill. I use this pump to pump Gear oil using the top fill hole up to the point that oil will sip out. I don't think I can do it without this pump. I changed out all my rear diff fluid with this Lucas oil. I mean, its just diff oil, but with lucas, you cant go wrong: synthetic 75w140 for all temps, limited slip friction modifiers already in there, this is erfect use for those who want to do this, and not change it again in a long time.only con, the one gallon jug is kinda hard to use to fill the small fill hole without a funnel, alternaively, you can get 4 of those 1 quart squirt bottles and it would be easier. 
I came to know about this tool when I was browsing the web for finding the details how to look for Hybrid Battery temperature on my recently acquired used 2006 Ford Escape Hybrid. The forum suggested to their members thatScanGauge IIwould be the ideal choice to monitor the Motor Electronics Coolant Temp (MeC) and HV Battery temperature (Traction Battery Temp).I am pleased to inform that this tool can be configured with Ford Specific XGauges (See comments) to achieve that feat pretty easily. Ford Escape Hybrid (With Navigation) does have host of other real-time display like HV battery SOC real-time MPG on the dash but FORD hides most of the stuff from user which are needed to troubleshoot common check engine light errors and in my case why my FORD escape Hybrid sometimes decides not to turn off the Internal combustion engine (ICE) and keeps running the Radiator FANs when it should not. It baffled me for couple of weeks and led me to investigate the issue further.After setting this tool up and monitoring it for several days I could see a pattern that there are two main reason why the ICE would not shut down at idle or at a stop light. They were primarily due to 'over-temp' condition of the Motor Electronics Coolant temperature caused by a weak MCE coolant pump in conjunction with the HV battery Traction battery temperature.Replacing the nearly failed original 2006 Motor electronics Coolant Pump at 98,XXX miles (FORD OEM PART number 5M6Z-8C419-A) It did help in cooling the Motor electronics coolant temperature a little bit however the traction battery FANS are still an issue which I am continuing to investigate using this Automotive computer Gauge.FYI, There is a disturbing trend in these line of 2005-2007 FORD Escape hybrid vehicles that calls for Air-Conditioning compressor to turn ON as soon as the HV battery temp reaches 95 to 96.8 F to cool the battery using the rear air-conditioning contraption by opening the blend door and what not but as your car ages the Internal two fans housed inside the HV battery tends to fail slowly (without actually flagging any DTC codes) and thereby no matter how much AC compressor works hard (Only with ICE running) it cannot cool the HV battery enough to go under 94F for the ICE to stop at idle or at a STOP sign.It is winter here in California and thanks for mother nature my HV battery rarely calls for cooling for most of the stop and go traffic and I still have not ventured to replace the two Internal HV battery FANs (FORD OEM PART 5M6Z-10C659-A) on my Ford Escape Hybrid but I do closely monitor the temperatures using this valuable tool.Bottom line: An excellent tool to have for any gasoline or diesel engines for real-time MPG and RPM readings as well as read understand and clear (Check Engine Light) DTC codes. Well worth the price as it pay for itself in less than a year if you come across a check engine light and could decode yourself and clear it. Or just by using this tool to carefully change your driving habits and improving the gas mileage.I am amazed how crazy some drivers are who accelerate hard cut in front of you, overtake you just to stop in front of you at a STOP Light. Did you know how much Gas you could save just by decelerating slowly and watch for the traffic pattern ahead of you? - You can save nearly 30% of your gas tank not to mention less wear and tear of you brakes and other stuff when you learn to drive less aggressively.Drive safe!, Drive intelligently and save on gas!Cheers! I have used these for years on motorcycles and cars. At work these get used on floor sweepers, generators, hydraulic pumps, anything that has a battery that needs to work but may sit for a long time. Unlike most charger/maintainers, this has a de-sulfate mode that can bring back abused batteries. Sometimes you need a dedicated charger to get them going and then this to condition them. Unless you have plenty of time to spare, in which case this will eventually bring back a worn down battery. Has the common two prong connector, alligator clips to go directly to battery terminals and enough cord length to be useful. The only gripe I have is the serial number on the registration card is the same for all of them. There is a statement that I can get an LED display with registering the unit. I have done this and eventually received a display unit about 2 months later. Then I found them for $4 at Harbor Freight. For the money, these maintain your batteries and work well. They will take up space on an outlet strip though. GLAD  I  WENT  WITH  THE  CHROME AND  NOT  THE BLACK ONE, I  HOOKED  THIS ONE UP TO  MY GV1400 MOTORCYCLE IF  YOU  HAVE JUST  A  LITTLE  KNOW  HOW YOU CAN  DO  IT YOUR SELF , ALL  YOU WILL NEED TO GO WITH THIS IS A RELAY THAT DOES NOT COME WITH IT. YOU  CAN  GET IT ON HERE OR ANY PART STORE, I  HAVE MADE MANY PEOPLE JUMP  DUE  TO THE SOUND OF  THE  HORNS  LOUDNESS. 
Had to have this product to do the oil changes on my wife's 2009 Toyota Camry 3.5L V-6. Great quality! I use this in my 4-speed Harley transmission.  It is excellent oil for these transmissions, will not harm the yellow metal that is found in these transmissions. The tekton oil filter wrench is ausom. I use it for plumbing purposes,This works great on toilet bolts. I would highly recommend this to anybody who does plumbing and oil changes on there car. 
How can one really rate it, as it is used for protection and no idae how long it should last, yet is was as listed so I give it the benifit ogf the doubt... I was suprised how well and how easy they worked even on an extended van.  It saves wear and tear on the shoulders. I probably should compare it to another to see how accurate it is, but I really like how easy it is to use and turns off and on by itself. 
I installed this with a Whisper King pump and accumulator kit.  I'm not sure of how each of the components performs on their own, all I can confirm, is that when you install the Whisper King, the pump silencing kit and this accumulator, you'll achieve the performance you're looking for and the system is very quiet.  I'm guessing, but I'd say it's more than half as quiet with this set up. I installed this with a Whisper King pump and a pump silencing kit.

I was looking for a general purpose multimeter for troubleshooting the starter on my 97 geo metro, I got this and I'm extremely satisfied with the product, I was able to check the voltage of the ignition switch and found that I had a faulty starter, I was able to get theDB Electrical SMT0054 Starter Chevy Metro 1.0L 1.3L 98 99 00 01 30005925and it worked great. I was also able to test the voltage on a coin battery, this product is great! Highly recommended! 
This is a leather spray that does help keep the leather soft and looking nice. It is NOT a heavy duty cleaner thus if your leather is in really poor condition like one of my chair covers, this spray will not do the job. This works well on my auto seats and does give a good shine and soft feeling. I like the product. It is easily applied. Do not apply if the leather is really hot after sitting in the driveway as it gets sticky. I should have known better. I use Lexol leather conditioner on the leather seats in the car and leather furniture. Makes the leather very soft and pliable. Seems to work well on lighter colored leather. Note that this leather cleaner AND conditioner both discolor plastic slightly. With that in mind, as long as you're careful the conditioner makes a leather wrapped steering wheel feel great. Also tested it on a beige leather couch, the cleaner and conditioner worked nicely.For black leather (larger surfaces than a steering wheel) the conditioner proved to be a little harder to use- it left streaks unless the entire area the product is applied to is coated pretty well.Not bad, I'd probably use it again. 
Love these microfiber cloths, use it on stainless steel appliances and it leaves no streaks.Use it to clean glass and windows and no streaks.Use it also to clean and dry my car, it absorbs water well and it also dries fast.Use it with my favorite leather care lotion, the WhooHoo-CleanLeather Conditioner and Cleaner in One. Luxurious Leather Lotion for Your Designer and Fine Leather Goods. Protect Your Leather Investment. 15 FL OZ. Made in USA!, for my leather designer handbags, shoes, and sofas.I don't have to worry about scratching the leather and it washes well.I bought the pack of 3 and it's just a great value.Will continue using these microfibers. This stuff sticks and works well.  The only downside is that its hard to remove from you hands.  Best to use clear, thin gloves when applying. When washing or polishing cars, bikes, or chrome microfiber rags work the best. I use them for waxing and buffing paint and they work great. I ust to use terry cloth, the old school way. Terry cloth still left some scratches in the paint, but wasn't that bad. Microfiber just seems to do a better job all the way around. 
I tried this on my Exterior Black sidings and bumpers and it doesn't last long.  But on the interior black this product works well.  It keeps my interior black and new look.  I gave this an OK product but not really impressed with it.  Let's see how long my interior look last on this Black to Black product.  But for now it's an OK product. I own a lot of leather items from car seats to leather couches.  This product is great for both Batick type leather (laquered corrected grain) and semi aniline drum dyed leather.  The cleaner easily removes color transfer caused by blue jeans on your quality leather product.  Just be careful to rub only gently and take your time.  The conditioner is good, but I prefer &#34;Leather CPR&#34; to keep my leather items soft and pliable - also available at Amazon. I have a dark colored car, so I purchased one of those "black" tinted spray waxes which claimed it also cleans and shines black plastic and metal trim.  Wrong.  I also use a regular (not black) liquid spray polish detailer.  It's okay on regular black plastic and window trim surfaces.But neither could clean the paste wax residue ruining the look of the textured black plastic on top of my rear bumper.  But Mothers Back-to-Black certainly did.  Now my car looks showroom new again.The product is a cream colored liquid (not black).  So my product applicator (an old sock) and my wiping cloth (an old t-shirt, both from my husband) aren't stained.  I'm very happy and I would I highly recommend this product to everyone. 
I use Lexol leather conditioner on the leather seats in the car and leather furniture. Makes the leather very soft and pliable. I own a lot of leather items from car seats to leather couches.  This product is great for both Batick type leather (laquered corrected grain) and semi aniline drum dyed leather.  The cleaner easily removes color transfer caused by blue jeans on your quality leather product.  Just be careful to rub only gently and take your time.  The conditioner is good, but I prefer &#34;Leather CPR&#34; to keep my leather items soft and pliable - also available at Amazon. I use these sponges to apply leather cleaner an leather conditioner to my car.  The are absorbent and can be rinsed out for future use.  They are soft and supple and gentle on the material you are cleaning and conditioning. 
I bought this with the leather cleaner. I found it to be very good, but you have to wait for it to dry, which takes about a day. It does not stay as tacky as the leather honey conditioner which I also have bought. I feel the honey conditioner will be better in the long run, but if the leather is delicate the honey could potentially make it worse because it is very sticky and can wear the material as you rub it in. So in the long run, this is a great option. The item was just as discribed. Genuine Leather, it does fit sung. My wheel is a PT Crusier GT. It is leather, but it's starting to show wear. So I bought this to try? It was a bit hard to put on. So I laid it in the Sun for awhile. It went on. But don't add anything to help it along. You don't want it to slip. My Steering Wheel is 15", but it fits like it was made for it! My secret for keeping them looking HOT, is KIWI Black shoe polish, hand rubbed. SW In the past I've ruined leather because I was not aware that household cleaners or even other cleaners that are supposedly for leather do not have the proper pH to care for leather. They end up damaging the leather and/or soaking into the pores of the leather and clogging them, making the leather tacky and shortening the life of it.This is not the case with this Lexol cleaner. It is the correct pH so will not harm leather. Further, it seems to help feed and treat the leather as it gently cleans.I have noticed a difference! The leather seems healthier after using this product for sure. Unless I hear about something better in the future, I will swear by this stuff for all of my leather furniture and car upholstery.Note, on the bottle it states - "Not intended for stain removal." So, please don't expect this product to remove stains. It's more of a general routine leather cleaner. It does clean, because when using a white cloth, I notice some dirt on the cloth while using this.Also, a tip from a leather pro I know-wait 30 minutes after using this before applying a conditioner. This will allow the leather to fully dry. 
I ordered a set for my 2012 Wrangler but the drivers side is warped on the left side.  I contacted customer service at Husky Liner and they are sending me out a new one right away.  Happy with their service. The new liner should be ok, I hope. I use this on the back window of my Jeep Grand Cherokee. It does not flex enough to have full contact on the window. It only has about 8&#34; of contact. I will not purchase this again. Buy it and put it in.  Exact OEM replacement.  My engine had a front and back, so I replaced both at the same time. 
one way check valve. Not a real big deal.Comes with 2 hoses and clamp as pictured. I think it even comes with a sticker. What is there to say?  Comes with 5 for the spare.  Kind of sucks they never include a spare wheel key. Bottle came as described, have not had to use it, but it comes with the TPMS safe sealant in most flat kits. 
Nice high amp (current) rating on this. I epoxy it to a 12ah  12 volt gel battery and I can use it as a jumpstarter oremergency power supply for camping or power outages. After a power outage, I connected my refrigerator to this power supply. Sadly, its inverter was unable to support my refrigerator. The Duracell DPP-600HD doesn't have enough momentary  output to handle the initial start-up current spike of a refrigerator's compressor motor. The specifications say it can momentarily provide up to 960 watts. This equates to 8 amps at 120v.  Yet, public benchmark figures for a home refrigerator's start-up current indicate 13 amps for up to 1/2 second. Other appliances that use electric motors such as sump pumps are likely to exhibit the same characteristics. My suggestion is that customers immediately test this product with any device they intend to power during an outage.Some important specifications are missing in the Amazon listing.  One of the key statics is the capacity of the internal battery, which is 28 amp-hours at 12 v.  This equates to 336 watt hours.  Yet, AC output is much lower than this presumably due to inverter losses.  These losses increase with power output.  The following table illustrates this.  The last column is my calculation.load.................watts....hours....watt-hoursCordless telephone.....5........35.0 ...175Portable stereo.........10........22.0 ...220Laptop computer.......20........7.0 ....140Fan.......................100.........1.7....17036" TV...................133........1.2 ....1603/8 drill.................300........0.4 ....115Warm-air fan heater.312........0.4 ....109Blender..................385........0.3 ....109HID Floodlights.......400........0.3.....107Observe that the total energy delivered (watt-hour) drops with power consumption.  Ultimately, the usable energy is significantly less than what is contained within the lead acid battery.For reference, a refrigerator will use about 200 watts of electricity when the compressor is running. Typical consumers will have their refrigerator running about 50% to 60% of the time, which equates to an average of 100-120 watts being consumed continuously.ConsDoesn't handle current spikes associated with certain electric motorsProsBoth AC and DC outputPortableSimple operation bought this to attach to my car battery, and black and decker BM3B 6V & 12V charger.

I replace my toro mower with this oil which was recommended in the manual and for the  price it is not a bad option Purchased as a replacement for a 2004 Ford Taurus.  Lasted about 7 months before it burned out.  Replaced this item with NGK brand, OEM manufacturer.  I do not recommend this item if you plan on keeping the car. Recently purchased an USB Oscilloscope for use in my projects.  This set of test leads is worth it's cost from Amazon. I do recommend this kit. 
The grease is perfect. The thing that bothers me is that I used this one time (very gently I may add) and the tube that it's in got a bunch of little pin holes in it and now the grease leaks out in my tool box. To make matters worse, I opened the tool box the other day and the cap had split in two so now there's even more leaking out! I thought I could buy this and keep it around for future use, but now I am going to have to throw it away after using just a tiny bit on my spark plug wires. What a bummer. EXPERIENCE: JB Weld is made up of two parts, 1-parts liquid steel and 1-parts hardener. Like most strong epoxy's, you have to combined the two for the product to work. They recommend you use a clean disposable container, I used a sour cream container which I washed first.The first thing you are going to want to do before you make a JB Weld mix, is to prep the surface before application. They recommend you use Acetone or paint thinner to clean the surface, as it will not leave a petroleum film, since I didn't have any of either, I used carburetor/choke cleaner.Since the surface's were already rough, I didn't have to rough them up. However, keep in mind, if you are planning to apply JB Weld to a smooth surface, you should also rough up the surface using a fine grit sand paper as a second preparation step. I began applying JB Weld, with my cheap $1.00 painters brush from the dollar store. I applied the thick compound evenly over the entire area which meshed with the rim.Then using a piece of wood on one side of the rim, and a C-clamp, I clamped the piece on the rim with pressure and left it there for over 24-hours. After 24-hours, the JB Weld was cured and I removed the C-clamp to reveal a very strong bond! I tried to move the piece back and fourth, but it wouldn't budge, its welded like it should be!The nice thing about JB Weld, is that it can be sanded, ground down, painted, after it has been cured. I noticed JB Weld had blooped out the edges after I installed the piece. So using a dremel with a deburring tool, I managed to grind it down flush with the rim.I also used this product to seal a gas leak in the tillers carburetor bowl. It actually did as advertised and sealed the leak, there is no gas leaking out of the carb now!CONCLUSION: While I would not have believed this product could actually weld metal together, I am now a believer. If you don't own a welders kit, or have any welding knowledge, JB Weld, in my opinion, is the best product to get you out of a jam. From what I understand, this product is so good, that even mechanics admit to using it themselves! 5 out of 5! Mr Gasket chrome hex valve stem cap worked fine on my car and look good. I left the valve a little loose and put the cap on to see if the cap would seal off the leak, and it did. Great. 
Fantastic price for a very handy tool in the garage!  When working on automotive and motorcycle accessories one needs to &#34;power them up&#34; to test them or their function and this power source provides the juice required.  You can also use auto accessories having the standard cord and cigarette lighter plug, e.g. CB radio, car vac, inflator, etc.  I use mine for testing lighting and accessories I install. This is convenient and reliable power converted for those time that you need one. I have Passport radar detector with GPS that I use this to power while uploading and downloading speed trap locations from the Internet. I originally purchased this to use in conjunction with myEquus 3721 Battery and Charging System Monitorbecause I wanted to get an accurate reading of my car battery's voltage. Using that device plugged directly in the the lighter port was not accurate because my car's electrical system is all powered up along with the lighter port.I also use this adapter now when using my car vac (with engine running) as well. It can also be used with powerful air compressors that would normally blow the lighter fuse in your car as this enables you to plug those directly to the battery, bypassing the car's fuses. 
I was using this to power my Viair 00073 70P Heavy Duty Portable Compressor but with 6amp it doenst do the Job, returned it and went with Schumacher 1216 12V 15 Amp Power Converter, good to go!

THIS IS FOR LOW-POWER ITEMS ONLY!!! It is 20-AWG wire inside, barely enough wire diameter to run a 5-watt speaker. If you think you are going to plug in a tire inflator, a 1,000,000 candle spotlight, etc., you are SADLY MISTAKEN. This is NOT, repeat NOT heavy duty. It is a crime that the wire AWG (American Wire Gauge) is not listed in the specs. Otherwise, you would know that plugging in a heavy amperage load is either going to burn this up in a split second, or turn it into a heater coil and set your car on fire when you try. If you want to charge a cell phone, an iPad, etc. on it, go ahead, no problem. But the problem is, most people buy an extension cord for a cigarette lighter to do something with a heavy amp load outside of the vehicle. This WILL NOT support a heavy amp load. 
The 3rd generation powerprobe includes a number of changes for additional flexibility.  In short, it is a vehicle powered DVM with both a 20 foot cable and an additional 20 foot extension giving you a 40 foot working range around either the battery terminals or cigarette lighter outlet, both clips and a plug are included in the kit.With the series 3 units they use a hard gold plated banana jack to hold the removable probe or cables to extend your reach.  If you purchase the accessory kit, it includes piercing probes that self center on a conductor, pierce the insulation, and attach to the jack allowing you to tap a wire at any point to locate intermittant problems.While the DVM is backlit all the time, it also has 2 bright white LEDs facing forward to aid in finding and probing terminals in dark places.  The actual probe is hardgold plated with a sharp tip and removable at the banana jack.  Another identical probe is included with a screw-in female banana jack in the accessories kit to retrofit the powerprobe I and II units to accept external cables and probes.If you need to excite a circuit with a connection to battery ground or to battery positive, the switch allows a momentary connection to bridge the probe tip to either voltage which is useful in testing relay driven circuits, indicator lights, and other small current loads.  The prope voltage is always displayed during testing on the meter. The voltage/ground switch is circuit breaker protected in case you accidentally drive 12 volts into a chassis ground.  Additionally, since the switch takes abuse it is easily replaced if it fails with just a screwdriver.Combined with the testlead set, the powerprobe 3 greatly simplifies testing of vehicular wire and big rigs up to a single trailer.  The DVM has 5 selectable modes of operation designed for different problems.  Reading the manual is important to get the full value from this meter.Although the price is a little high, the design and construction quality are excellent.  Enough wire is provided to check running lights on trailers or to look for blown fuses.  All of the wiring is exceptionally flexible and heavily insulated with top quality connectors.  Both the tester and accessories come in hard plastic cases that can be stowed in a service box.Not mentioned in specifications is that although the probe runs from 12-24 VDC, the meter can be used to measure voltages up to 80VDC. There are two horns, not one. One is 400Hz and the other one is 500Hz.PIAA | Automotive Sports Horn (400/500Hz) #85110The are exact fits on the mounts as the OEM horns and use the same bolts. A 1/4 inch drive ratchet and a 12mm socket is needed to remove and install the bolt. They came with grounding leads with ring spade lugs that mounted readily under the existing M6 bolts on the radiator supports. All you need is a 10mm socket.The two wiring harness leads are too short to connect the horns. Two wire tie mounts hold the harness to the aluminum bumper reinforcement. You can cut off the ties and use the OEM harness to connect the horns, but I chose not to.  I prefer NOT to cut off the OEM connector blocks.I made two pigtail extensions out of 18 gauge black primary wire, 5 inches long. One end needs a 1/4 inch wide exposed male quick disconnect. The other end needs an insulated female 1/4 inch quick disconnect terminal. Since I used 18 gauge wire, I used the red coded ones.The exposed male connector slides into the OEM horn connector perfectly. The female one clips easily onto the positive terminal of each horn.The horns how have a weather shield on the apertures.Best thing to my surprise is that they appear to be very high quality and Made in Japan.Also nice is that they need no modification to the horn relay or circuit. The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around!

The horns were easy to install. They draw about the same amount of current as my stock horns (in the 2.5A to 3A range for each PIAA horn), so I was able to use the stock wiring, relay, and fuse instead of having to wire a separate connection to the battery positive. I used Installation Type B (two horns, each with a single wire). The stock horn positive connections plugged directly into the positive quick connect of the PIAA horns. I didn't have to cut off the stock connectors and crimp on new connectors. The stock horns use a single connection, so I ran a separate ground wire from each PIAA horn to a ground point near the hood latch.I made an inverted T bracket to hang the two horns off of the location for one of the stock horns. The PIAA horns are a bit larger than a typical stock "beep-beep" style Japanese horn, so you do have to plan ahead to make sure that you have enough room for the horns and whatever mounting bracket you may use. I angled my PIAA horns slightly outward (instead of hanging straight down) to clear an engine brace below the horns.The horns have a nice Euro sound and are suitably loud. 
These lights will be the main lighting in my Teardrop Camper Trailer when I get back to work on it next spring. They look like good quality lights and the switch works perfectly on them. I connected one of them to 12v and they are nice and bright. The diffusers are great and do a good job of diffusing the light with no lines or shadows. These lights are very light weight, but that is not a concern as I am building my Teardrop as light as possible.If you are after LED lighting, these are also a good choice because you can easily upgrade the bulb to an LED Retrofit from most any Automotive supply store, Amazon, or Ebay. They have the direct replacement LEDs for RVs for most any fixture.You won't go wrong with these lights. I installed these on my 2005 GMC Envoy XL with brush guard and they work and look great. They really light up the offroad trails and remote roads at night. I used to have the very large Hella offroad lights and these are just as bright.Installation is no more or less difficult than other lights. There's no magic here - you have to run 12V and ground to the lights, the relay, to the battery, etc. After 5 years the rear tail light bulb on my SUV went bad, I picked these up and went to replace them and found out that what my SUV came with from the factory was this exact same bulb.Replacement was a snap (2 screws and I was done).I will be frank.  I'm an avid lover of Amazon and its low prices. These were more expensive here on Amazon but if you want to avoid a trip to the automotive store or you don't have an automotive store these'll come to your door although the automotive store has the database that tells you what vehicle it fits (would be great if amazon had a similar database - hint hint).Bear in mind, these bulbs fit dozens of vehicles but you need to know the part number that you need before you order.  Also, installation difficulty also varies by vehicle.  I'm handy around vehicles and have tools so it was a pinch for me, but if you're not mechanically inclined you might just want to opt for having these replaced at a dealer.It's a five dollar job if you know what you're doing.LED CHOICES:A few things on LED lights out there.  LED lights have come a long way but by and large its hard to find an LED light that does the job these bulbs do although LEDs should last forever.  The other thing about LEDs is that they draw very little power and that can cause some problems in your vehicle.  Example, the way I knew my brake light (blinker light) was broken was that when I turned on the blinker it flashed really fast (flash flash flash flash vs flash pause flash pause flash pause)...because LEDs draw so little power, your car thinks you have a broken flash light so your blinkers could flash fast (alerting you that your blinker light is out)...some of the newer LED lights have a capacitor built in to prevent his behavior but bottom line, its hard to tell what you're getting.  I'll tell you, as soon as I find an LED light that is as bright as these bulbs, doesn't have the issues of fast flashing, and has bright lights - I will most definitely buy them primarily because LEDs should last longer than my car.  The other thing about LEDs is that they're expensive.  Bottom line, if you know what you're doing LEDs are a good option if you go find the right ones.  If you don't know your way around these newest products, go with these regular bulbsPREMIUM BULBS:In my experience they're a waste of money unless you're a car afficionado and are going for a particular look.BRIGHTNESS OF THESE BULBS:Since they were the exact same bulb that came with my car from the factory, the look is exactly the same.  Exactly the same light intensity - no more or less.  Fine by me, it's legal and bright enough.LONGEVITY OF THIS BULB:It took the set that came from the factory 5 years to burn out.  Since they're these same bulbs, I expect another 5 years from these. 
Nice high amp (current) rating on this. I epoxy it to a 12ah  12 volt gel battery and I can use it as a jumpstarter oremergency power supply for camping or power outages. We bought my dad an automatic satellite for his camper, so he would never miss his Twin's games.  The dish needed a 12v power source and this was the cheapest easiest solution for us at the time.  He just hooks this to his battery and plugs in the dish, and boom, there is his baseball game. I also bought him a 120v to cigarette converter but he uses this since it is handier. I bought an emergency power fail light at a big box store several years ago.  Recently it quit working and I traced the problem to the battery.  It was a small 6V lead acid, so instead of spending $30 for a new light I bought this battery for $10 from Amazon.  With the points from my Amazon Visa card it was free!  The new one fit perfectly and the light works again.  My home will have light when the power fails thanks to Amazon! 
Perfect for extending the cable on anything that plugs into your cars OBDII port. I'm using it for my power programmer since I can see the readouts while I'm driving. At the end of the day if you're not using this for audio or video all that matters in the price.. and this is great in that category! I bought this to power cordless battery chargers and small bathroom appliances for camping.  One problem.  The manual clearly states it should not be used for any of those purposes.  Testing it with a DeWalt battery and charger confirmed this.  The DeWalt charger indicated a power failure and would not charge.From the manual."Certain chargers for small nickel-cadmium or nickel-metal-hydride batteries can be damaged if powered by this inverter. Two types of appliances are susceptible to damage: Small, battery-operated appliances such as flashlights, cordless razors and toothbrushes that plug directly into an AC receptacle.* DO NOT use this inverter with the above two types of equipment.""Some inexpensive audio systems may produce a slight "buzzing" sound when operated with the inverter. The only solution to this problem is to use a sound system with better power supply filtering.""In no event will PowerBrightTM be responsible for any amount of damages beyond the amount paid for the product at retail."Online descriptions, including the manufacturer home page, give no indication of the above important information.If you are looking for an inverter for the above purposes you will want to look into a PURE sine wave inverter.  Make sure you also review the power requirements on your device before you buy the inverter as well.  Underpowered inverters can be harmful to your devices. We bought this for our RV (2008 Mercedes Sprinter chassis) and it works great.  I can see how many miles are left until an empty tank, watch the mpg, monitor engine temp, and lots of other things.  Be sure to read the manual for how to calibrate your mileage readings.  We mounted the ScanGauge on our dashboard using the provided velcro strips.  That approach was okay, but I would like to find a sturdier way to mount it.  If you're handy, you can mount it on your dash and run the cable through the insides to get to the OBDII port.  You have the option of having the cable connected to the ScanGauage either on the right side or out the back.  No additional electrical source is needed, since the OBD port is powered. 
The installation of the SG2 is simple: attach the OBD2 connector to the DLC port and attach the RJ-45 jack to the SG2 unit. Routing the cable is really up to the operator. I chose to do it in a crude manner because I don't plan to make it a permanent addition to the car. I zip tied the cable to my HVAC vents and anchored it to the empty traction control hole behind the glove box.I used 1 of the provided velcro kits to affix the SG2 to the top of my steering column so that it is right below the instrument panel. It actually blocks my view of the shift indicator array, although I can still see it clearly if I lean forward.The update rate set at FAST is still rather slow and that is to be expected with the outdated OBD-II network. The "fastest" aftermarket scan tool that I have seen is SCT's Live Link for Ford / GM / Chryslers. If you want anything faster, you are going to have to borrow an OEM's scan tool system.The X-Gauge interface is a bit cumbersome since you are restricted to using 2 buttons to enter alphanumeric characters while if you pause for anything more than 10-15 seconds, the SG2 shuts down. According to Linear Logic, they are working on an updated SG2 with datalogging features so hopefully they incorporate a PC interface to speed up programming and setup times.I have it set to monitor instantaneous MPG, RPM, Vehicle Speed, and a gauge that I frequently switch depending on my mood. I am monitoring the torque converter slip ratio. Whenever it reads below 1.00, it means the torque converter is "slipping". Above 1.00 means the output side of the converter is spinning faster than the input side and theoretically it could just mean engine braking with some torque converter slip. You can program custom X-Gauges to monitor gross engine horsepower or torque input at the transmission.I had previously used a Garmin Forerunner 101 to check my GPS vehicle speed and compared it to my speedometer readout (2000 Ford Crown Vic with mechanical speedometer). It revealed that my GPS speed was about 2-3 mph slower than the speedometer indicated speed. The SG2's vehicle speed readout (from the Vehicle Speed Sensor PID in the OBD-2 system) is approximately 2-3 mph slower than the speedometer reading and I am assuming this is the same readout as my GPS (I didn't get a chance to verify this yet).Some of the gauges I like to monitor are Coolant Temperature, Intake Air Temperature, Transmission Fluid Temperature (XGauge), Torque Converter Slip Ratio (XGauge), Gross Horsepower (XGauge), RPM, Vehicle Speed, and MPG.I still haven't been able to figure out how to work the trip computer properly to display averaged fuel economy. The instantaneous MPG is more important to me because I want to see if anything is not working right on long cruises. I have often wondered if the torque converter was locking properly when I use cruise control or when cruising on the highway.The data collection stability is impressive. I never ran into many problems with Car Code or SCT's Live Link, but SG2 is just more convenient and compact. The backlight colors are interesting as they allow you to choose 4 different values of each RGB component (or 64 possible combinations). I have it set to R=3, B=0, G=0 so that it resembles Pontiac's interior lighting (I drive a Ford).My only real complaint is that there's not a better way of attaching the SG2 to the car. A suction cup mount for the windshield would come in handy since I could mount it near my line of sight without relying on adhesive-backed velcro. The interface is quite intuitive but I would have liked a way to program the X-gauge more easily, like via a PC interface.Bottom line: The SG2 is a great deal if you are interested in data readouts for your car. There are cheaper ways of pulling DTC codes, so the only real usefulness of SG2 is the "realtime" PID monitoring and the trip computer for cars that do not have such devices. If you know someone who is a bona fide gearhead and drives a car made in 1996 or newer, they may appreciate the SG2 as a gift.UPDATE:While the ScanGauge II provided a useful feature for cars without trip computers or onboard monitoring for various PIDs, I have noticed that it began to malfunction more frequently. The gauge readouts began to "flicker" between PIDs. For example, monitoring IGNition, the IGN began to switch rapidly between HPR. Just recently, the entire ScanGauge II shutdown while I was driving. It would refuse to reconnect with the OBD2 network. When it did find a connection, a lot of the text was garbled and it lost all of my trip data except for the total mileage. My car normally maxes out on 300 miles per tank of gasoline, so I was bewildered when the SG2 said I drove over 4000 miles. Other SG2 readers have reported similar quirks, albeit not as serious as the self shutdown and data corruption that I experienced.Many newer cars already have features built-into the car. The Pontiac G8, and Nissan GT-R are two examples of cars that have very developed "trip computers" while many other modern vehicles like the Pontiac G6, have trip computers that can monitor most of the fuel-related data. First off, let me say that I am highly doubtful that this pump could possibly reach 300psi.  It's a cheap auto pump equipped with a cheap, dim safety light.  The digital pressure gauge doesn't seem to work at all.  Mine jumps around from 14psi to 98psi in moments. If you want to use the digital display more than once, you have to unplug and replug the unit.  Stupid.  There are much, much better products out there.  Keep looking. I've owned several cheap multimeters over the years. Craftsman, RadioShack, and a Sinometer to name 3 more recent ones. All failed to compare to this, even though the Sinometer and Craftsman (was a gift) were more expensive. To compare :* The craftsman was decent - but it kept blowing fuses, didnt have auto-ranging, was bulky, didn't include side holsters for the probes like this, and eventually I cracked the lcd screen from dropping it (could still read off it). Measuring AC voltage with this one it's generally within 0.05v the same.* The RadioShack had a horrible shell, no auto-range, button cell batteries, had no amperage measure features, and was usually off 1+VAC or 1% of the Craftsman. Never could rely on that.* The Sinometer was decent at first but I had issues with the auto-ranging. It kept jumping around when measuring stable voltage. It was usually within 0.1vac of the Craftsman.* My Killowatt also measures VAC - and it is off about 0.5v from the Craftsman and this (reads low). Pretty sure the Killowatt is just incorrect, I've never had anything read as low as it for VAC.* Lacrosse AA/AAA battery charger measuring voltage of batteries - the readings are always within .01vdc the same.* The final comparison is with my Velleman oscilloscope: I tend to think this is the most accurate voltage measuring device I have and a good benchmark for VDC. This unit is usually within 10mV of that measuring sub 12v sources.So you can see everything has a bit different readings, there are few things I trust when I need to get an absolute accurate reading. Now the list includes this, the velleman, and probably any fluke.Besides accuracy and comparison other features of this :* Hard rubber corners to survive a drop in just about any direction.* Side holsters for probes* 10A DC and 200mA AC mode* 1.5v 6v 9v 12v battery tester mode* Auto-ranging - if you don't have a meter with this feature it's really convenient* Continuity testing mode* Ohm resistance measuring* Auto off if left onI don't have a fluke to compare the readings too - but I have previously with my oscilloscope and it was as close to a reading as this was. If I used a multimeter all day for my job - then I'd probably invest in a 75-250$ meter like fluke. However for 15$ this unit definitely blew me away. You can't go wrong with quality and accuracy at this price. 
I have tried several chargers and this one is by far the best one I could find with the least amount of  flaws.Pros:Light weightClamps are better than mostStores cables inside unit5 year warrantyCharges batteries fast and completelyCons:Cooling fan runs all the time while plugged in and hits case when unit is movedDisplay is always onFan is noisyShould not leave unattended over night or more than two hours at a time We have cars with full of electronic gadgets so they consume significant electricity, even when car is being driven. Almost every week we get no start due to weak battery. I have an external car battery charger (old). It is bulky to setup to charge cars overnight. Also it does not have any detection, so the battery can be continuously overcharged, which will eventually damage the battery (as multiple battery experts tell me). Never learned our lesson as we had 3 quality batteries purchased and replaced - each within 2 years.After reading all the great reviews, I bought one of these on-board charger and installed in one of the car that frequently dies (even with new battery). Now I can just plug in to the wall when car is parked each night, and unplug in the morning before the commute. No need to check if charging is complete if not driven for days! Also it will reduce the risk of not able to start the car to almost none.I will be buying another one for our other electronic gadgets-heavy car...  The next convenient thing is to find a good retractable power cords that can either be installed in the car with the on-board charger, or to the outlets for which the charger will be tapping power from. I have a couple of motorcycles that I ride regularly and one of them, a HD V-Rod, will drain the battery even with the key removed from the ignition. This is due to the multiple sensors that the bike relies on to monitor things long after you've stopped riding for the day. The coolant system is a good example as the radiator fan may need to kick in and stay on for sometime after a hot day's riding. Plus the alarm system and TSSM draws power even when the bike is off... and it does so all night!I went through several years of foolishly planning on riding only to find the bike's battery had drained and the familiar click-click-click sound of not enough power to engage the starter motor. I would then trickle charge the battery for a few hours and finally head out on my way. Of course, this meant I was going through batteries at a rate of about one every 16 months. At $100+ a pop it just didn't make sense to keep doing this and so I sprung for the dual Battery Tender from Deltran.The tender itself comes with two tails which are supremely easy to hook up directly to your battery and it also comes with two sets of crocodile clips which can connect to the tails so you can charge or jump your vehicle without having to remove seats or side panels to access the battery.The tender box itself is small and has sufficient LED status displays so you know if there's an issue with the set up (red=bad, amber=tendering, green=good to go kind of thing). Do note that a battery with less than 3 volts will not work with a battery tender - a tender is not a charger in the traditional sense, instead it monitors the battery's state and gives it a little juice if needed. If your battery is completely flat you will need to charge using a standard charging system before tendering it.I'm very happy with this tender - I bought it in 2008 and have yet to replace the V-Rod's battery. That's three years now - so the tender has paid for itself and will continue to do so for years to come. If you have a motorcycle, especially one used only during the fair weather days, then you should definitely pick up a battery tender and I recommend this dual one for functionality and price. 
After a power outage, I connected my refrigerator to this power supply. Sadly, its inverter was unable to support my refrigerator. The Duracell DPP-600HD doesn't have enough momentary  output to handle the initial start-up current spike of a refrigerator's compressor motor. The specifications say it can momentarily provide up to 960 watts. This equates to 8 amps at 120v.  Yet, public benchmark figures for a home refrigerator's start-up current indicate 13 amps for up to 1/2 second. Other appliances that use electric motors such as sump pumps are likely to exhibit the same characteristics. My suggestion is that customers immediately test this product with any device they intend to power during an outage.Some important specifications are missing in the Amazon listing.  One of the key statics is the capacity of the internal battery, which is 28 amp-hours at 12 v.  This equates to 336 watt hours.  Yet, AC output is much lower than this presumably due to inverter losses.  These losses increase with power output.  The following table illustrates this.  The last column is my calculation.load.................watts....hours....watt-hoursCordless telephone.....5........35.0 ...175Portable stereo.........10........22.0 ...220Laptop computer.......20........7.0 ....140Fan.......................100.........1.7....17036" TV...................133........1.2 ....1603/8 drill.................300........0.4 ....115Warm-air fan heater.312........0.4 ....109Blender..................385........0.3 ....109HID Floodlights.......400........0.3.....107Observe that the total energy delivered (watt-hour) drops with power consumption.  Ultimately, the usable energy is significantly less than what is contained within the lead acid battery.For reference, a refrigerator will use about 200 watts of electricity when the compressor is running. Typical consumers will have their refrigerator running about 50% to 60% of the time, which equates to an average of 100-120 watts being consumed continuously.ConsDoesn't handle current spikes associated with certain electric motorsProsBoth AC and DC outputPortableSimple operation Nice high amp (current) rating on this. I epoxy it to a 12ah  12 volt gel battery and I can use it as a jumpstarter oremergency power supply for camping or power outages. I use this power adapter to test equipment (small tire air compressor, USB Power Adapters) along with charging batteries in my home. This Power Adapter is made of good quality and has lasted over 2 years without any problems. Well worth buying.

Haven't used it yet because I'm still looking for the interface to hook on my buffer wheel...I bought something for that and I'm still back to &#34;square zero&#34;...you would think that in the marketing of this sort of product the seller would fill in the gaps on the other things you need to hook everything up. Not sure I can use it without buying a totally new buffer (which I really don't want to do, since I just bought one). If you already have a hook and loop wheel on your buffer, this product may be just fine. I haven't used them yet but they look good and it will do what I need. I need to wash my car I guess Haven't had a chance to use this grease gun but It looks to be perfect for the application I need it for.  It looks like it will be able to shoot lube up in some real tight places.  I am really excited to use this but I think I will stop before i get too graphic.  I am batman 
I'm on my 3rd bottle of this stuff. It does the job for me. There might be a better product out there but every time I run out of Black-to-Black I just buy another bottle. It works so why should I try anything else? Ok, that's a bad attitude. When I use up all the product in this bottle I'll try something different. Maybe. I would not buy this product again. It does what it should but If I had to do it again I would just stick with detaling microfiber towels from Viking/Cobra. I was excited to get this kit, thought it was a good deal and it was nice I didn't have to select each component separately.  I still think it is a decent value but some of the products aren't great in my opinion and I will be replacing them with others.Clay bar system:This worked great.  Got a good amount of contamination out of/off my paint.  Really made a noticeable difference and I will continue to use it.  Once it is used up I may try a different brand but not because this didn't work well, mostly because I like trying out different stuff to find my favorite.Wash mitt, wax applicator, microfiber towel:These are both fine, nothing out of the ordinary.  I think it would have been nice to include two wax applicators though.  The towel could be larger but overall it is good for wiping the wax off.Car wash:This works well, it is not strong enough to get really stuck stuff off (bird poop for example) but overall it works well.Wax:This is probably the one I like the least.  I don't know why but for some reason it worked very poorly on my black car.  It leaves almost a oil slick appearance (that sort of rainbow look you see with oil in water) to the paint after I use it.  I did used it on my girlfriends car and it worked well on that so I am not sure if it is just a black car thing or what.  It does seem to last decently but after a few weeks the car looses its slick finish and appearance.  I will be switching to something else here for sure, I think I am going to try some Blackfire Wet Diamond based on reviews around the internet.Tire gel:This one is also not very good.  I put it on my tires and they look the same as they did before I put it on.  Waste of time in my opinion.Scratch x and plasti x:I have not had a chance to use these yet.  I might give them a try but I will probably switch to more professional grade detailing products for these tasks.Overall I think the kit is ok for people who want to casually detail their car.  I want to get more serious so I will be switching to more professional grade products overall.  Some of the stuff like the clay bar and the wash are fine and I will use those up before switching.  Other stuff like the wax I will just save and use on my girlfriends or parents cars. 
I use this to open my screen door without having to to open the sliding panel to reach inside to open the door.  Keeps bugs out while making the door easier to open from outside. i use this lube all around the house....door hinges, oven hinges, key locks, sliding door tracks etc.works nicely and doesnt leave a visual layer....dries invisible This device attaches securely to the tow vehicle, but at a cost.They are cumbersome to attach and detach, with several moving parts and the potential to scratch the tow vehicle paint during either process if you don't have three hands available.To attain the secure vibration free fit, you must crank down on the ratcheted web strap hard enough to deform the door where it attaches to the window channel. It also deforms the rubber window seal.Foam pads protect the door somewhat where the bracket would otherwise rub on the body, but if the area isn't meticulously clean beforehand I can see where it would dull the paint over time.Because of the metal claw part that fits into the window channel, raising and lowering the window caused a screeching sound on my driver's side window.Finally, when they are detached from the door, they make for a very bulky awkward device that doesn't store conveniently or compactly in the vehicle.I'm sending them back. 
stellar product for polishing, cleaning and keeping the bike looking great. She works on the engine, paint, fiberglass, plastic, chrome and anything else on the bike. DO BE CAREFUL SPRAYING ON THE SEAT OR TIRES I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND. This product doesnt come off too easily and will spread with heat. If you spray on the tires or seat it will look great but your butt and the bike will slide everywhere. This is one of my favorite wheel cleaners. It cuts the brake dust and dirt with ease without damaging your wheels. Works well on any finish like including alloy, chrome and even black wheels.  All wheel cleaners are not created equal. This cleaner will clean very gentle so no damage occurs. The Quik Interior Detailer is a great product from Meguiars. This provides the finish I like on my interior (not too glossy, but a nice clean matte finish).This interior detailer spray also has a nice smell to it. Safe for all surfaces (vinyl, leather, plastic, chrome, navigation/entertainment consoles and LCD screens). 
This hitch extension is &#34;adjustable&#34; because it has two holes on the &#34;male&#34; end of the receiver, and two holes on the &#34;female&#34; end.  Depending on how you insert this extension into your vehicle (hole one or two), and how you insert your bike rack or whatever else into the &#34;female&#34; end (hole one or two), there is some adjustment on how much extension you achieve.  In theory.I was hoping to use the SMALLEST amount of extension with this so that I'd achieve about 7&#34; of extension.  I needed to extend my Thule T2 bike rack just enough to clear a larger-than-factory Jeep tire.i am able to use the hole that positions this extension furthest into my Jeep (so the &#34;male&#34; of this extension is adjustable).  Unfortunately, I was not able to utilize the deepest hole in the &#34;female&#34; end of this extension because there is only about 2&#34; of space between that deeper hole and an internal ridge where the inside square bar is welded to the outside square bar.  Hard to describe, but essentially my Thule bike rack it the back of this extension before the holes lined up with the deepest hole in this extension.So.. I suppose you could blame that on my bike rack?  In hind sight though, I wouldn't trust any bike rack that only had that little amount of metal behind the holes--just not enough there to handle the load.  No.. I think that this extension could have been better designed to just have ONE hole on the &#34;female&#34; end, but position it somewhat in-between the two that it currently has.  I doubt that there are many racks out there that could utilize the deepest hole in this extension's &#34;female&#34; side...One additional comment.. I read some reviews that criticized the welds.  I am not a welder, but in my observation, the welds seem smooth and uniform all the way around this.  I must say that the metal is a little thin compared to other extensions that I've seen.  I think it's quite fine for any 2-bike rack out there, and I'm using it for that.  When I set up to carry 4-bikes, I do worry that this may snap though, and I am pursuing another extension for that reason.Conclusion:  If you are only carrying 2 bikes, and you are happy with the extension possibilities IGNORING the deepest hole in the &#34;female&#34; part of this extension, I recommend it.  The price is reasonable and the integrated locking bolt is really nice (especially if you buy their optional locking bolt.)If you want a very short extension, this probably won't work.If you plan to carry 4 bikes, I don't know if this is strong enough.  I'm using it for that occasionally, but I'm a little worried about it... I bought this cable chain for my 2005 Honda Odyssey with tire size 265/65R16 in 2008 and have been using every winter.  Practice once before you have to do it under snowy conditions.  I found out the hard way that it's difficult to put even the easy to put chains, if you haven't read the instructions.  I can get the chain on now in under 5 minutes on both the tires.  Slide the chain under the tire and hook up the bottom (split end), then proceed to do the top inside and outside, followed by the rubber tensioner and you are good to go.  Reverse the install and the chain will be off in a couple of minutes!  Before I got this chain, I used to struggle with the chains that require you to lay it down straight, drive over (with someone helping) and make the connections. it's usefully to get a wire off the ground, but it's pretty thick, and it set up for round tube, like a class III/IV, and not a square class I so it wasn't going to be easy to install, and be functional. i ended up installing the plug in trunk, and will have to have it come out that way, disapointing, but it works better that where i'd have to put it.it's easily 2x the thickness of the plug, and 2x as long. the plug will stick out a bit. if i had round tube, a self tapping screw would have worked well. 
How can one really rate it, as it is used for protection and no idae how long it should last, yet is was as listed so I give it the benifit ogf the doubt... Not only do they not fit, very thin and wonder how long they will last.  Also if you have batteries with the post and screw/nut the latter is not covered. I was suprised how well and how easy they worked even on an extended van.  It saves wear and tear on the shoulders. 
These plugs work great on smaller tire holes. The plugs themselves are fairly expensive though and not too robust (the brass end pieces will fall off if the plug is not installed perfectly, then you start over with a new plug). I use them only when I've got a small tire hole. They say you can put multiple plugs in larger holes, but at that point you should use the larger rope type plugs. I have two cars, both of which require the large #14 sheet metal self-tapping screws to mount the plate to the nylon retainers behind the plate (the ones mounted on the car that the screws screw into). Problem is that diameter of the plastic ring that holds the screw covers is too small to take the screw's large diameter head. The maximum screw head diameter that will fit the ring is .435 inch (11 millimeters). Option 1: Replace the nylon retainers on the car, but different cars have different retainers so one must search for new ones that will accept a #12 screw. Option 2: Try to find #14 self-tapping screws with smaller heads. I shopped around for #14 screws with smaller heads to no avail. Option 3: Grind down the screw head's diameter. Option 4 (not good): On one car I used #12 sheet metal screws that have a smaller diameter, but DO fit the rings, and wrapped the threads with tape. This sort of works, but I really can't tighten them down satisfactorily. So I have to check their security now and then. I'm leaving the other car as is for now. Maybe someone has more practical ideas? Sure would like to hear of them. BTW, SEE THE UPDATE BELOW.UPDATE 11/16/13:I think I've found a viable solution to the above problem. I used a #12 sheet metal self-tapping screw, placed a 1/2-inch long piece of ordinary shrink tubing (1/4" i.d.) over the threads towards the pointed end of the screw. Used a heat gun (or you can use a match, BIC lighter or soldering iron) to shrink the tubing which effectively increases the thread diameter to about that of a #14 screw. This allows me to tighten the screw securely and will last much longer than ordinary tape. One more thing: The THICKNESS of the screw head doesn't quite allow the chrome cap to fully snap into place over the nylon ring. The top of the head needs to be filed down a little leaving enough Philips "X" to use the screwdriver. Worked well although they were just a bit bigger than my old ones.  Have to be careful when removing the grate for cleaning as you can push them through the hole if you rush.  Fine material that should last a long time. 
It's simple and effective.  You easily get an accurate rating on your spark plug gap, and you can use the hole to pry the electrode open if need be.  Very convenient tool to have if you're a Do-It-Yourselfer. This buffer has plenty of power to get the job done, and appears to be well worth the money.  Some minor assembly is required.  There is a `manual' but it does not contain any instructions, instead it mostly covers general safety.  Assembly is fairly simple.  You first attach the curved top handle, either with or without, the straight side handle.  The handle can be installed for either right or left hand operators.  The buffer is top heavy, so installing the side handle is highly recommended.This unit comes with the accessories to get started right away.  For buffing, it has a wool pad, and rubber backing pad.  For sanding, a Velcro backed hard plastic disc is included, but you will need to provide the sandpaper inserts.  A special wrench for locking down the rubber backing pad is included.Controls are pretty basic.  There is a throttle switch on the bottom of the handle, with a lock button to keep the motor running.  The speed control dial is on the top of the housing, and goes from 1 to 6 (maximum).  The buffer starts to whine at around level 3, and gets screaming loud at full speed, when ear protection is definitely recommended.  The amount of vibration will vary according to the task, and motor speed.  When sanding or buffing fine dust is typically produced, so you may want to wear eye protection and a dust mask.If you are into weightlifting, using the buffer on a vehicle may not be too difficult, but for those not so physically fit, managing the weight and vibration, could be a challenge.  Because of the tool is about 18 inches long, your hands end up positioned about a foot apart, in order to keep the torque generated by the buffer under control.  Just a little inattention can result in losing control, or dropping the buffer, and you don't want to hurt yourself, damage your paint job, dent your vehicle, or damage anything else.The supplied wool buffer is quite thick, and does a pretty good job, but you do need to apply pressure for it to work.  For the average sedan, buffing the hood and trunk should be the easiest.  Things get harder when you do the sides, or curved or irregular surfaces, and have to both support the weight of the buffer, and apply pressure to the surface.  Buffing non-flat areas usually requires changing angles, and varying the point of contact, and amount of pressure applied.  Users will need to find the grip and techniques that work best.  Buffing will require some finesse at times, and if your muscles are straining, this is when accidents can happen, or you can hurt yourself.  Doing the roof can be tricky as well.The listed weight of eight pounds, may not sound like a lot, but if you are bracing your body, locking your forearms, and squeezing hard on the handles for an extended period of time, you may find your muscles a bit sore, or in `shock' from the vibration, if you overdo it.  Just go easy when using it for the first few times.The pictured buffer has a blue plastic housing and black handle, but the unit also comes with an orange plastic housing.  It has a ten foot cord with a twin blade plug, and comes with a set of spare brushes.  The buffer does produce very good results, so if you have a strong back, and the upper body strength, it could be a very cool buy. This isn't going to be used with a nail gun , but it works well for tires . It's not the fastest, but it works . It threads on  to the valve so you don't have to sit there and hold it down . This way you can get to a safe place if your on the side of the road 
a regular 32mm socket will not fit in the space of my equinox. this is a kind of shorter 32mm socket designed only for oil filter cap job. it works fine. It's a great product, however, it would not fit my Honda Shadow VT750 disc brake.It supposedly has 10mm holes in the disc brake, but for some reason the pin just won't fit!Otherwise it looks like a good product!I've used the 5mm pin for my scooters; however my motorcycle now has to do without lock. There are two horns, not one. One is 400Hz and the other one is 500Hz.PIAA | Automotive Sports Horn (400/500Hz) #85110The are exact fits on the mounts as the OEM horns and use the same bolts. A 1/4 inch drive ratchet and a 12mm socket is needed to remove and install the bolt. They came with grounding leads with ring spade lugs that mounted readily under the existing M6 bolts on the radiator supports. All you need is a 10mm socket.The two wiring harness leads are too short to connect the horns. Two wire tie mounts hold the harness to the aluminum bumper reinforcement. You can cut off the ties and use the OEM harness to connect the horns, but I chose not to.  I prefer NOT to cut off the OEM connector blocks.I made two pigtail extensions out of 18 gauge black primary wire, 5 inches long. One end needs a 1/4 inch wide exposed male quick disconnect. The other end needs an insulated female 1/4 inch quick disconnect terminal. Since I used 18 gauge wire, I used the red coded ones.The exposed male connector slides into the OEM horn connector perfectly. The female one clips easily onto the positive terminal of each horn.The horns how have a weather shield on the apertures.Best thing to my surprise is that they appear to be very high quality and Made in Japan.Also nice is that they need no modification to the horn relay or circuit. 
Didn't last very long in the Florida sun.  Not impressed with any of the Rain-X products.  Wouldn't buy again. Prood that a good marketing plan can sell even an inferior product! The quality of this tool is very good and it hasn't fallen apart or given me any issues yet.If it does I will update my review accordingly.My only regret is that it's not made in the USA. Not much to say, it either works or it doesn't.... this product is not rocket science and does what it claims. 
used this stuff to clean my carpet on my 2006 Jeep tj worked great on carpet and upholstery. cleans and brighten seats. mothers is the best. cleans very well removes brake dust and stuck on grime..need to spray on and let soak scrub with brush..hose off..if stains are old or been on rims for awhile you will have to do a second clean but it will remove 95% of grime This does not only protect, but cleans stains, road film etc. off the paint and bring its to nice clean shine. My cars have ranged from light colours (white and silver) to darker colours (red and blue) and this works perfectly to clean and protect. Sometimes, depending on how dirty the paint was,  2 applications would be done to restore the finish. Safe on clear coats and glass this is perfect. Also, one heavy shower does not remove the wax. Give it a try. 
How can one really rate it, as it is used for protection and no idae how long it should last, yet is was as listed so I give it the benifit ogf the doubt... Sorry to say, I  have never used the sewer hose support as of yet.  So  I can not really say how good it is. I guess it is a great hose support if you have to use it.  Sorry, can not say how it works Never used one of these before so and the instructions are a little confusing so I did not know how to use it. I looked up YouTube and found out how to use it and it works fine. 
You have to try this stuff.  I've been using it for years on my dark cars and it really leaves one of the best squeaky clean feeling deep shines you will find. It seems to make the swirl marks and small  scratches just disappear.  I cover with a good synthetic wax.  Great product, easy to use. One bottle goes a long way - I use 1/4 or less on a large full size car. I was so glad to find it on Amazon. I use Permatex regularly, especially on lug bolts. It is economical and this size container is especially handy to have. Remember to stir the contents well and use only a very small amount. I tend to use a disposable acid brush for application, rather than the lid mounted brush. In fact, I tend to remove the included brush and prefer to just have the lid as a lid.  It has never failed me. I would use a copper based product for exhaust work, but this works well for all other fasteners. It also cleans up easy. We have mostly all started to convert to LCD's and Plasmas at some location in our homes...whether its for TV or computer.  Well, there are a few ways to clean them....buy a LCD cleaning kit which costs $$ or find a better cheaper and similar solution.  Well I did just that.These microfiber wipes not only help you clean a CAR.....they help you clean your flat panels without any liquid.I have been using one to clean an LCD panel that sits in our Family Room....it gets dusty in there....  This puppy grabs all of the dirt and the best part is there are NO smudges.Now I know sometimes we get stuff on our screens that needs that essential liquid touch....for that you should find a small bottle of liquid lcd cleaner so u can use it when necessary.Regular cleaning with these will get the dust off and not scratch the surface.UPDATE: 03/13/09 - Friday the 13thThese continue to amaze me in my office and in my home.  I work for a medium sized company in IT and we have switched away from other types of fabric/paper cleaners to these Microfiber cloths.  We use them on all of our LCD screens and on our larger then life Plasma displays.  It has been months and I have yet to hear a complaint and or see a SCRATCH.  THESE are perfect and a great value.  Also...lets not forget the GREEN aspect of these....36 of these can probably replace hundreds if not thousands of paper towels....save paper...save trees.  Simple Concept. 
Love these microfiber cloths, use it on stainless steel appliances and it leaves no streaks.Use it to clean glass and windows and no streaks.Use it also to clean and dry my car, it absorbs water well and it also dries fast.Use it with my favorite leather care lotion, the WhooHoo-CleanLeather Conditioner and Cleaner in One. Luxurious Leather Lotion for Your Designer and Fine Leather Goods. Protect Your Leather Investment. 15 FL OZ. Made in USA!, for my leather designer handbags, shoes, and sofas.I don't have to worry about scratching the leather and it washes well.I bought the pack of 3 and it's just a great value.Will continue using these microfibers. I use these sponges to apply leather cleaner an leather conditioner to my car.  The are absorbent and can be rinsed out for future use.  They are soft and supple and gentle on the material you are cleaning and conditioning. I dont like the thick gel type dressing as they are prone to sling all over the side of the car.This product is thin enough that you can apply evenly using a simple foam pad.  I can achieve a nice natural finish, or very glossy by adding more product. 
This scratch remover seems to be more of a polish  and lube that will remove the surface scratches for the paint. It does not appear to have any &#34;grinding&#34; type ingredients in the paste.It will have little of no impact on deep scratches or deep nicks in the paint. It is easy to out on and remove and will a decent job for those light scratches. It did not remove any discoloring on my paint such as a stain left by a bird dropping. It ddi make the blemish lighter though. The chair rolls easily and is well constructed. The pad is thick enough to make sitting on it comfortable. I use the chair often while waxing or detailing the sides of a vehicle which is hard on my back and knees without the chair. Doesn't add too much of a shine on the surfaces you apply it on, its just right and leaves a clean/streak free finish.  I use this on the non-leather surfaces in my car and on the black trim on the outside of my car 
The carpet adapted just like the instructions said, fit the step perfectly and does a good job of keeping sand and debris out of the camper. The inside of the camper stays a lot cleaner because you can wipe your shoe soles off before entering. And the color matches the interior colors. Not to remove scratches, but to conceal and and make look presentable. It works well and does what it is supposed to do. Great for light scratches. Harder to use on black cars, but with a little patience it works well. The dash of my black car is anthracite gray, and it shows dust easily. The California duster is created for either exteriors or interiors of cars and is impregnated with paraffin wax. This picks up the dust and the soft fibers float over the uneven surfaces of the car interior, picking it all up in one swipe.I keep this in the car and once a week I swipe down the interior all over to keep the car sparkling clean. It's small enough to keep handy under the seat.This makes a really nice gift for someone to congratulate them on their new car, or for someone who likes doing their own detailing. 
stellar product for polishing, cleaning and keeping the bike looking great. She works on the engine, paint, fiberglass, plastic, chrome and anything else on the bike. DO BE CAREFUL SPRAYING ON THE SEAT OR TIRES I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND. This product doesnt come off too easily and will spread with heat. If you spray on the tires or seat it will look great but your butt and the bike will slide everywhere. The product works very well based upon condition of your interior. It will not make your car new, but it does work. Hope this helps. Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.  The pickle fork is the last resort for me, as it will damage the balljoint boot.I prefer to use the Snap On balljoint remover.  If that one cannot fit, then I will try this tool.  If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork. 
I have been using this product for years.  It's a liquid cream stays emulsified and spreads very easy.  After it dries to a haze it wipes off even easier.  As a cleaner wax it's fantastic.  Removes everything that has accumulated on your paint and leaves it shiny, sealed and smooth.  I use it on our Murano, F150 and camper trailer.  I'll never use anything else. Worked wonders on old, old dried in dirty grease. I wanted this to try to clean a rug I have that I haven't been able to use for years. It is a super thick, tightly woven 100% wool rug with a great kitchen design of fruits and veggies in full color on a black back ground. Well.....9 years ago I spilled an entire vat of hot dirty deep fat frying grease on it and it completely soaked through. I also got very sick about that time and didn't get around to trying to clean if for at least 90 days and the grease had dried into it. I tried saturating it with other cleaners and Tide ans Wisk laundry detergents hoping it would get the grease out but it didn't. I didn't have the heart to throw it out so I held onto it all this time and I'm glad I did. That little throw rug cost $190 and I sprayed enough of this KRUD on it so it soaked through out the rug, let it sit for a few hours and all I did then was scrub it lighlty with a toilet bowl brush and it got all the grease loosened up and then I rinsed it out in the tub. It took a few days for it to dry because it is that thick but now I have it back in the kitchen and am loving having it back...... I then tried to remove old dried in yellow oil stain that had come from my washing machine when I washed too heavy of a load so the oil came from the machine and got into my favorite powder blue sweat shirt, and again, I tried Tide, Wisk and other cleaners and they didn't get any of it out, I sprayed KRUD on the spots, let it soak in and left it for an hour, then rinsed it out and the stain was gone....I'm thrilled. Between the rug and the sweatshirt this KRUD has saved me $230. They should call it "GOLD" not KRUD. I'm going to buy it by the gallon so I always have it on hand. You should too. I'm in love with Grez Off!  Like another reviewer  here,  I use it for many tasks!  It does more than dissolve grease!I especially love it for removing grease spots from laundry.  We love to cook and I am forever in battle with stubborn grease spots on shirts.  It does not discolor clothes.My makeup bag seems to always turn into a mess with hard to remove eyeliner pencil gunk getting all over my tubes and bottles of makeup.  I use a dry terry cloth and spray a little Grez Off on each container such as mascara,  mineral makeup,..etc.  then wipe.  The Grez Off takes it right off and cleans the inside of the bag when nothing else will!  If you are a lady and use makeup,  you know how troublesome it can be to clean your makeup bag and wipe your makeup containers clean.  (unless you are a super neat nick and they never get grimy)I use it to clean out my bathtub also.  It's strong and I wear a face mask...but boy does it do the trick,  and does it fast!  Much easier than using scouring powder or spray bathroom cleaners such as Dow.  This product seems to just melt the scum off and leaves the tub really shiny with little effort from me.  So really it's more than just a degreaser!I haven't made it out to the garage yet to try it on oil spots,  but watching the video that a gentleman posted in his review,  it's plain to see that he did not leave the product on the concrete nearly long enough to reach the soaked in oil.When I get around to using it on concrete oil spots,  I will spray the spot,  cover it with plastic so it doesn't dry,  and let it sit overnight or so before I attempt to scrub and rinse.  I have faith that it will do just as great a job on those tuff garage floor spots if given time!  It cuts through grease like lightening but concrete grease soaks way down,  so my guess is it just needs more time and maybe that's why some people aren't seeing the results that they could have.The price of this product is also very economical compared to other products,  especially when purchased in the 12 pack that Amazon offers. 
Works Great all you have to do is just spray it on and that's it , it foams up and lubes the seals . I use this degreaser in the shop for small oil drip and spills. The spray works fast and allows clean up with paper towels. The lack of hazardous chemicals and odors makes it safe to use in the house as well. Good value for the money. I used this on the front carpet in the car.The stuff works.. It removed &#34;ALL&#34; whatlooked like permanent stains with 2 applicationsone on top of the other. 
The products included in the kit are highly rated car care products. The variety of uses combined with the manufacturer's reputation make this kit a good value. I was seeking a method for referencing the specific parking location for my Mercedes Sprinter and Moetefindt trailer in my airport hangar.  Searching the offerings of Amazon.com produced this wonderful product which is incredibly substantial.When using these chocks as a target, I am able to precisely direct each vehicle to the location where it should be.  Also, they let me know when the tire contacts the chock, which doesn't move, so I know the vehicle is then &#34;at home&#34;.This is a highly recommended product! As with all lexol products...excellant quality and serves my needs extremely well.  I highly recommend all of lexol products. 
Armor-All is a miracle worker for tired, dried, old upholstery. It cleans, seals, protects, covers scratches, and makes leather and vinyl look new again. I've been using it since the early 1980s, and highly recommend it.  I use it on the seats, dash, inner doors, and even on the tire sidewalls.  I've also used it on leather and vinyl purses, an office chair, and leather book covers.Just spray, let it soak in, then wipe it off well.  If you buff it, it doesn't leave an oily residue or any odor.  Don't use it on any place that would be a slipping hazard, like floors, because it does leave a slippery finish.Try Armor-All and you'll be amazed at how great your car seats can look! Doesn't add too much of a shine on the surfaces you apply it on, its just right and leaves a clean/streak free finish.  I use this on the non-leather surfaces in my car and on the black trim on the outside of my car The leather sofa, love seat, chair and ottoman were faded and looking rough. One bottle of Lexol restored them to new condition. I cleaned some worn and stained areas with a good saddle soap with a day to dry. Then in one day I was able to go over the furniture with one coat. Use a dish sponge with the blue scrubber top. Use the sponge part, not the scrubber. The scrubber worked well with saddle soap to clean.Let dry for a day. Repeat. Expect the leather to darken. The white stains are curing salts that have worked their way out of the leather. They melt with the Lexol and return into the leather.The result is a buttery soft leather that looks great. 
Let's start off by examining the product claims made by the manufacturer, since some people seem to think that those of us who aren't fans of this product are at fault for expecting it to live up to those claims:* Cleans and lubricates the fuel system* Cleans and lubricates the carburetor and injectorsThese are the words of Lucas Oil Products (on lucasoil.com), not me.  So, if you want to lambaste me (or us) for expecting this product to clean our fuel systems, you will have to first explain why we should not expect it to, given that the manufacturer says it will.Sea Foam Motor Treatment is claimed by the manufacturer (on seafoamsales.com) to:* Cleans internal fuel system components* Clean carburetors, fuel injectorsDo you see the (claimed) overlap between the Lucas and Sea Foam products?I bought a couple 5.25-ounce bottles of this stuff for my car, which had a very rough idle.  Certain that all the positive reviews couldn't be wrong, I also bought a gallon of it at my local auto parts store (fortunately, I got a steep discount).I put one bottle through the fuel system.  No improvement.  Then another bottle.  Still nothing.  No noticeable improvement whatsoever.Eventually, I tried Sea Foam Motor Treatment, and with one bottle of that, got the results I was after.  No, I didn't mix the products.As far as I am concerned, this product is positively useless for cleaning the fuel system.  &lt;-- And is "cleaning the fuel system" a stated product claim?  Yes it is, thanks for asking! This product, Chevron Techron fuel system cleaner, and CRC Guaranteed-to-Pass fuel system cleaner are the only products that have been proven with results to work.  Redline makes incredible products, especially their transmission fluid. I have been washing all my cars for years with Turtle Wax Car Wash and have always been satisfied with this Turtle Wax products.When I bought this product, Turtle Wax ZIP CarWax, I was really disappointed about its wash performance :- the &#34;concentrate&#34; in the bottle is very watery to begin with; no comparison to Turtle Wax's original ZIP car wash- even though I used 1 fl. oz. (~ 30 ml) with a bucket of water this product does not generate any suds- because of this it is tough to get grime and dirt off; you have to scrub really hardI am baffled that this product has so many positive reviews; maybe Turtle wax recently has changed the formula for this product, and I got the newest version. 
I own a lot of leather items from car seats to leather couches.  This product is great for both Batick type leather (laquered corrected grain) and semi aniline drum dyed leather.  The cleaner easily removes color transfer caused by blue jeans on your quality leather product.  Just be careful to rub only gently and take your time.  The conditioner is good, but I prefer &#34;Leather CPR&#34; to keep my leather items soft and pliable - also available at Amazon. I use Lexol leather conditioner on the leather seats in the car and leather furniture. Makes the leather very soft and pliable. Armor-All is a miracle worker for tired, dried, old upholstery.

Use this when washing your car, glass will come out much more clear, and no more water marks or swirl marks. I love this tire shine, I use it every time I clean the cars. Spray it on, let it set and wipe off the excess. I do not use this as a spray and go or else it will leave a greasy film down the side of the car. I did not buy this at Amazon, cheaper elsewhere.This wash mitt was nice & thick. Holds a lotta water/suds...could do the whole roof with one dip into the soapy water.You can see the dirt on the mitt as you wash so you know when to dip into a bucket of clean water before returning to the soap bucket for fresh suds.Microfiber can really get the dirt off easily and the thickness doesn't scratch your paint.I bought a case of 6 mitts from an online dealer for $20 
I will keep this simple. If you want to have a "Wet Look" paint finish, this can help you achieve that.  This is how I got my 3 year old car looking like a show car.1. Wash you car with Meguiars Car Wash.  Make sure to get all the dirt off.  Dry thoroughly.  I use a super absorbent chamois to speed up the process.  Make sure to do this in the shade.  The car's surface should be cool to the touch.2. Use the Meguiars Claybar. Keep going until your hand glides on top of the paint.  This will give your paint a glass smooth finish.3. Apply Meguiars Paint Cleaner with a Random Orbital Buffer or Meguiars Buffer.  This will remove any stains and very fine swirls.4. Apply this Mirror Glaze with the Random Orbital buffer.  Wipe off and buff using a Microfiber Cloth.5. Apply your choice of Meguiars Waxes with the Orbital buffer.  I personally prefer the Meguiars NXT wax because I dont have to wait long after applying the wax before I can wipe off and buff.6.  Maintain this new finish by using the Mequiars Ultimate Quick Detailer often to clean any dust,tree sap or bird droppings that may land on your car. The Detailer will keep it lookng great and also extend the UV protection.You just need to do this entire process once or twice a year.  Regularly, you just need to wash your car at least once a week.  And you can re-apply Meguiars wax once a month or as often as you like as their waxes do not damage your clear coat.  That is why I only use their products. I have always been a fan of handwashing my vehicles but over the years I have sometimes come across the problem of leaving small scratches or swirl marks on the surface due to dirt/grit staying on my wash mitt/sponge. After purchasing two grit guards for the 2 bucket wash method, I couldn't be happier!By simply running your wash materials over the guard, it loosens up the dirt and debris removed from your car, sending it right to the bottom of the bucket. This allows you to get a clean mitt every time and it keeps the dirt from landing back on your car.If you are a fan of washing your car and keeping it looking new like I am, I would suggest picking up a grit guard or two. Your car's finish will thank you for it! I began with Step 1 Polish, and continued with the Step 2 Micro-Polish and Glaze, using the Mothers Powerball 4Paint.  The Powerball saved my hands, and this Micro-Polish and Glaze made the white surface of my car reflect like a mirror.  You can't see the micro scratches easily on a white car, but you could see how smooth the surface was, and you could feel it.  I followed up with 3 coats of the Step 3 wax, and the car looks showroom new.  There is enough left in the bottle, after doing my full-size car, for at least another full-size car.  Good value! 
I have a Porter Cable 7336SP dual action polisher with the backing pad and the Meguiar's 6.5 inch pads fit perfectly and securely. I like these pad very much. I use Meguiar's Ultimate Polish with this pad to remove minor swirls and minor scratches on the clean coat of my car. I place product on the pad, lay it on the car and turn on the polisher so as not to sling product. The Porter Cable 7336 polisher is not the most powerful, so when I first begin polishing, the machine rotates the pad when I don't add much pressure. However, as the product becomes loaded with wet polish, the pad begins to drag and loses its rotation. It helps that the pad is not &#34;so&#34; thick and that the edges are tapered. I've solved the problem by having a second pad to change out to finish the second half of the vehicle. The pads are easy to clean and I let them dry with the Velcro pad facing up. I am pleased with the results. I use these sponges to apply leather cleaner an leather conditioner to my car.  The are absorbent and can be rinsed out for future use.  They are soft and supple and gentle on the material you are cleaning and conditioning. Great cover! I put it on in minutes after delivery and warming a little, and it is not moving; low 80's outside today but likely over 110F in the car. I do not have sweaty hands and it does not look like color came off. It is smooth leather and is dyed black, much like belts and shoes, which can rub off on contact (belts do after repeated hand-contact and probably stain the inside of belt loops without our knowing). For those with sweaty hands get a rubber-cover with grips (stinky) or vinyl (slippery) but neither are very durable in hot cars; you won't be as happy with the comfort unless it is leather. Non-leather will smell toxic or be slippery, but it will not bleed color. If your hands sweat they may slip on vinyl or smooth rubber. This product has a great grip and feel and leathery smell.There is an inner rubber-sleeve )non-smelly) that prevents the cover from moving. I set the product in the sun for about 5 minutes and it made it ply-able enough to work it on. I recommend starting with the center-most seam on top of a straight wheel(there are 3 seams at roughly 12,4,8 O'clock), carefully work the outer edge over the wheel and down both sides evenly (the first 3/4's is easy), use patience and care, then roll the edge into position. If it is off-center it cannot be slid sideways. Take it off carefully and begin again with it more centered and work each side evenly; a little here, a little there. Do not put this on cold or stretch without warming; it can damage/crack/tear cold leather.I placed this on a 15" 2008 Chevy Aveo5 steering wheel (do measure your wheel diameter before ordering). The only con to these types of covers is they cannot wrap the inside, so the fingers feel the outer edges of the cover; in this case it is smooth, rolled, and well stitched and I have gotten used to it. It is probably made in China at this price but it looks and feels like good quality. I recommend this and would choose to buy again and recommend to a friend. I also recommend a little leather conditioner on this, much like one would use on leather car interiors. It is smooth leather, not suade or roughened.In 'the old days' I bought wrapped 'stinky' vinyl, and used vinyl to thread through holes and wrap around the cover with tension (still available) and it filled the inner part of the wheel. It was difficult and time-consuming, and, the vinyl strings eventually breaks. I recommend this 'new and improved' version. Rubber and vinyl degrades in heat and UV. Did you know that wonderful 'new car smell' is highly carcinogenic, expecially when hot, and all the glue they use on carpeting and interior fabric, also. This has been well known and accepted for over 50 years but it sells cars. FYI. 
Use with mitten and warm to hot water following a good high pressure hose down. Let it sit a minute on surface then wipe with soapy mitten. Hose off. I use very warm to hot water with very little of this concentrated soap. Always wash when your car surface is as cool as you can get it in the warm months. I have shade which works best but not essential. I use this grit guard to wax my car using 2 bucket method. The grit guard works very well. If your car is very dirty, using this guard would be a big plus Great way to protect your gauge - A MUST HAVE EXTRASome reviewers have commented on this being difficult to fit.The leaflet recommends use of silicon spray, however even easier with hot water.1- Bowl of HOT (not boiling but HOT), leave the cover sitting in the hot water for a good 5 minutes.2- Rub a few splashes of water around the gauge.3- Take the boot out of the water (keep it hot and wet).4- It will then slip straight on, just wipe off the water and then let it dry.JOB DONE !Just remember to use some thread tape or sealer when re-fitting the hose. 
This is a leather spray that does help keep the leather soft and looking nice. It is NOT a heavy duty cleaner thus if your leather is in really poor condition like one of my chair covers, this spray will not do the job. This works well on my auto seats and does give a good shine and soft feeling. I like the product. It is easily applied. Do not apply if the leather is really hot after sitting in the driveway as it gets sticky. I should have known better. I use Lexol leather conditioner on the leather seats in the car and leather furniture. Makes the leather very soft and pliable. Seems to work well on lighter colored leather. Note that this leather cleaner AND conditioner both discolor plastic slightly. With that in mind, as long as you're careful the conditioner makes a leather wrapped steering wheel feel great. Also tested it on a beige leather couch, the cleaner and conditioner worked nicely.For black leather (larger surfaces than a steering wheel) the conditioner proved to be a little harder to use- it left streaks unless the entire area the product is applied to is coated pretty well.Not bad, I'd probably use it again. 
This is designed to work with the Valterra bayonet fitting on your Gray or Black water dump valve and it does just that... Not to remove scratches, but to conceal and and make look presentable. It works well and does what it is supposed to do. Great for light scratches. Harder to use on black cars, but with a little patience it works well. The lock it self looks like a quality built.  Heavy and shiny.  But sadly, it does not fit my 2004 Honda VTX1300c on either rotors.

The white stains are curing salts that have worked their way out of the leather. They melt with the Lexol and return into the leather.The result is a buttery soft leather that looks great. 
Let's start off by examining the product claims made by the manufacturer, since some people seem to think that those of us who aren't fans of this product are at fault for expecting it to live up to those claims:* Cleans and lubricates the fuel system* Cleans and lubricates the carburetor and injectorsThese are the words of Lucas Oil Products (on lucasoil.com), not me.  So, if you want to lambaste me (or us) for expecting this product to clean our fuel systems, you will have to first explain why we should not expect it to, given that the manufacturer says it will.Sea Foam Motor Treatment is claimed by the manufacturer (on seafoamsales.com) to:* Cleans internal fuel system components* Clean carburetors, fuel injectorsDo you see the (claimed) overlap between the Lucas and Sea Foam products?I bought a couple 5.25-ounce bottles of this stuff for my car, which had a very rough idle.  Certain that all the positive reviews couldn't be wrong, I also bought a gallon of it at my local auto parts store (fortunately, I got a steep discount).I put one bottle through the fuel system.  No improvement.  Then another bottle.  Still nothing.  No noticeable improvement whatsoever.Eventually, I tried Sea Foam Motor Treatment, and with one bottle of that, got the results I was after.  No, I didn't mix the products.As far as I am concerned, this product is positively useless for cleaning the fuel system.  &lt;-- And is "cleaning the fuel system" a stated product claim?  Yes it is, thanks for asking! This product, Chevron Techron fuel system cleaner, and CRC Guaranteed-to-Pass fuel system cleaner are the only products that have been proven with results to work.  Redline makes incredible products, especially their transmission fluid. I have been washing all my cars for years with Turtle Wax Car Wash and have always been satisfied with this Turtle Wax products.When I bought this product, Turtle Wax ZIP CarWax, I was really disappointed about its wash performance :- the &#34;concentrate&#34; in the bottle is very watery to begin with; no comparison to Turtle Wax's original ZIP car wash- even though I used 1 fl. oz. (~ 30 ml) with a bucket of water this product does not generate any suds- because of this it is tough to get grime and dirt off; you have to scrub really hardI am baffled that this product has so many positive reviews; maybe Turtle wax recently has changed the formula for this product, and I got the newest version. 
I own a lot of leather items from car seats to leather couches.  This product is great for both Batick type leather (laquered corrected grain) and semi aniline drum dyed leather.  The cleaner easily removes color transfer caused by blue jeans on your quality leather product.  Just be careful to rub only gently and take your time.  The conditioner is good, but I prefer &#34;Leather CPR&#34; to keep my leather items soft and pliable - also available at Amazon. I use Lexol leather conditioner on the leather seats in the car and leather furniture. Makes the leather very soft and pliable. Armor-All is a miracle worker for tired, dried, old upholstery. It cleans, seals, protects, covers scratches, and makes leather and vinyl look new again. I've been using it since the early 1980s, and highly recommend it.  I use it on the seats, dash, inner doors, and even on the tire sidewalls.  I've also used it on leather and vinyl purses, an office chair, and leather book covers.Just spray, let it soak in, then wipe it off well.  If you buff it, it doesn't leave an oily residue or any odor.  Don't use it on any place that would be a slipping hazard, like floors, because it does leave a slippery finish.Try Armor-All and you'll be amazed at how great your car seats can look! 
Use this when washing your car, glass will come out much more clear, and no more water marks or swirl marks. I love this tire shine, I use it every time I clean the cars. Spray it on, let it set and wipe off the excess. I do not use this as a spray and go or else it will leave a greasy film down the side of the car. I did not buy this at Amazon, cheaper elsewhere.This wash mitt was nice & thick. Holds a lotta water/suds...could do the whole roof with one dip into the soapy water.You can see the dirt on the mitt as you wash so you know when to dip into a bucket of clean water before returning to the soap bucket for fresh suds.Microfiber can really get the dirt off easily and the thickness doesn't scratch your paint.I bought a case of 6 mitts from an online dealer for $20 
I will keep this simple. If you want to have a "Wet Look" paint finish, this can help you achieve that.  This is how I got my 3 year old car looking like a show car.1. Wash you car with Meguiars Car Wash.  Make sure to get all the dirt off.  Dry thoroughly.  I use a super absorbent chamois to speed up the process.  Make sure to do this in the shade.  The car's surface should be cool to the touch.2. Use the Meguiars Claybar. Keep going until your hand glides on top of the paint.  This will give your paint a glass smooth finish.3. Apply Meguiars Paint Cleaner with a Random Orbital Buffer or Meguiars Buffer.  This will remove any stains and very fine swirls.4. Apply this Mirror Glaze with the Random Orbital buffer.  Wipe off and buff using a Microfiber Cloth.5. Apply your choice of Meguiars Waxes with the Orbital buffer.  I personally prefer the Meguiars NXT wax because I dont have to wait long after applying the wax before I can wipe off and buff.6.  Maintain this new finish by using the Mequiars Ultimate Quick Detailer often to clean any dust,tree sap or bird droppings that may land on your car. The Detailer will keep it lookng great and also extend the UV protection.You just need to do this entire process once or twice a year.  Regularly, you just need to wash your car at least once a week.  And you can re-apply Meguiars wax once a month or as often as you like as their waxes do not damage your clear coat.  That is why I only use their products. I have always been a fan of handwashing my vehicles but over the years I have sometimes come across the problem of leaving small scratches or swirl marks on the surface due to dirt/grit staying on my wash mitt/sponge. After purchasing two grit guards for the 2 bucket wash method, I couldn't be happier!By simply running your wash materials over the guard, it loosens up the dirt and debris removed from your car, sending it right to the bottom of the bucket. This allows you to get a clean mitt every time and it keeps the dirt from landing back on your car.If you are a fan of washing your car and keeping it looking new like I am, I would suggest picking up a grit guard or two. Your car's finish will thank you for it! I began with Step 1 Polish, and continued with the Step 2 Micro-Polish and Glaze, using the Mothers Powerball 4Paint.  The Powerball saved my hands, and this Micro-Polish and Glaze made the white surface of my car reflect like a mirror.  You can't see the micro scratches easily on a white car, but you could see how smooth the surface was, and you could feel it.  I followed up with 3 coats of the Step 3 wax, and the car looks showroom new.  There is enough left in the bottle, after doing my full-size car, for at least another full-size car.  Good value! 
I have a Porter Cable 7336SP dual action polisher with the backing pad and the Meguiar's 6.5 inch pads fit perfectly and securely. I like these pad very much. I use Meguiar's Ultimate Polish with this pad to remove minor swirls and minor scratches on the clean coat of my car. I place product on the pad, lay it on the car and turn on the polisher so as not to sling product. The Porter Cable 7336 polisher is not the most powerful, so when I first begin polishing, the machine rotates the pad when I don't add much pressure. However, as the product becomes loaded with wet polish, the pad begins to drag and loses its rotation. It helps that the pad is not &#34;so&#34; thick and that the edges are tapered. I've solved the problem by having a second pad to change out to finish the second half of the vehicle. The pads are easy to clean and I let them dry with the Velcro pad facing up. I am pleased with the results. I use these sponges to apply leather cleaner an leather conditioner to my car.  The are absorbent and can be rinsed out for future use.  They are soft and supple and gentle on the material you are cleaning and conditioning. Great cover! I put it on in minutes after delivery and warming a little, and it is not moving; low 80's outside today but likely over 110F in the car. I do not have sweaty hands and it does not look like color came off. It is smooth leather and is dyed black, much like belts and shoes, which can rub off on contact (belts do after repeated hand-contact and probably stain the inside of belt loops without our knowing). For those with sweaty hands get a rubber-cover with grips (stinky) or vinyl (slippery) but neither are very durable in hot cars; you won't be as happy with the comfort unless it is leather. Non-leather will smell toxic or be slippery, but it will not bleed color. If your hands sweat they may slip on vinyl or smooth rubber. This product has a great grip and feel and leathery smell.There is an inner rubber-sleeve )non-smelly) that prevents the cover from moving. I set the product in the sun for about 5 minutes and it made it ply-able enough to work it on. I recommend starting with the center-most seam on top of a straight wheel(there are 3 seams at roughly 12,4,8 O'clock), carefully work the outer edge over the wheel and down both sides evenly (the first 3/4's is easy), use patience and care, then roll the edge into position. If it is off-center it cannot be slid sideways. Take it off carefully and begin again with it more centered and work each side evenly; a little here, a little there. Do not put this on cold or stretch without warming; it can damage/crack/tear cold leather.I placed this on a 15" 2008 Chevy Aveo5 steering wheel (do measure your wheel diameter before ordering). The only con to these types of covers is they cannot wrap the inside, so the fingers feel the outer edges of the cover; in this case it is smooth, rolled, and well stitched and I have gotten used to it. It is probably made in China at this price but it looks and feels like good quality. I recommend this and would choose to buy again and recommend to a friend. I also recommend a little leather conditioner on this, much like one would use on leather car interiors. It is smooth leather, not suade or roughened.In 'the old days' I bought wrapped 'stinky' vinyl, and used vinyl to thread through holes and wrap around the cover with tension (still available) and it filled the inner part of the wheel. It was difficult and time-consuming, and, the vinyl strings eventually breaks. I recommend this 'new and improved' version. Rubber and vinyl degrades in heat and UV. Did you know that wonderful 'new car smell' is highly carcinogenic, expecially when hot, and all the glue they use on carpeting and interior fabric, also. This has been well known and accepted for over 50 years but it sells cars. FYI. 
Use with mitten and warm to hot water following a good high pressure hose down. Let it sit a minute on surface then wipe with soapy mitten. Hose off. I use very warm to hot water with very little of this concentrated soap. Always wash when your car surface is as cool as you can get it in the warm months. I have shade which works best but not essential. I use this grit guard to wax my car using 2 bucket method. The grit guard works very well. If your car is very dirty, using this guard would be a big plus Great way to protect your gauge - A MUST HAVE EXTRASome reviewers have commented on this being difficult to fit.The leaflet recommends use of silicon spray, however even easier with hot water.1- Bowl of HOT (not boiling but HOT), leave the cover sitting in the hot water for a good 5 minutes.2- Rub a few splashes of water around the gauge.3- Take the boot out of the water (keep it hot and wet).4- It will then slip straight on, just wipe off the water and then let it dry.JOB DONE !Just remember to use some thread tape or sealer when re-fitting the hose. 
This is a leather spray that does help keep the leather soft and looking nice. It is NOT a heavy duty cleaner thus if your leather is in really poor condition like one of my chair covers, this spray will not do the job. This works well on my auto seats and does give a good shine and soft feeling. I like the product. It is easily applied. Do not apply if the leather is really hot after sitting in the driveway as it gets sticky. I should have known better. I use Lexol leather conditioner on the leather seats in the car and leather furniture. Makes the leather very soft and pliable. Seems to work well on lighter colored leather. Note that this leather cleaner AND conditioner both discolor plastic slightly. With that in mind, as long as you're careful the conditioner makes a leather wrapped steering wheel feel great. Also tested it on a beige leather couch, the cleaner and conditioner worked nicely.For black leather (larger surfaces than a steering wheel) the conditioner proved to be a little harder to use- it left streaks unless the entire area the product is applied to is coated pretty well.Not bad, I'd probably use it again. 
This is designed to work with the Valterra bayonet fitting on your Gray or Black water dump valve and it does just that... Not to remove scratches, but to conceal and and make look presentable. It works well and does what it is supposed to do. Great for light scratches. Harder to use on black cars, but with a little patience it works well. The lock it self looks like a quality built.  Heavy and shiny.  But sadly, it does not fit my 2004 Honda VTX1300c on either rotors. 
This tool is perfect for solo bleeding brakes. All you do is attach it to a bottle/jar/container via some adapters and tubing and then bleed away without the fear of getting air back into the brake lines.The only tiny problem is that the tubing attached to the bleeder screw is a air tight one way check valve so when you take it off a large amount of brake fluid is trapped on the intake side of the tube and if your not careful may make quite a mess on the calipher. I wish they included some button on the tool to open the check valve fully to allow the excess fluid trapped in the tubing to flow downward into the container to minimize the chances to make a mess. Part Number:  FL820SManufacturer:  MOTORCRAFTDearborn, MIOE Number  F1AZ 6731 BDOEManufacturer  FordOE Number  XW4E 6714 DAOEManufacturer  FordEngineered specifically for Ford, Lincoln and Mercury vehicles, each Motorcraft oil filter, including the popular Motorcraft FL-1A, uses as many as 12 high-quality components. Construction features include:-  Steel Cases"Ironed" for a precise fit, fluted to ease removal and painted for rust-resistance.-  Pressure Relief ValveWhen it's cold outside or if the filter becomes clogged, oil flow through the filter can be reduced. If this happens, the relief valve opens to provide a continuous oil supply. Its design also minimizes the chance of contaminated oil recirculating back-  Anti-Drain Back ValveThis feature keeps oil in the filter to prevent "dry starts" after your engine has been turned off. It's made with specially formulated material that resists the aging effects that an engine's heat can cause.-  Efficient Filter MediaRe-engineered media increases Motorcraft filters' dirt-collecting capability, allowing them to capture more engine-harming particles than ever before. This little thing works perfectly!  I use to use a pressure bleeder, but was concerned about what some people say, that pressure bleeders push more air into the brake fluid, which causes both more air and moisture to absorb into the fluid.  Best way is to press the brake pedal, or put a vacuum on the bleeder screws.  A vacuum would be nice, but also a lot more work to setup initially.Instructions say this check valve does not work on air, only brake fluid, but on empty systems you can still pump the pedal until fluid comes out, and run your drain side pipe into a container that has brake fluid at the bottom.  That way you only suck back up fluid, not air.  Once you have fluid in the lines, this is completely unnecessary.  Did all 8 bleed screws on a Brembo-equipped car, was effortless.  I completely trust this little check valve, hope it lasts.  Rinsed it out with simple green and then a little PB Blaster to keep it from corroding or whatever.Remember to buy a couple more yards of cheap 3/16" clear hose from the hardware store, so you'll never run out, and can throw away what you've used after each brake job.The included hose clamp is worthless, but you don't need it anyways.Another great trick to compress pistons is to crack open the bleeder screw first, then push in each brake piston.  Fluid will go out through this check valve, instead of fighting every other brake piston.  Makes life a LOT easier, and does not push old fluid back up the brake lines or risk overflowing your reservoir. 
There is no swiveling between the cap, the tube and the bottle. In other words, when you screw/unscrew the cap onto the car's brake fluid container, there will be kinking on the tube itself. Untangling the kinks is a chore because the bottle is both quite big and heavy when it is filled with brake fluid. They should have designed with some quick-connect/disconnect like the compressor air hose. That would be an ideal solution, but I guess it will add to the cost for adding that feature. However, I doubt that it would cost much because I browsed through the air-hose connectors at Harbor Freight and they run typically a couple of bucks each. I might modify this bleeder with the air hose connector to address the problem. This tool is perfect for solo bleeding brakes. All you do is attach it to a bottle/jar/container via some adapters and tubing and then bleed away without the fear of getting air back into the brake lines.The only tiny problem is that the tubing attached to the bleeder screw is a air tight one way check valve so when you take it off a large amount of brake fluid is trapped on the intake side of the tube and if your not careful may make quite a mess on the calipher. I wish they included some button on the tool to open the check valve fully to allow the excess fluid trapped in the tubing to flow downward into the container to minimize the chances to make a mess. Did a great job putting the transmission fluid back into the Ford and Mercury sealed 5R55W trans. Just screw the pump into the qt. bottle trans. fluid and pump.. 
Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.  The pickle fork is the last resort for me, as it will damage the balljoint boot.I prefer to use the Snap On balljoint remover.  If that one cannot fit, then I will try this tool.  If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork. Your Hi Lift jack will not work well for you if you are off-road.  Sand = Nope. Mud = Nope.  Must have a wide base to make the jack work correctly. (I know from experience - ugh) This product does not fit your 2012 Toyota Tacoma! That's according to Amazon.YES, IT DOES FIT MY 2012 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab.I don't know what that white powder is on the rubber seal, but I cleaned it before installing the cap.  No error codes and no gas stolen so far. 
my old one broke and this one was a pefect fit replacement. Just unscrewed the old one and used the new screws supplied. It just works like the old one used to on my family car, I also bought a few for spares Used on all my cars, didn't work on my Porsche 944 because it's old and has a semi - mechanical air sensor.. 
The Amazon fitment guide said this would fit my 2004 Chevrolet Silverado LS, 5.8L V8.  It DID screw into the tank opening but after about five minutes of driving, I got a &#34;tighten fuel cap&#34; warning on my truck computer.  This cap can only be tightened so tight before it starts to &#34;click.&#34; It turns out that my truck has a cap that does not have threads on it like this model has.  Look closely at your factory gas cap.  If it doesn' have threads and has a geometrical triangle pattern on the side of it, skip this cap.  I ended up getting an ACDelco, GT264 cap from Amazon and it works just like the factory cap.  The Amazon picture for the GT264 does not show a side view of the cap, but all you have to do is Google the model number and there are hundreds of pictures on the internet.  I commend Amazon for their great shipping and return policy.  I will NEVER take them for granted.  I am a true LIFETIME Amazon customer. Toyota does not make a locking gas cap for the Tacoma and the gas hatch door is not a locking type.  If you want to lock the gas tank this is one of few options to do so.  As you can see by it's picture, the cap is threaded to the bottom which is NOT the same as Toyota's OEM cap, which is smooth for about a half inch to make replacing the cap after filling the tank easier.I had to call Stant to make sure this would fit on my 2012 as the Amazon guide indicated it would not. I does fit but is not as slick as the original. Some online reviews and the Toyota manual warn about a "check engine" light if the gas tank is not properly sealed by the cap. That was not an issue with mine.I'd spend more money and buy one that fit better if it was available but from my research I couldn't find one. I have used Stant locking caps for years on all my vehicles. This does fit a 2004 Ranger fine but the tether that keeps the gas cap attached to the truck will not work without modifications. There is no slot!........ I  removed the retaining ring on the bottom to see if I could modify it by trimming it down but if you trim it you will remove the ability to keep the ring attached.I ended up trimming the inside of my tether and slipping it over the top of the cap then super gluing a piece of electrical wire around the perimeter as a retainer. It's a lot of hassle to do but I didn't want to use it without the tether.One good thing, I was able to see just how they designed the locking mechanism in these. It is a engineering feat just short of genius, but it is not something that I really needed to know about.Anyways, it works as it should but only time will tell if it throws the check engine light due to a poor seal as some reviewers have stated on here. If it does then I will update my review.Some reviewers received 10510 caps with tether slots and some did not, which leads me to believe Stant must have made a new injection mold die but didn't provide any tether gap in it.Edit 11-12-2013: No problems with check engine light, it's a good seal. 
I read all the reviews how using this product... on the actual bottle you will find the instructions...I used 1 Oz per gallon of fresh gas. I didn't have any white smoke from my bike...I still need to run the motorcycle more often and see if clean property the dust of my carburetor. I don't have much to say about it. Its a filter. Don't notice any extra &#34;freshness&#34; to the air. I had an old filter and it didn't smell, so this one doesn't add any extra benefit to me. I'll probably just stick to the cheaper filter next time. Definitely change these yourself. DO NOT let your oil change guys do it for you. Look up your car on Youtube and type is cabin filter replacement. I'm sure you'll find a simple step by step video on how to do it yourself. I'm guessing you'll save $30+ It works well for a few days and after that I have to dump my tank and deposit more Bio-Paks. I just don't know, I may be doing something wrong. But, I don't think so because I am following the directions on the package. If any one has some tips please post them.................... 
This pump works as advertised.  I needed it to transfer fluid to the rear differential of my Honda Element.  Screwed it into the quart bottle of fluid and pumped differential full......no muss no fuss! Used to replace transmission fluid in 01 Acura Integra automatic transmission, perfect length funnel to preform this process.  Sits perfect above engine t pour fluid in.  Cap on hose is nice to prevent mess. I use only 100% synthetic fluids for my 1990 Toyota Camry which I keep in mint condition since the day I bought it new in 1990. Mobil 1 Extended Performance motor oil. Royal Purple Max ATF Synthetic automatic transmission fluid, Royal Purple fully synthetic Power Steering fluid and Toyota 50/50 Anti-Freeze coolant.I won't give a lesson on why synthetic fluids are far superior to conventional fluids. I've had that argument WAY before auto manufacturers started REQUIRING synthetic fluids right from the factory. They are far superior.In the case of this brake fluid. I've compared all the spec. sheets on all the major brake fluids, and this one meets the highest standards. I just keep is simple with fluids and follow two rules. Change EVERY fluid on your vehicle yearly (more often n the case of the motor oil depending how much you drive) and use the BEST fluids available. THIS is the best brake fluid available. 
Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. What can I say it's an air filter for a car, it fit and came in a box.  Nuff said This fit my 2007 Jeep Grand Cherokee V6. Price was great when I purchased. Can't beat having car parts shipped to your door for free. 
Goes with mower yearly tuneup.The only problem I had was the bottle had a small hole in it. The box and other items I had ordered were soaked in oil. The bottle had leaked 2 oz. I use this and change it often on a high hp application trans. The only gripe i have is the bottle wish it came in standard quart bottle to allow fit for fluid transfer pump but a cheap funnel from Walmart does the job. The Redline Water Wetter is also another good product There is an acceptable itsy bitsy leak left. You can watch &#34;Fixing Oil Seal Leaks Fast&#34; video on YouTube by scottykilmer. You need 8 ounces for car engine or transmission usage, and 3 ounces for power steering. I am going to order more for power steering and transmission usage. 
Easy to replace. It lacks Toyota instructions, but it is exactly like existing Toyota part with all wires colored the same way so it is very obvious how to connect those.The original part has a silicone rubber tube going all the way from top to bottom with wires running inside it. This part only provides a short length of tubing that, at best, would cover half of the length of wires on my car.I thing they should provide a &#34;telescoping&#34; tubing of two diameters with one going inside of the other while you are crimping wires and then extended to cover the full length of wires I use this on older Lycoming engines where they used clamps with a short rubber hose between the metal tubes for the intake. This is much easier to snake around exhaust etc to the clamp then regular pliers. RV orginal hose was leaking from metal to rubber hose area. I had to also buy an adaptor becasue the small end was not the same size. Found one at an RV parts store for .99 cents. 
The size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous. The funnel is 10" long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6" long. It states that the funnel is 4" x 4" but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2-1/4" in diameter at the widest point.It would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless.

So, I can't comment on how well it works.  The main reason for this review is to put it out there that it does not work with a 2000 Chevy Silverado.  The siphon tube does not fit thru the bottom of the dip stick tube.  It would be really nice if Mityvac had a published list of what vehicles it works with and what ones it does not.  I have my fingers crossed that it'll work with my jet ski, otherwise there will be a new/(un)used Mityvac on *****'slist.  Long story short, do your research to see if you can confirm or deny if it will work with your vehicle before you buy it. 
How can one really rate it, as it is used for protection and no idae how long it should last, yet is was as listed so I give it the benifit ogf the doubt... I was suprised how well and how easy they worked even on an extended van.  It saves wear and tear on the shoulders. Not only do they not fit, very thin and wonder how long they will last.  Also if you have batteries with the post and screw/nut the latter is not covered. 
Very simple to hook to drainage hose. Make sure the one end is secured to the sewer hose rinser and the other hooked into a sewer drain. Turn on the water and let the sewer hose get cleared out of any left over debris. This makes cleaning out the drainage hose easy and you stay dry while doing it. I live in an apartment with an attached indoor parking lot, so no water hose or anything.Every weekend (as best as I can), I head down there with a bag containing this No Rinse solution, a microfiber sponge, a couple of towels, a Windex spray, a gallon of water in a bottle, and a bucket. 2 caps of the No Rinse and 20 minutes later, my car is clean and shiny. No hassle, no water wasting, no hose needed. Does a great job cleaning grime that collects on KN filters for my truck and twin intakes on G37s. Less than 10 minutes of soaking and it removes the old oil and dirt. Rinse with water and blow dry with a hair dryer or even a leaf blower and your ready to reapply new oil that allows the flow through fabric to filter out fast flowing intake. 
While the springs on my Gen2 Sequoia were large in diameter and very stiff, these compressors did do the job. They were starting to bend while under compression, which isn't nice to see, but I was told this is normal. Just be careful, don't compress any fraction of an inch you don't need. I haven't put this cover through difficult duty, and probably won't...it will stay in the carport most of the time. However, construction is good, the small vents on either side are pretty nice.Regarding fitment, the XL fits a BMW F800ST (with stock rear luggage rack) perfectly. This bike is about 90&#34; long, maybe a few inches longer with the rack. Like others I have found the cover to fall short in the sizing department. I understand it's leather and unlike a comparable vinyl based product, sizing is critical because unlike vinyl, leather can't be stretched too much for a fit. This limits you to a steering wheel that is within 5mm of the product's diameter. I have tried fitting this on two steering wheels. First on my F250 and it was literally impossible. The diameter of the cover missed it by inches. Then I tried fitting this on my Saturn Vue. Now this is important, because the Vue is geared towards women whom have small hands, ergo the steering wheel is smaller and skinnier. So you would think the Vue is a perfect candidate...NOPE. I wrestled with the installation and would described it like sparring with a bear. After 10mins (not including breaks) I finally got the thing on the Vue. The result was the leather had stretched so much, it literally developed permanent stretch marks. Also, like other's who have commented in their Feedback, the wrap only made it barely halfway around the grip of the wheel. So there are now two pressure points on my hands from the front and back seams of the wrap when gripping the wheel.I gave it a rating of three due to it's exceptional quality. It is well made in the sense that its leather is very thick and the seams are well stitched. If this was right-size for my application it would have rated it Five.Part of the poor fit was my fault since I didn't pay close enough attention to the specs and prior to ordering I should have measured my steering wheels for proper fit. I mistakenly assumed since I had two steering wheels and one that is especially skinny, that It wouldn't have been a problem fitting.Take proper care with the dimensions of 15 x 1.5  Measure the girth of your steering wheel with a seamstress measuring tape. If 1.5" does not cover at least 70% of you steering wheel circumference and the wheel's diameter is great than 15 inches, you will be immensely disappointed or at the very least frustrated with the install. 
Very cheaply made product. It works but could be made with better quality product. Probably wouldn't buy this product again I used this for my german made car, works good and cheaper than the oem stuff.  an excellent product will definately buy again. Doesn't work worth a darn.  Regular wax works better than this product.  Very disappointed with Mequiar which I thought was a good brand.  I will go back to Turtle products from now on. 
It does what it is supposed to do, that is to increase placement distance from the car to the electrical outlet It does what it is supposed to and suds up. Does what it says it does......looks great ! 
IT WORKS Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.  The pickle fork is the last resort for me, as it will damage the balljoint boot.I prefer to use the Snap On balljoint remover.  If that one cannot fit, then I will try this tool.  If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork. I haven't really used it yet for the reason intended, changing the oil in my jet ski.  So, I can't comment on how well it works.  The main reason for this review is to put it out there that it does not work with a 2000 Chevy Silverado.  The siphon tube does not fit thru the bottom of the dip stick tube.  It would be really nice if Mityvac had a published list of what vehicles it works with and what ones it does not.  I have my fingers crossed that it'll work with my jet ski, otherwise there will be a new/(un)used Mityvac on *****'slist.  Long story short, do your research to see if you can confirm or deny if it will work with your vehicle before you buy it. 
Must have if you own one a Toyota that uses 64mm oil filters.This is the tool that will fit, many other socket wrenches on the market is either 64.5mm or 65mm, some may workBut more often then not, they slips and cant loosen nor tighten the filters enough.Cat in one piece aluminum, not assembled by spot welding pressed sheet metal. So it will do the job and wont break apart.Definite professional grade. ...fits my 1973 Chevy/GMC 4x4 steering wheel perfect. Stretch it over the wheel and wrap the vinyl string around it nice and tight. The vinyl will break so just stretch it a little. a regular 32mm socket will not fit in the space of my equinox. this is a kind of shorter 32mm socket designed only for oil filter cap job. it works fine. 
My unit did not come with any instructions.  The tool seems too complicated to be very useful, but does work. does the job. does job. 
Works as needed, only problem is it will only fit a standard oil jug not the gallon. a regular 32mm socket will not fit in the space of my equinox. this is a kind of shorter 32mm socket designed only for oil filter cap job. it works fine. The gas cap on my Corvette just would not lock anyone and gas mileage was suffering. It was very easy to replace and fits great. 
Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. 
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. I would install this on your Jeep as soon as you purchase the vehicle.  They're very easy to install and protect you from scratches that could lead to rust.  The guards fit perfectly on my 2011 Jeep Rubicon 2 door. Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. 
Fits perfectly on a 1992 2.2 Camry. The plastic washer that came with it was tossed in the trashed and used OEM gasket instead. It filters oil and comes with the gasket and crush washer you need to change the oil Included instructions make changing the cabin filter a breeze. It literally takes 2 minutes if you have a philips screwdriver in hand. Quality of the filter seems good. 
This is well made with great capacity.  Far better than the units you will find at walmart or your  local autozone. This is the heavy duty version of the less expensive version that Amazon also sells.  Don't be mistaken and order the other smaller, less aggressive wheel chocks.  Order these, hefty and well made.  After all, your goal is to stop a potential rolling of your RV, isn't it? The standard which all else are judged. Not as good as mean green but alot cheaper and readily available. 
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. Inexpensive, yet works as good as the ones sold by Honda dealerships. Made true to specs and fits right into the slot on my Accord 2006.Will buy again. 
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. Great Fit These item does fit perfect on my 2004 BMW x3. does what its suppose to do. so far so good thanks 
Easy to install. Screw out each tube to the necessary length, and the rubber ends hold the bar in place. Just got back from a trip. My refrigerator door somehow came open. Thank goodness I had these in place or I would have had a major clean-up. I bought this as a spare. I had to remove the factory original bezel when one of the lock release rod clips broke & I couldn't open the tail gate. You must take this off in order to reach the rod to open the gate. As I removed the original bezel, one of its  tabs broke. So fare the old one is still in place but,  I now have a spare one when it eventually falls off. Not much to say, other than to let people know these work on Ford vehicles.I installed them on my Truck and my wife's Escape.  Both vehicles only use 2 screws so I was able to use one package for the 2 vehicles.On my truck I took the extra time to reach behind and put the white plastic "nut" on the end of the screw (on the tip of the screw that stuck through the bumper).  This will make it pretty much impossible to remove the screws without holding onto the nut.(I think the white plastic thing is actually meant as a bushing for larger holes???)For my wife's escape I couldn't reach the back side of the screw without take apart the hatch so I just put the screws in.Like others have said, this isn't "bulletproof" - but it will deter theft.  I could take out the old screws with my pocketknife so anyone walking by could steal the license plate in about 10 seconds time.  This will prevent that type of theft... 
I got a power plug to power plug style &#34;jumper&#34; device for my daughter, in case the 12V battery on her Prius dies.  Since the Prius doesn't use the 12V battery to start the motor, she doesn't need real jumper cables.  However, it's a keyless ignition, so she will not be able to jump power plug to power plug.  The battery on the Prius is has small terminals, so these are a nice size and should do the job of getting power from someone else's light to her battery. This thing is Awsome.  It has all a camper or over the road traveler needs for emergency power and presurized air.  Comes with Battery Cables, Air Pressure Hose and Coinnections, Instruction Booklet (a must read), and several types of power outlets.  You will need an electrical extension cord, which is not included, to charge it up via AC Outlet, or you can charge it up via the 12Volt Auto Lighter Adapter Cord, which is included, but which I would not recomend unless you have no other source of power, because this thing looks like it packs a punch.  I like it and think it's worth the money.  I just started using it so Icannot speak to its durability, bt otherwise it is Awsome.  Recomend. The Battery Tender Junior 12V Charger comes complete with everything needed to charge your 12V battery.  I purchased this model to specifically charge my motorcycle battery and I am pleased to say that the unit works great.  It is a very compact charger and is supplied with several attachments to ensure that your battery is kept in an optimum condition.I made the permanent hard wire attachment to my battery using the color coded leads connected directly to the appropriate positive & negative terminals on the battery. The opposite female end has an end cap which can cover the inlet when not in use. When I know that I will not be hitting the road for an extended period of time, I simply plug the unit in to maintain my existing battery's power supply.Battery Tender makes larger charging units, but this battery charger is great for charging everything from batteries for ATV's and motorcycles to scooters and lawn mowers. Because of it's very discreet size it does not take up any needed space. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to protect their battery investment and do not want to compromise space and versatility. 
The GM bumper connector has its own cap to keep the weather out, and so does this Adapter. But I really wouldn't leave this adapter plugged in all the time because the GM connector then is not sealed.This adapter fits well, with a locating keyway that fits the groove of the GM connector, aligning all the pins correctly. It's a tight fit so that it won't fall out in case the cable to your trailer has enough weight to tug on this adapter to any significant degree.I don't have any illumination problems so the LED functions are not fully tested.  Frankly, I do a walk-around after hooking up anyway, with marker lights and flashers on to check that everything works.  I presume the LEDs will tell me if there's an issue some day. The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around! This stuff is great for keeping threads lubed up so they are easy to install/remove.  I used some on my new spark plugs and on my battery clamp.  My old plugs were very hard to get out because they didn't have any of this stuff.  Now the battery clamp and plugs will come out very easily.  It does have a strong smell to it. 
The wire used to make these test leads was not test lead wire; It is much stiffer. When attaching the leads to small circuit boards, you may need to support the leads so they do not tip the board on an angle. The gauge on this wire is only 16gauge and it will not safely power all the items that you may wish to run off your battery. There are two horns, not one. One is 400Hz and the other one is 500Hz.PIAA | Automotive Sports Horn (400/500Hz) #85110The are exact fits on the mounts as the OEM horns and use the same bolts. A 1/4 inch drive ratchet and a 12mm socket is needed to remove and install the bolt. They came with grounding leads with ring spade lugs that mounted readily under the existing M6 bolts on the radiator supports. All you need is a 10mm socket.The two wiring harness leads are too short to connect the horns. Two wire tie mounts hold the harness to the aluminum bumper reinforcement. You can cut off the ties and use the OEM harness to connect the horns, but I chose not to.  I prefer NOT to cut off the OEM connector blocks.I made two pigtail extensions out of 18 gauge black primary wire, 5 inches long. One end needs a 1/4 inch wide exposed male quick disconnect. The other end needs an insulated female 1/4 inch quick disconnect terminal. Since I used 18 gauge wire, I used the red coded ones.The exposed male connector slides into the OEM horn connector perfectly. The female one clips easily onto the positive terminal of each horn.The horns how have a weather shield on the apertures.Best thing to my surprise is that they appear to be very high quality and Made in Japan.Also nice is that they need no modification to the horn relay or circuit. 
I needed this item for an air compressor that draws 15A, and my 12V socket can only handle 10A.  This item is perfect, and small enough to fit in my air compressor's case.  It would be nice if we know how many amps it could handle, but the wire gauge provided is more than enough for my 15A need. At less then $10 this is a steal!  The unit is well made and really does a nice job.  It's far bettter then the round adapter that plugs straight in and that on the back side you plug in the 30 amp cord.  The 90 degree 15 amp plug emliminates the problem of the cord pulling out or partially disconnecting from the outlet. I required an ammonia-free window cleaner for my tinted windows. This does the job quite nicely. It isn't how well it does, rather how safely it does it.

It fit perfectly and teamed with the Bolt Lock BLT7018448 5/8'' Receiver Lock (Keyed specifically for your line of vehicle) it can be kept in the Jeep and my daughter doesn't need anything but her car key.The extender is exactly as advertised, well made, fit perfectly and does eactly what it is inteded for. 
These item does fit perfect on my 2004 BMW x3. does what its suppose to do. so far so good thanks Sizes listed in reviews and the two in the description (15.8 x 10.5 x 5, and 12.5 x 9.5 x 7) don't match to what I received...The bag I received is in between what has been listed in the descriptions:  13.5" x 9" x 6" (empty).While seemingly a good quality bag, with a fair amount of straps and attached rain-cover (hidden in the heel of the bag), it seems the manufacturer (or seller) has no idea how to use a measuring tape!The bag itself is quite nice... good padding, rubberized bottom to prevent sliding, small pockets on either side, and zippers seem of reasonable quality.For the price and bag quality, I'm not complaining.  It works great on my CB750, and it does fit on the pillion of my VT1100c2 (without having to remove my rider backrest)  So if you have standard seating (or a touring/adventure style), this bag will do well for you as a pillion bag, and with a little strap adjustments, it also fits vertical on the front or back of a sissy-bar, or horizontal on a larger luggage rack... the bag it came with dosent fit it, if youve got it adjusted to the middle or top setting, this does exactley what they say, seems pretty rugged, it fits my duratrac 245/75/16s perfect and holds my 225lb self no prob. 
I tried to be careful, so I enter my car information. Amazon fit checks show that it would fit 1996 Lexus LS400. I ordered and found out it didn't fit. My car has an arm that requires the thin side but this wiper blade is too big to fit. Ordered this to put on my travel trailer so I could tow my little 2 man boat. Very high quality and fit perfectly with one minor alteration. The bolts were too long so I had to cut off about an inch for it to fit properly. Worked perfectly. Highly recommend This sunshade is easy to use and folds up to a nice compact size that fits under my seat well. It's a quite large size so is made for an SUV or car that has a large windshield like my Toyota Prius. While it doesn't fit the Prius perfectly, it's the closest size to being perfect.At this price, I have no complaints with this and can recommend it. 
Exact replacement from OEM. Exact fit worked perfect . Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs. Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. Great Fit 
This is the only glass cleaner I use in my vehicles.  It is TINT SAFE and is the best at cleaning glass, inside and out.  Sprays on as a light foam, so it sticks to the glass without running. I use a lot of Mothers products but this glass cleaners is the worse. It leave streaks all over the glass. Also, when used on the inside of the glass it fogs up the glass. At night the glass fogs up so bad it becomes dangerous. I've tried using a Microfiber and Terry cloth towel. I've switched back to straight water to clean the glass. Does a super job on brass, copper, silver, aluminum, bronze and stainless steel. Polishes most metals to a mirror-like finish. Very similar to Flitz polishing cream. 
Lately, there seems no difference between polishing compound/rubbing compound. The latter used to refer to very coarse material but this no longer seems true.I use this compound mostly on plastics and it can remove residual adhesive, scratches, etc... It can also be used to polish clear coat layer on metallic paint. Paint whatever with metallic paint first, then spray a few layers of clear paint (gloss). Wait a day or two to completely dry and lightly polish with this compound & soft cloth. You'd be happy with the result. This paste wax is a great wax when added with a long lasting cleaning wax to have the perfect shine and protection of your cars paint. I use these pads for final polishing and sealant application.  Yes, I flat out love these pads.  Oh yeah.After washing and cleaning the paint surface with the proper compound, I follow up with Ultra Cut and sealant, both of which I apply using this pad.  Surface prep listed below:1. Wash with Meguiar's Gold Class Car Wash.2. Clean surface with Ryobi, 6&#34; orbital sander and 6&#34; terry cloth pad combined with Meguiar's &#34;Ultra Cut Compound&#34; or &#34;Medium Cut Cleaner.&#34;3, Polish surface with Ryobi, 6&#34; orbital sander, with Hook-Loop Velcro strips attached to pad and polish with &#34;Ultra Finishing Polish&#34; applied using a 6.5&#34; soft foam polishing pad; the yellow 6.5&#34; foam pad.4. Finish using the yellow, 6.5&#34; soft foam polishing pad.  The Synthetic Sealant goes on very easy and with a micro cloth, comes off equally easy and leaves a very satisfying shine.Warning: due to splatter factor, make sure to smear Ultra Finishing Polish and Synthetic Sealant onto the surface before turning the dual action (DA) buffer on.After taking the time to wash and clean the surface of the paint with Ultra and/or Medium Cut Compound, applying Ultra Finishing Polish and Synthetic Sealant to the paint is pleasure as with this pad, it goes on very nicely.(all compounds, polishes and sealants are removed with clean micro fiber cloths.)In my opinion, for final polish or sealant application, these pads are the bomb. 
I highly reccomend this with the Meguiar's DA polisher,  perfect to use with Meguiars Ultimate Polish! But make sure you remove any contaminants from your paint beforehand! have been using this continuously for past 2 yrs on my mustang gt deep metallic blue paint.. result are awesome, this shampoo provide enough lather to avoid any scratches. The Zymol Leather Cleaner does an EXCELLENT job of:-CLEANING: The cleaning action is clearly visible: the more vigor you put into working the leather, the more the application of the Zymol Leather Cleaner turns white and sudsy. Follow through the cleaning by wiping off with a clean dry rag and any dirt and grime picked up by the Zymol Leather Cleaner will transfer onto the rag.RESTORING: The end result: the Zymol Leather Cleaner leaves the leather with a polished look as pristine as when the leather was brand new. Mind you, it doesn't accomplish this not by leaving a greasy residue behind like some "cleaners" do. The Zymol Leather Cleaner not only leaves leather feeling clean with NO greasy residue, it restores the softness and suppleness of leather.The cleaning does clearly strip some of the natural oils from the leather. I would strongly advise you to follow through the cleaning with the Zymol Z-509 Leather Conditioner. Both the Z-509 Leather Conditioner and the Zymol Leather Cleaner are available here at Amazon as a package at a very reasonable price.I'm giving the Zymol Leather Cleaner my highest recommendation. Go on, give the Zymol Leather Cleaner a whirl and see for yourself what a FANTASTIC job it does of cleaning your leather! 
I had already used the clay bars on my Corvette to clean the painted surface then I had applied a liquid polish my Mothers and the car looked very decent. I then applied the Meguiars Gold Class wax and the results were excellent. There is a pad in the container when made application easy and I just let it dry and then took a soft cloth and removed the wax coating. The result if a very nice looking surface. I will be putting a couple of more coats on the car before I take it to the next show. I ddi this by hand and perhaps all of this would have been easier if I had an electric polisher. I am now looking for that machine. this is an excellent final coat wax for your car.  In my case I use the Meguiar's NXT polish,  wait several hours to let it cure, then apply this wax.  I use it on my car that has color (my other car is white).  Be aware, it is harder to buff this.  I maintain my cars by hand and became tired thei first time I used it.  (I washed, clayed, hand compounded, then did 2 coats of wax).  The next car I did I paced myself and washed/ compounded one day.  Then the next day I polished and waxed the car. I just finished my first spring washing when a fellow walked by my car and asked if this was 2011 CRV that I waswashing. I told him it was almost 4 years old and he could not believe it. I have to admit that the car does look like due to wonderful Mothers products and some elbow grease.Mothers Carnauba Wax is one of the weapons in keeping my car looking good.I start by washing my car. I don't dry it as this time as water drops will be removed by other steps. Then I clay the car to remove embedded specs, stuck on dirt, and this year I had rubber marks from clearing the snowMothers 07240 California Gold Clay Bar Paint Saving System. I don't clay every inch of the entire car. I just examine the car by sight for any imperfections and by my running my hand over the paint to feel any tiny bumps. When I feel some grittiness or see some dirt on the paint, I generously spray that section with Mothers Showtime Instant Detailer, then knead the piece of clay in my hand and rub it against the spot I identified. Normally, you see the dirt disappear in a few swipes. Sometimes you need to reapply the Detailer and repeat. Kneading is important as you want to work the little pieces of dirt into the clay, and not leave it on the surface of the clay ball where it can scratch the car. I also use the clay on non-painted areas such as glass and chrome if they have stains.After the claying step I wax the car is small sections using Carnauba Wax. It easy to work with.  I put it on a small section (each side of the car is done in 4 sections, for example), by the time I am done spreading it, it is ready to be wiped off, you don't have to wait.  I use micro fiber towels to wipe the wax, using a fresh piece of the fiber on each section.As my final step I apply Back-to-blackMothers 06108 Back-To-Black - 8 ozto non-painted surfaces. This turns the dull plastic into shiny new looking surface. Back-to-black is also effective in removing any wax that might have accidently got on the plastic, that's why I do back-to-black as the last step.Carnauba Wax gives a superior shine.  It is easy and pleasant to work with.  I highly recommend it. 
Liquid Glass is a terrific polish that goes on easily, protects for months and actually creates a deeper shine with additional coats.  I don't know if I believe the hype that many coats of Liquid Glass create a scratch resistant shell on your paint, but as a meticulous car nut, I can say that Liquid Glass is the best polish I have ever come across.  This polish goes on easily with a microfiber cloth and comes off very easily with another microfiber cloth.  It is not a wax but rather a clear acrylic coating.  I highly recommend it.PROS: Long lastingDeep, superior shineEasy to apply / buff offCan be used in sunCONS: Cannot be used over existing coats of wax/polish (unless you use LG pre-cleaner)Fairly expensiveTough to remove cured polish once appliedI posted a picture of my Liquid Glassed blue Shelby above.  Good luck. I followed the directions for cleaning the top but it did not do much as far as cleaning off the grease from the top mechanism on the lower sides of my tan fabric top. It did however provide a nice protective water resistant coating when applied as others have done here instead of using the sprayer. I used a brush and coated the top as if painting it. This way it goes on heavier and does not cause over-spray on painted or glass surfaces.While I only gave it a 3 star I am sure it is as good as the Rag Top brand and a lot less expensive. It should also be noted that our top is very old and was not properly cared for before we bought the car so it very well may work a lot better on a newer top. OK, must say, love my cars and want them to look great. In the last decades, I've used a huge array of the waxes out there, in the never ending quest for the perfect shine: Meguire's, (many versions) Turtle Wax, Zymol, Liquid Glass, Future 2000, Black Magic, Rain Dance, 3M, Turtle Wax Ice (paste and liquid), Turtle Wax Black Box, Mother's, Color Magic, etc. Liquid, paste, carnauba, synthetic, carnauba/sytntetic, cleaner wax, cleaner polish wax, polish wax, clay bar system, liquid clay bar. And those are just the ones off the top of my head!With that said, here are the conclusions:- I've never noticed a real difference between most any of them with respect to how the car looks after I've applied them. Put them on and the car looks great. This applies to the true waxes - the quickie things like Turtle Wax Liquid Ice, which isn't a wax at all IMHO, being the exceptions.- For most all of them, if you look at on line reviews, one will say it's the best and greatest, the next will hate it. So, VERY subjective.- Seems the more it costs and/or the more aplication effort involved, the higher it rates and the more staunch the opinions. Think there is a HUGE self fulfilling prophecy going on here;) Liquid Glass was expensive and a huge pain to apply (it looked just like any other I've used), yet it is rated 5 stars by most.- Carnauba provides the strongest protection against physical damage by stones and road debris. BUT is harder to apply and least durable over time.- Synthetic provides the most durable protection against the elements. AND is easy to apply.- God help me for saying this, but I can't tell a huge difference between a carnauba and synthetic wax job - both shine beautifully.That said, the goals of waxes/waxing is: Great shine, durable protection, less work, less needed yearly applications and reasonable pricing.So, here is the secret formula for those goals:1) Wax twice a year.2) Apply a carnauba/cleaner wax coat3) Apply Turtle Wax Ice PASTE coat - this is a good synthetic, but it's real advantage is that it is CLEAR. Not only does it not leave ANY white residue, but it can and should be used on all surfaces of the exterior - paint and PLASTICS. So, it is fast to apply/remove and it makes plastics look brand new.To the review of Nu Finish, it is a fine synthetic with the advantages of being highly rated for durability by "a leading consumer magazine" (as was Turtle Wax Ice Paste)and being easy to apply and remove - can do a whole car in like 45 minutes. BUT, it leaves the hated white residue, especially on plastics.  We're it not for that, I would have given it 5 stars - like I would most any reputable wax product out there..... 
Durable quality and fair price. These filters are made by a well-known manufacturer and have great quality, but the price is lower than buying the manufacturers equivalent name brand. Excellent quality. Ease of application and removal leaving a beautiful, durable shine. I have detailed high end cars for years and this is a great product for the price. Mother's is a name to trust when you want excellent product quality. They over achieve. 
Does a fine job. Only had to do it once last season.  We'll see how it works on a full season This is a great wax. I live in Chicago so weather can be kind of crazy. This wax lasts about 3 washes for me until I need to reapply more. Great price and is what I was expecting it to be and do. Not sure how long it will last, time will tell. 
Bottle came as described, have not had to use it, but it comes with the TPMS safe sealant in most flat kits. I was hoping to use the clay bar to remove water spots on a new truck but the one provided with this Mequiar's kit was worthless for this purpose. The kit does include everything you need to apply the products in the kit which is a plus and probably the reason the kit is so popular. Product is easy on/off. Provides a decent length of protection and a great shine. I use this product as my base coat of wax and layer finer waxes on top. Also, the included foam applicator is great. I actually use that applicator with more expensive waxes and use foam applicators from other sites with the NXT gen 2.0. 
this is an excellent final coat wax for your car.  In my case I use the Meguiar's NXT polish,  wait several hours to let it cure, then apply this wax.  I use it on my car that has color (my other car is white).  Be aware, it is harder to buff this.  I maintain my cars by hand and became tired thei first time I used it.  (I washed, clayed, hand compounded, then did 2 coats of wax).  The next car I did I paced myself and washed/ compounded one day.  Then the next day I polished and waxed the car. I'm not a professional car detailer but I have been waxing my own car for a good 10 years and understand the steps. I hand waxed this product onto my car and it was difficult to polish out with my soft terry cloth. For some odd reason the wax was leaving residue even though I was trying to buff it out with fresh cloth. After buffing the car, it did not come out as expected and the surface did not feel like there was wax, in fact it felt like I just washed my car only. I'm thinking this product needs to be applied using an orbital buffer as it requires more even pressure throughout. I will follow up on this review after trying out using a buffer. I am very surprised how well this works and how easy it is to use. When I read all the reviews, I thought everyone was just exaggerating. At first I was skeptical that it was possible to wash my car with this and a bucket of water. I have a 2011 green camaro and I would never take her to a car wash place. I have many detailing product and this is my favorite. I used to use other car soap to wash my car and I always had to wax it after to get it to shine. No I simply wash the car and it gives my car a very deep shine with so little effort. I bought a bucket that collects dirt at the bottom from chemical guys. I mix two capful of this and half bucket of water. Make sure to buy good and absorbant micro fiber cloth. If you do it right it shouldn't take more than 20 minutes to wash your car and it will shine as if you waxed it. If the car is very dirty, i usually rince it off with a hose first then apply this stuff with a micro fiber cloth. Then use two more cloth to dry the car. Its best to do the car one section at a time, sides, front and back of car. 
Easy to apply, gives a beautiful mirror finish- and I really appreciate how this polish leaves my black SUV looking almost new.  It makes removing those dang dried up bugs so much easier. In the Arizona sun any vehicle's paint needs ALL the protection it can get- and Liquid Glass does the job.  I will repurchase this item. Item arrived when promised, and was well packaged. I like the way this wax goes on, and it does leave a beautiful brilliant shine on my car.  It does require a little extra effort to get that sweet look. Car need a good cleanup to shine?  Use this.  I have a black Lexus and when used, its amazing how much of the hairline scratches go away and how deep and glossy the black ends up.  Use their Ultimate Compound first and follow with this.  It will make the shine and depth come out even more.  Looks like it just came out of a paint shop, has that &#34;wet&#34; look.  Impressed. 
CAVEAT: I have a front-wheel drive car, and I *back* into my garage.  The parking mat goes under my rear (un-driven) wheels.  Perhaps that makes my experience different from some of the others.I found about this product from a show on Speed Channel that was talking about garage products.  The host said the big benefit of this mat was that your tire rolled onto the front part of the mat first, holding it down, before it rolled it over the hump.  Thus, this mat didn't need to be fixed to your garage floor.  That's what I wanted: something that didn't need to be permanently attached to the floor.  The guy on TV didn't even mention that it came with tape.I did put a little masking tape on the garage floor to mark where I typically position the mat, so I can remove it (to sweep or whatever) and replace it right back where it goes as needed.  I don't use the adhesive tape it comes with to adhere it to the floor.  In my case, it works perfectly, just like the guys on Speed Channel described.  I've used it for a little over a month now, and my mat simply doesn't move.  (Ok, maybe it moves some ridiculously trivial amount, but for all intents and purposes, it has stayed put for a month.)  If the mat is going under your driven wheels or steering wheels, I can understand how it might move around.Others have complained that the mat is too narrow.  I wouldn't complain if they made it a little wider, but I don't have much trouble hitting it as it is. I use them for many different tasks around the house, shop, car. I even stuck them pointy end first into my large outdoor flowerpots thinking i could use them to slowly water my plants but alas, the water just stayed there as the bottom part was immediately filled with dirt once I jabbed it into the soil. so this sat around for awhile before i used it and sure enough i go to use it and the top of the UNOPEN tube is hardened and unuse able this is BS and i cant even retuen it 
I haven't even installed these yet, but they're windshield wipers.  How complicated can they be?  I'm assuming that when I turn them on, they will clear the windshield.  Mainly, I want to clear them from the list of items I have to review. I tried to sum it up in the title, this paint is tough, applies easily and covered more calipers than I needed it to. I painted 2 front and 3 rear calipers to a 1981 Trans Am. These are reasonable large calipers, fronts have large pistons and the rear pistons are smaller 2 1/2" to give you an idea of the size. I originally painted all 4 calipers at once, and still had a little bit of paint left in the can that I thought i'd save for touch up. StoneAuto company sent me two drivers side calipers, and I didn't figure it out till I installed them. So I had to use the remainder of the can to paint a 5th caliper, and it did it! Unlike other brands where there's nothing but air when the can gets close to empty,  VHT / Dupli-color impress me every time with their never ending paint cans. And there's still a little more left in the can!I also used the recommendedVHT SP118 Primerfirst, I dusted my calipers with 2 coats of primer then followed it with 2 dusting of the black and one last heavy coat, each coat spaced 10-12 minutes apart. I've maybe used 1/2 the can of primer. I use JB Weld for everything and it rarely if ever disappoints.I had a problem with people stealing the mirrors off one of my motorcycles, so I JB Welded them to the bars.  Fixed!I had a lamp harp with a broken threaded fitting, so I JB Welded it back on and it works perfectly!I had door stoppers that kept falling off, so I JB Welded them and they're solid now!I've used JB Weld for at least 100 other fixes and I love the stuff. 
Nice anti-seize, brush on bottom of lid, reasonably sized tub, will last years and years for casual home use. I've so far used it for my vise recondition and some bicycle stem bolt threads. It was too big to fit within any of our cabinet doors and wife wouldn't let me mount it where it could be seen !Anyone for fish cleaning knives in the storage area ? This product is a MUST have for anyone who does any type of electrical work (automotive, motorcycle, marine, etc) as it stops any corrosion from starting up or protecting a cleaned up connector... 
good adapter, no problem with it yet, does the job when i need it. I do recommend. Doesnt worth it to pay more.tks They say if you buy the best you won't be sorry.  But just because it costs more doesn't mean it's the best, does it?  Well I think in this particular case it is the best.  And you will pay for it.The Chevron Techron product gets high scores from everyone & everything I have read in many automotive mags, but the equipment they make it with must be made from gold boullion.  Suffice it to say if you want to clean your engine parts that gas touches, this stuff is the best.  I just gave it 4 stars because of price not quality.  I own several cars, motorcycle, boat, waverunners, so I'd buy it by the case if the price would come down enough to make it worth while.  On the other hand if you have one or two cars, I guess you don't need to put it in the tank all that frequently to obtain the results you want.  A bottle of piece of mind?  Yes, it works. This item does what it's supposed to do, protect the tow ball.  I'm very satisfied with my purchase.  The price was reasonable and it works.  What more can you ask for? 
First, as with all of the Dupli-Color Metalcast paints, if you want the metalcast effect, you'll have to use the Dupli-Color Metalcast Ground Coat (MC100) on the surface before you apply the color or it will not come out right. The can says that it also comes out the same if you're painting directly onto chrome like surface but I have not tried this so I don't know. Now for this green. I'm more of a blue and purple guy for dark colors so only by my personal preference do I say that this green comes out just a tad light in color for me. Overall though, if you use the ground coat this comes out great with a nice metal sheen. I recommend this product. These bulbs are fantastic! They aren't "blue" at all. Instead they are pure white. If you look at the bulbs when they're turned on, they give a tiny hint of blue, but the light they emit is completely pure white. They light up the road VERY well and reflect much better off objects than my previous stock halogens. A VERY good buy!! Hella Replacement.  Kinda.  Mine came with BLUE wire.. they should always be white. Its also not covered in fabric and the white ones are. 
This is the best wax for those who care about their car's paint. Although Collinite is more about protection than shine, it contains no cleaners so it can be layered with your favorite carnauba wax for maximum protection and shine. I ordered another container for 845 and 885, both used together throughout the year for optimum protection! Other products are great as well, but their synthetic waxes (sealants) don't even compare to Collinite, which contains carnauba.P.S. Amazon should really consider being a distributor of Collinite and provide AmazonPrime for their products. I love taking care of my vehicles.  I have used many expensive, imported products over the years.  However, Meguiar's keeps winning me back with their incredible offerings.  They are of high quality, effective, easy to find, and affordable.  However, take the affordable off.  I'd use their products, if they were 3x the price because I've used products that cost that much and are less effective.Meguiar's NXT Generation Tech Wax 2.0 highlights that experience.  I didn't want to like this wax/sealant as much as ones I paid thirty, forty, or fifty dollars to buy.  However, the results were obvious. On my vehicles, this is the best wax/sealant I have ever used.For optimum results I strongly encourage you before apply NXT 2.0, clay your car, clean with a paint cleaner (i.e. Scratch X or Deep Crystal Step 1), polish with a pure polish (Deep Crystal Step 2 or #7 Show Car Polish), and then apply this wax.  The results are truly remarkable.To maintain your shine, remove loose dirt and contaminants with Quick Exterior Detailer, or Ultimate Exterior Detailer.Meguiar's keeps delivering the good stuff, and I'm a fan. I have been using this for years, and it is hands down the best quick detailer on the market. Products like Meguiars Ultimate Detailer are more of a spray wax type product rather than a detailer, as they withstand car washes. However, those products cannot be used on fresh paint, and they are a bit harder to apply/remove than the Mothers Showtime (which is safe for fresh paint - confirmed with Mothers). Not to mention it has a great smell, provides a deep shine, and fills in light swirl marks. The 24oz version from Amazon is a great deal, and if you try it, you won't be disappointed. The same goes for any Mothers product, actually. 
I probably should compare it to another to see how accurate it is, but I really like how easy it is to use and turns off and on by itself. I was getting the dreaded CEL- check engine light on my 2004 car (9 years; 66,000 miles).  Oh no!  What do I do?  What do I do?  I went to a forum, posted the code and was directed to clean the MAF sensor.  Well, lordy, lordy&#8230; guess what?  My CEL was reset and it has not come back on.  This inexpensive can saved me at least a $200 'stealership' repair bill.  Some people use other products that can actually damage the MAF sensor- don't do that. How do you rate these?  They do exactly what they are supposed to do.  What more can I say.  It don't stink no more?!  LOL 
I've an Optima in my old Corvette that has now failed.  I've have read thru their warranty information.  It states that the battery must be returned to the selling dealer for warranty service.  It cannot be returned to Amazon for any reason.  Therefore my question is this:If the battery purchased thru amazon should require warranty service, how is this done and by whom? I preferr this over the other brands due to warranty. Battery Tender warranty a joke, They charge shipping and repair cost under their warranty. I replaced my Battery Tender w/ these. I have used this brand on my tractor and 4 wheelers. I am getting over 5 years of battery life on both w/ this. Any tech should have one of this when recommending replacement of a customers tire. Some states require you have this for state inspection. 
This meter should be used as a general indication of voltage only. I checked it against a calibrated professional meter and found it to be reading 4 volts high. This put the reading in the read area when in fact the voltage was acceptable. I will still use it on my generator and simply subtract 4 volts from the reading. Used this way it is marginally effective. I bought this to power cordless battery chargers and small bathroom appliances for camping.  One problem.  The manual clearly states it should not be used for any of those purposes.  Testing it with a DeWalt battery and charger confirmed this.  The DeWalt charger indicated a power failure and would not charge.From the manual."Certain chargers for small nickel-cadmium or nickel-metal-hydride batteries can be damaged if powered by this inverter. Two types of appliances are susceptible to damage: Small, battery-operated appliances such as flashlights, cordless razors and toothbrushes that plug directly into an AC receptacle.* DO NOT use this inverter with the above two types of equipment.""Some inexpensive audio systems may produce a slight "buzzing" sound when operated with the inverter. The only solution to this problem is to use a sound system with better power supply filtering.""In no event will PowerBrightTM be responsible for any amount of damages beyond the amount paid for the product at retail."Online descriptions, including the manufacturer home page, give no indication of the above important information.If you are looking for an inverter for the above purposes you will want to look into a PURE sine wave inverter.  Make sure you also review the power requirements on your device before you buy the inverter as well.  Underpowered inverters can be harmful to your devices. I have installed a transmission cooler in my FJ Cruiser and use this scan tool/gauge to monitor the transmission temperatures in the pan and at the converter control valve sensor. Having the rig set up for towing, this product is a very valuable asset, plus you can watch various other parameters and sensor reading, MPG`s, etc etc and use it also as a scan tool...Excellent product! 
It does what it is supposed to do, that is to increase placement distance from the car to the electrical outlet Great wheel lock that is easy to activate and unlock.  It comes with 3 keys, one of which has a LED light on it.  The product also comes with a reminder cord that attaches to the handle bar as a reminder.  It does just what I was looking for. A must have to replace oxygen sensors. Makes the process so easy that even a caveman can do it. The sensors were in a unreachable spot to use a wrench so this socket really came in handy. 
Does what it says it does......looks great ! As others have noted, the picture shows it to be MUCH darker than it really is.  It does help tone down my state-issued YELLOW plate though, so it serves its purpose somewhat. These item does fit perfect on my 2004 BMW x3. does what its suppose to do. so far so good thanks 
How do you rate these?  They do exactly what they are supposed to do.  What more can I say.  It don't stink no more?!  LOL I probably should compare it to another to see how accurate it is, but I really like how easy it is to use and turns off and on by itself. Sorry to say, I  have never used the sewer hose support as of yet.  So  I can not really say how good it is. I guess it is a great hose support if you have to use it.  Sorry, can not say how it works 
Perfect for washing the RV...strong pole you can scrub as high as you need to go or can leverage. Holds its position when set.  Very pleased. Great tool for clamping hard to reach radiator hose clamps.  Its multi-position locking mechanism will make sure to clamp and hold various sized clamps- unlike other pliers that can only hold in the fully close position. Mitt holds lots of water and both sides can be used as it is a flat style with cuff. 
i use this in addition to my built-in RV water filter.  we used it to fill our freshwater tank at home so that we had familiar and clean water at the RV park.  couldn't tell the difference between &#34;RV&#34; water and drinking from home faucet.  CAUTION: be sure to rinse out the carbon before using it--squirt water through the filter and you'll see lots of carbon residue... continue until the water is clear (only a few seconds) and then you're good to go. This filter is a must have if you want to have water that is clean and as pure as your home filtered water. I believe that by using this filter the water that we will get from the different campsights will be as close to home aas possible. Easy to use and store a must have for those who are concerned about what they drink. I use this filter to fill up my 45 gallon water tank as well as using it inline on the city water connection.  That way I'm assured fresh, clean water if I'm dry-camping or at a FHU campsite!  Sometimes I go the extra distance to fill up a couple of Britta Water Filter bottles and put them in the fridge for cold, fresh water! 
Bought this along with a No Spill 5 gallon can to use for track days. THe length is excellent and gets down into the filler of your car. It also fits in a 1 gallon freezer bag so you can seal it up and put it back in the trunk when done without smelling gas or getting it on your trunk carpet. Two improvements would make this a 5 star funnel. 1) It should be slightly upturned at the opening to catch gas as it backs up 2) The diameter of the nozzle should be larger and it easily could be given the tank inlet size - would allow faster filling. I needed a large funnel for adding an ammonia solution to a container for a diesel engine (DEF cannister) and did not want to try to empty a 2.5 gal container of the solution into the engine compartment and having the ammonia all over the place.The Hopkins funnel is large enough that it is an easy target for the liquid being used and it has a grip area so that if you have average size hands it is easy to hold on to it. If you have small hands the design is not going to work particularly well but it can be held by the rear section. Bought this to replace a cap with a broken latch.  It fits nice and tight and you can use an old garden hose to drain the gray water.If you need a cap, buy this one. 
Very good product.  Now my wife can pull into the garage without backing up and maneuvering her car to get it right.  Easy to install.  As a point of reference for her, I put a small &#34;cupboard door&#34; disc on the dash.  When we pull the car in all she needs to do is get the light to be within an inch of the &#34;cupboard door&#34; disc on the dash 360 degrees and the car is parked perfect.  Our garage is a 3 car one, but with my car, motor cycle, large mower, tools, tool chest, garbage cans, lawn equipment, wall cabinets,  etc....we need to make sure we manage the space.  And now we have more space. Very nice filter media that fit directly into the old fixture that I pulled out from behind the glove box.  It literally took me 2 minutes and saved me $65.  2009 Accord - open the glove box and push forward on the clip on the right hand side of the open glove box, squeeze the glove box on the left and right in an inward direction and the box will drop down to expose the filter behind the glove box...so easy.  Reverse to re-install Positioned 2 of these fore and aft of the optimul wheel location - haven't backed into the bikes or lowered the garage door on the bumper since! 
Not only do they not fit, very thin and wonder how long they will last.  Also if you have batteries with the post and screw/nut the latter is not covered. The quality of this tool appears good. Fit and finish are nice, and the steel base looks forged and not cast. The screw turns smoothly even if the handle is a bit sharpHowever the throat of this tool is not deep enough to get over what look liike normal sized wiper arms on my 2012 Jetta SportWagan. When placed on the arm the center of the threaded rod only reaches to the edge of the wiper arm stud. I got the tool to work but it involved leaving the wiper arm nut on the stud about 4 turns loose and placing a thick steel washer on top of the nut to make a flat surface for the puller stud to press against. Everything about these jack stands speaks to quality.  These jacks stands are very well made of heavy gauge aluminum with a hardened steel pin with a bearing lock for the height adjustment.  Some light assembly with a flat head screw driver is required before use.  There's a screw (provided) that threads into the bottom of the base to fasten the stand support (red) and base together.  Another reviewer stated that his stand 'wobbled'. While it's possible that reviewers stand was defective, if the screw is threaded into the hole and tightened down firmly into the base, the stand won't wobble. On my SUV vehicle, the jack points are very close together, so the base of a tripod-style jack stand is too wide for use.  The narrow profile of these stands is perfect and allows me to slip the jack stand behind the jack and under the rear jack point. Once in position, remove the pin, adjust the height and reinsert the pin. I also don't care for the ratchet style jack stands, which have been known to fail.  There are lots of low priced jack stands on the market, but when it comes to safety (yours), spend a few extra dollars are get a pair of these pin-thru aluminum jack stands by Torin.  They work extremely well and they look cool too. 
Screws are very soft and are easy to strip and not stainless.Plate is flimsy so think thoroughly about how to secure it best First of all, THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS A MOUNTING BRACKET! For the first time ever, I didn't read reviews here before purchasing and bought a separate mounting bracket which Amazon lists as "frequently purchased together". On the flip side though, I doubled up the brackets to make them a bit more sturdy. The bracket will bend backwards from the force of pushing the 7 pin plug in otherwise.The adapter itself is made of a thick plastic so corrosion shouldn't be an issue. Both covers work well and should keep out the elements though dielectric grease should be used as well. The wires are heavy (enough) gauge and have good jackets to them and the included crimp connectors are a nice bonus, though I always recommend soldering them.My only complaint is the cheap screws that come with it. Everything needed to mount it is included but it's very soft steel and strips with little effort. Do yourself a favor and pick up some nice stainless screws at least for where it mounts to the vehicle. Truly does exceed expectations.  Perfect size.  Keeps the nuts/bolts together with the sockets and screwdriver tips. As others have noted, the magnets are really strong and can hold bigger items as well as smaller items.  And finally, since its magnetic, it can be easily stored out of the way (with nuts) by slapping on the side of a metal tool chest. 
This air gauge is dead on accurate, it seals completely, allows air to flow the way it should and the two headed chuck fit all cars, trucks and even those pesky hard to reach motorcycle valve stems. I own three motorcycles and there is nothing more aggravating than trying to fit a chuck in between rotors, fork tubes and tight spaces on a motorcycle. You know what I mean. This two headed angled chuck is angled perfectly to fit over a cycle stem without leaking or having to bend the valve stem. I love it. I have two cars, both of which require the large #14 sheet metal self-tapping screws to mount the plate to the nylon retainers behind the plate (the ones mounted on the car that the screws screw into). Problem is that diameter of the plastic ring that holds the screw covers is too small to take the screw's large diameter head. The maximum screw head diameter that will fit the ring is .435 inch (11 millimeters). Option 1: Replace the nylon retainers on the car, but different cars have different retainers so one must search for new ones that will accept a #12 screw. Option 2: Try to find #14 self-tapping screws with smaller heads. I shopped around for #14 screws with smaller heads to no avail. Option 3: Grind down the screw head's diameter. Option 4 (not good): On one car I used #12 sheet metal screws that have a smaller diameter, but DO fit the rings, and wrapped the threads with tape. This sort of works, but I really can't tighten them down satisfactorily. So I have to check their security now and then. I'm leaving the other car as is for now. Maybe someone has more practical ideas? Sure would like to hear of them. BTW, SEE THE UPDATE BELOW.UPDATE 11/16/13:I think I've found a viable solution to the above problem. I used a #12 sheet metal self-tapping screw, placed a 1/2-inch long piece of ordinary shrink tubing (1/4" i.d.) over the threads towards the pointed end of the screw. Used a heat gun (or you can use a match, BIC lighter or soldering iron) to shrink the tubing which effectively increases the thread diameter to about that of a #14 screw. This allows me to tighten the screw securely and will last much longer than ordinary tape. One more thing: The THICKNESS of the screw head doesn't quite allow the chrome cap to fully snap into place over the nylon ring. The top of the head needs to be filed down a little leaving enough Philips "X" to use the screwdriver. I bought this valve with high hopes of simplifying the regular draining of our 6-gal Atwood RV water heater, as removal of the standard nylon plug is a pain due to its location.  If you are looking to purchase this product under the same pretense, let me save you the time -- in my case, the better part of an afternoon.First, a quick explanation of how the valve works -- there are actually three components at play: 1) the large diameter plug that screws into the water heater, 2) a secondary plug that screws into the first, and 3) the actual valve which you open and close to drain the water.  I believe the intent of this design is to allow &#34;regular&#34; draining of the water heater with the last/smallest valve, while removal of the medium nut could be used perhaps at the end of the season to allow more sediment and debris to exit the tank quickly (due to the larger diameter).  Sidenote: opening the actual valve (the smallest component) drains the tank very, very slowly, and sometimes only at a trickle if you can't get air behind the water -- in my case, I had to open the pressure relief valve (in addition to all faucets) to produce an acceptable drain rate.While the valve piece never had any issues with leaking, the other components did.  I tried screwing in these nuts with and without Teflon tape, and at various depths.  No matter what the combination, there was always a small leak coming from either of these pieces.  There appeared to be no way to practically stop the leaking.  I also tried wrapping the nuts with an excess of Teflon tape (5+ wraps), to no avail.I gave up after about 2-3 hours of tinkering, returned the valve to Amazon, and ended up sticking with the standard nylon plug.  Hint: Sears sells a 15/16 offset wrench that is perfect for removing these plugs. 
I put these in my '03 TJ Jeep Wrangler.  They fit perfect and work exactly as you'd expect they should.  I installed a set of 55w HIDs in them and the light output is tremendous. This doesn't fit my 2007 Toyota Tacoma factory hitch.  It needs to be 2 7/8".  The package on this lock reads 2 5/8 but I measured it at 2 3/4.  I'm going to have to grind the bolt.Update, Jan 2014.  An noted I had to grind the inside ends to make this fit in my Tacoma OEM hitch.  Once, it was ground to the proper length, I spray-painted the bolt and have used it to haul a 19-foot trailer and attach my tow hook ever since with no further problems. I underestimate the size of this level (although it was stated in the specs): I was expecting a small bulls-eye level, around 1" in diameter. This thing is 4 times the size! But regardless, it works as it is supposed to. I've contemplated mounting it to our travel trailer via the screw-holes or double sided tape but haven't just yet. I want to make sure the thing will hold up to some weathered-use before I drill holes into a metal component. Not bad for &lt;$4 (at the time of this review). 
The size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous. The funnel is 10" long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6" long. It states that the funnel is 4" x 4" but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2-1/4" in diameter at the widest point.It would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless. These were a perfect fit for my 2001 Silverado 2500HD with the 6.0 but I had to do some research to make sure I bought the correct wire set.  GM used round or square coils (two different manufacturers) for a few years and the plug wire lengths are different. If you have the round coils (plug wire connector on the bottom of the coil) you need these shorter wires ending in &#34;GG&#34;.  If you have the square coils with the plug wire connector on the side of the coil, you need the longer wires ending in &#34;HH&#34;. The HH wires are about 1.5 inches longer for than the GG's.  You cannot make the shorter wires reach a square coil. Easy to replace. It lacks Toyota instructions, but it is exactly like existing Toyota part with all wires colored the same way so it is very obvious how to connect those.The original part has a silicone rubber tube going all the way from top to bottom with wires running inside it. This part only provides a short length of tubing that, at best, would cover half of the length of wires on my car.I thing they should provide a &#34;telescoping&#34; tubing of two diameters with one going inside of the other while you are crimping wires and then extended to cover the full length of wires 
Easy to install. I used my own screws because of the material that I was mounting the bracket on. I had to tape one of the light adapter plugs as it was a loose fit in the bracket. This is the OEM cabin air filter for the 2006 Acura TL, and trust me: this thing does what it's supposed to do. I couldn't believe how much crud this thing had caught between the B12 service on my girlfriend's 2006 TL.One thing I will say is that this is a PITA to replace. After disconnecting the glove compartment door and removing the two screws and push fittings securing the assembly to the console, pull the console down. Directly down. That means sit in the passenger seat and apply equal force to both sides of the assembly... or you'll break a tab and your interior will never be the same. I've seen two people make the mistake of busting the tabs loose right to left. Don't be another. Not much to say, other than to let people know these work on Ford vehicles.I installed them on my Truck and my wife's Escape.  Both vehicles only use 2 screws so I was able to use one package for the 2 vehicles.On my truck I took the extra time to reach behind and put the white plastic "nut" on the end of the screw (on the tip of the screw that stuck through the bumper).  This will make it pretty much impossible to remove the screws without holding onto the nut.(I think the white plastic thing is actually meant as a bushing for larger holes???)For my wife's escape I couldn't reach the back side of the screw without take apart the hatch so I just put the screws in.Like others have said, this isn't "bulletproof" - but it will deter theft.  I could take out the old screws with my pocketknife so anyone walking by could steal the license plate in about 10 seconds time.  This will prevent that type of theft... 
This is put together well. Not sure why I would need it but just in case I want to run an inverter off of a 12 vdc battery then I can Its what the owners manual for a 2012 acura mdx required, and i needed it just in case when i am up in the mountains, i need to chain up...never used it yet...but good to know i have it ready to go if needed. Exactly what I needed to add to my box of wheelin components, I'll save a tree when I need to hook up & pull &#34;other&#34; people out 
easy installation. put them on the rear sides.good construction.grip feels a little on the small side.good enough for what it is. Looks like a nice accessory to help climb in my lifted jeep, but really is no help. Okay for your passenger to hold onto going around curves, but thats about all they are good for. (They are well built with good material) Clips are pretty good, the short protection fuse is a nice touch. the end cap is odd for a removable clip all and all pretty good. 
These were a perfect fit for my 2001 Silverado 2500HD with the 6.0 but I had to do some research to make sure I bought the correct wire set.  GM used round or square coils (two different manufacturers) for a few years and the plug wire lengths are different. If you have the round coils (plug wire connector on the bottom of the coil) you need these shorter wires ending in &#34;GG&#34;.  If you have the square coils with the plug wire connector on the side of the coil, you need the longer wires ending in &#34;HH&#34;. The HH wires are about 1.5 inches longer for than the GG's.  You cannot make the shorter wires reach a square coil. RV orginal hose was leaking from metal to rubber hose area. I had to also buy an adaptor becasue the small end was not the same size. Found one at an RV parts store for .99 cents. There are two horns, not one. One is 400Hz and the other one is 500Hz.PIAA | Automotive Sports Horn (400/500Hz) #85110The are exact fits on the mounts as the OEM horns and use the same bolts. A 1/4 inch drive ratchet and a 12mm socket is needed to remove and install the bolt. They came with grounding leads with ring spade lugs that mounted readily under the existing M6 bolts on the radiator supports. All you need is a 10mm socket.The two wiring harness leads are too short to connect the horns. Two wire tie mounts hold the harness to the aluminum bumper reinforcement. You can cut off the ties and use the OEM harness to connect the horns, but I chose not to.  I prefer NOT to cut off the OEM connector blocks.I made two pigtail extensions out of 18 gauge black primary wire, 5 inches long. One end needs a 1/4 inch wide exposed male quick disconnect. The other end needs an insulated female 1/4 inch quick disconnect terminal. Since I used 18 gauge wire, I used the red coded ones.The exposed male connector slides into the OEM horn connector perfectly. The female one clips easily onto the positive terminal of each horn.The horns how have a weather shield on the apertures.Best thing to my surprise is that they appear to be very high quality and Made in Japan.Also nice is that they need no modification to the horn relay or circuit. 
These work extremely well, have one on each end,  front and back of wheels ( 4), took 95% of the movement out of trailer. The &#34;feet&#34; on this bar slides off the truck bed sides and makes it worthless.When the ratchet is extended, the mechanism for that ends up out of arms reach when standing outside the truck. allows me to keep my charger in the garage, and my lower in the back of my house. 25' is just the right lenght, and the end has a cover so i can hang the cood out side and not worry about rain. 
These scrapers always break at the smallest part of the handle right behind the head. I heated up a length of 3/4 PVC conduit and slid it over the entire handle,allowing it to spread out slightly at the scraper head. Works like a charm, and now it's long enough to reach the center of my truck windshield! The small size of this drainer is perfect for any camper.  The little cut-out on the bottom fits over the edge of the sink. These tie downs are the cat's meow.The built in hook and loop on the handlebar end is great.Much easier to operate than plain &#34;soft tie&#34; straps.The ratchet works well and is not temperamental.Perfect width at 1.5&#34; and that gives confidence for the durability over skinny 1&#34; straps.Held down my heavy Harley just fine, over sometimes not so smooth roadways. 
These horns are just the ticket in replacing stock inferior horns. These are a much nicer sounding horn than the loud blast of an air horn. Perfect horns to boost the warning ability of your vehicle without sounding like a Big Rig. Works great, installed it on my motorcycle and also kept the high tone stock horn.  With both horns the sound is VERY loud, it will scare the crap out of any dummies that pull out in front of me now.85db stock horn91db stock horn + FiammIf you understand how decibel measurement works you will know that is a big increase in sound. My 2007 Toyota FJ Cruiser's stock horn was, well, pretty pathetic.  A single horn that wasn't very loud and would easily get lost on the highway - and it's amazing how many people are unable to see that bright yellow SUV so a horn that works is cruicial to my survival.  The PIAA horns dropped in with very little work - the FJ is wired for a second horn, so all you need are a couple of electrical tips, about 3 feet of copper wire, and a 10mm bolt and you can put the pair of these in front of your radiator where they'll do the most good - most other cars, I suspect, will have similarly easy installations.  The difference in volume was immediately noticeable.  They're not train horns, and they won't make your ears bleed, but they're appropriately loud car horns that install easily. 
The size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous. The funnel is 10" long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6" long. It states that the funnel is 4" x 4" but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2-1/4" in diameter at the widest point.It would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless. 32mm is the correct size for my Jetta TDI oil cap, and this fits perfectly.It's also fairly low profile, another plus. a regular 32mm socket will not fit in the space of my equinox. this is a kind of shorter 32mm socket designed only for oil filter cap job. it works fine. 
Works good, installed on my 2012 Kaw Voyager 1700. I installed the unit on the bolt off the left side of radiator box. Use the the bracket from orginal horn to make that work, sound awesome too. I bought both the driver's and passenger side regulators when I installed factory power windows and mirrors in my 2000 Sierra. I wanted new parts because I didn't trust the regulators from the donor truck I used for parts to complete this project. The regulators installed perfectly and worked just like they would if my truck came from the factory with power windows.Pick up a pair if you are converting your truck over or replacing the factory worn-out regulators. You won't be disappointed. Almost too bright, but I love it.  Maybe the 100 watt model would be better than these 130's if your eyes are sensitive to bright lights.  Exactly what my 2004 Dodge Ram needed because the factory headlights stink.  My brights were no brighter than my low beam, and my old 1985 Nissan had brighter brights, but these KC 130 watt driving lights solved that problem perfectly.  For not being the full, long range lights KC offers, they sure shine pretty far, plus spread the light out to the sides and up into the trees, a good long range / flood combination.  I mounted them to my push/brush guard.  Took about 3 hours to install because I like to route, hide, and secure the wires very well.  I connected the white switch / relay hot wire to my high beam (brights)wire on the drivers side, so they go on and off with my high / low switch, plus I have the master switch mounted (without the switch frame) near the dash to keep the KC lights off completely if I want.  Just make sure you dim your lights (turn off the KC's) before you see anyone ahead of you or you'll blind them and can get a ticket if on a public road.  First night I tried them a big 8 point ran across the road in front of me, then stopped and pretty much "tip toed" off the road as if he was totally blind and afraid to move.  So beware of animals freezing in front of you with these things.  I turned them off and honked so he could run away.  And no, I don't hunt that way.The wiring diagram on the outside of the box did not show the white power / relay wire, as if it was pre-wired into the main power wire, but luckily there was the white power / relay wire available to tap into my high beam wire.  The wiring diagram on the directions in the box was correct.  Some vehicles newer than 1999 may not allow tapping into the high beam wire because of the vehicle's computer that senses voltage changes, but it worked on mine.  Only thing I had to supply was a sheet metal screw to secure the relay.  I cut off about 5 feet of extra wire that went to the switch.  The length of wire to the lights was just right. 
Again, these guys are hard to do without.  They are doing the job!  I don't buy the 3-pack, I prefer to buy the individuals in quantities of 3 because, for some reason, I get free shipping on the individual ones, but not on the multi pack one.  So, it came out cheaper to buy them a la carte.  Go Figure! After looking online at &#34;ready-made&#34; emergency auto kits, I made up emergency bags of my own for my kids' trunks, just in case the MN roads got the best of them.  The pre-made kits were either too expensive and filled with the cheapest junk, or they just didn't have an intelligent assortment of things I know people need (from experience).  Many of those kits were labeled by AAA.  So, strangely when I went looking for a first aid kit with something more than band-aids and rubber gloves (who really needs those, anyway?), I found this, complete with gauze and tape and stuff you need in the real-world if you get stuck, stranded, or hurt.  I wanted to go a little bigger with other things like peroxide and cold compress, but it was cheaper to buy those separately and just go with this kit. Have not yet needed to use them, bought them for when I do need them. I am however, very impressed with the quality of the cables. The bag they came in is durable, handy, convenient & good quality. The price was outstanding for these cables. They are low profile to ensure that they do not rub on the wheel well. Only issue I had, was attempting to purchase another set of the rubber tensioner in case one breaks. Amazon did not seem to offer more than one size, which of course was not the size I needed. Most reviews caution you to have an extra, or you could find yourself in trouble if one side breaks. So if anyone knows where to buy extra tensioners, please let me know. 
with plastic bumpers being the norm, thought I'd use this plastic polish.  It brings the shine to the plastic painted areas just like step 2 does to the metal. I purchased these items more for style than function.  They do look great, but are not made of high quality components.  The metal seems stamped, and the attachment screws look like wood screws instead of the original metal screws.  Easy to install.  I wish that they would have been offered in flat black. Screws are very soft and are easy to strip and not stainless.Plate is flimsy so think thoroughly about how to secure it best 
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. 
I put these in my '03 TJ Jeep Wrangler.  They fit perfect and work exactly as you'd expect they should.  I installed a set of 55w HIDs in them and the light output is tremendous. The provided foam spacers and fit was perfect on my 2013 JEEP OEM hitch receiver.  Sturdy and well made.  The one I received had round corners so I did not have to 'modify' it as some other's stated they had to do.  I will not leave this permanently in my hitch and the weather, since there is potential for moisture to get into it.  If you put keys in this I'd suggest a zip log bag.  There are two holes in the back of the unit which I suspect is to allow moisture to escape, I thought about using Silicone RTV to close those up, but decided against it.  Weather, and especially near coastal areas, will probably corrode the combo lock at some point so I will not leave it permanently installed, and will keep in my cab until I need it. These don't fit quite right onto the stems of my Pirelli P-Zero's. The dealership neglected to put a cap back on my tire -- so I bought these just in case. They get the job done, but don't expect them to look or fit the same.

Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!!

Haven't used this yet, but sometime in the future I will be changing plugs on my truck. First time I've seen one of these so got it, so l have it for that job. This is a very solid product.  I had purchased another brand that claimed to be 'universal' but it did not fit the larger Airstream coupler.  The product fit although I did have to turn it backward (key hole facing the trailer).

Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. I wish there was a guide somewhere that shows you what cars these sunshades fit. I bought this one (Super Jumbo) for my Toyota Camry, hoping it would fit. Well, it did not fit. I had to return it, and order the regular Jumbo sunshade. The regular Jumbo sunshade fits the windshield like a glove. Quality is good, and it folds up to about 14&#34;. So, if you have a 2007-2013 Toyota Camry, DO NOT BUY THIS ONE!!! Order the regular Jumbo size.Amazon, can you please look into getting some sort of reference guide that will show customers the correct vehicle application? This would make buying this product a whole lot easier.CPS

because, I have not used these yet.  I know they will be quite wonderful when I do need to use them They work just great for what I want.  I have two sets of them that I use on my travel trailer.  Will buy two more sets when the others that I use wear out. You can really use these cloths for anything. I use them in the kitchen to wipe hands instead of wasting paper towels. I also use them on my car. The quality is good and they hold up to washing with no problem. I've seen one of these in the auto store for $5 each. Good deal here. 
The size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous. The funnel is 10" long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6" long. It states that the funnel is 4" x 4" but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2-1/4" in diameter at the widest point.It would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless. would recommend getting a  size  smaller than  what the  &#34;sizing chart&#34; recommends  as  I  measure aroun my leg  as  recommended  and  the chaps  were  one size too large.. otherwise they are  awesome  quality and build The meter has all the functions you could ask for a multimeter in a compact size.  The digits are large for the size of the meter, so it's easily readable by middle aged eyes. 
Easy to replace. It lacks Toyota instructions, but it is exactly like existing Toyota part with all wires colored the same way so it is very obvious how to connect those.The original part has a silicone rubber tube going all the way from top to bottom with wires running inside it. This part only provides a short length of tubing that, at best, would cover half of the length of wires on my car.I thing they should provide a &#34;telescoping&#34; tubing of two diameters with one going inside of the other while you are crimping wires and then extended to cover the full length of wires The size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous. The funnel is 10" long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6" long. It states that the funnel is 4" x 4" but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2-1/4" in diameter at the widest point.It would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless. Great feeler gauge!Equip it in Corrosion-X, or WD40 for long lasting.Great to measure spark plug gaps, for performing valve adjustments (valve gap), etc... 
These are almost identical to the ones I've rented from Autozone in the past.  I decided to get my own set for sheer convenience.  The work well for the passenger cars--don't know about any other type of coil springs.  Can be tricky on progressive springs with lots of coils on the ends. because you need to have room in between coils for these to fit.  Also, it should be obvious but these are to be applied on coils only.  Attaching one end to the strut mounts or top cap is a recipe for disaster. One thing about cabin air filter replacement is to make sure you are ready for a &#34;not&#34; so easy task for a Mazda 3. Very intense labor which includes removing a fuse panel and the bracket that it attaches to just to get to the screws that hold the end cap that covers the filters. I would highly recommend TYC brand cabin filters. Their cataloging is correct as well as their instructions. I have used this brand on 2 Nissans and this Mazda 3. The other reviewer must have had a fluke. I have two of these, and they are very reliable. The caps screw on fine. The only issue is the retaining tab on the lid will break over time. I actually consider this a benefit, as with the tab broken you can remove the cap, versus having it dangle. It's easier to fill and empty with the lid fully removed instead of dangling and potentially getting in the oil stream. It's not like you're likely to misplace the lid. All in all, these are very handy. 
MY EXPERIENCE: One of the things I really like about this funnel, is how long it is. It can literally reach down inside an automotive engine with ease, so that I can pour new oil into the crankcase, without getting it all over the engine, which could cause an oil fire!The bottom of the funnel is narrow for the first 6 inches. Which means, I can get it into a tractor dipstick tube, and effortlessly add oil. Because of the total length of the funnel, I am able to add more oil at a time, without worrying about spilling out of the funnel.Because of this same feature, I am able to put it through the filler hole of a vehicle gas tank, and it will stay there, and then I can pickup my gas can, and add a couple gallons of gas to the tank.OTHER USES: Here is another use, many of you may have not thought of. With a small mower, to drain the oil, all you have to do is tip the mower to its side, and let it drain into a pan. However, you can't do this with a tractor, because the engine is mounted to the tractor frame. So, I cant get a pan under the frame because there is my right side wheel in the way. After I attach my drain tube to the drain valve on my engine, I then take the Super Funnel, and place the tube into it, and then the funnel, into the oil pan. There you go, draining made simple!CONCLUSION: Though, I had to spend more then I would for any regular funnel, it is well worth the cost I spent on it, when I consider what uses I can get out of it. Like I said, tiny funnels are great for small things, but for larger engines, you need to get serious. I just love my Super Funnel, and if you buy one, you will too! 5 out of 5 First I must say I hate purchasing tools that only do one thing...(uni-tasker).  I purchased this socket tool, becouse I had to.  Not becase I wanted to, but quickly found out I need another socket to turn it... and here's the kicker.  The socket is bigger then standard set 19mm or 3/4!  So you have go out and purchase a 15/16 or 24mm socket, which is a huge socket.  I will never use this socket unless I own a diesel truck.  Add that to the cost of the wrench. So about 8 dollars for the socket and the price of tool, just to get started.  The oil filter wasn't on too tight, so the cheaper plastic tool worked out just fine for me.  The 24mm socket stays on the aluminum tool and should ship like that.  Waste of time and money for a tool that only does one task.... Like others said, the inflator is loud and vibrates like there is no tomorrow, but it is supposed to be used on the road in situations that do not happen too often; compressors and inflators more suited for daily use are out there. I carry this one on motorcycle excursions and I only had to use it two times. Both times it'd got the job done. I might say that the thing serves me well. I also want to say that form what I see, designers hadn't cut too many corners. The hose is replaceable; the nozzle on the hose looks cheap but works surprisingly well and does not leak air when I put it on and off the valve, like did the nozzles on Craftsman inflators that I had.I especially like the use of SAE power connectors everywhere. I'd simply replaced the included cigarette lighter/SAE adapter with a Powerlet/SAE one that plugs into the Powerlet socket on my motorcycle. Some thought had obviously been given to the length of the power cord -- it is neither too long, nor too short, just the right length for virtually any motorcycle.Powerlet Basic Plug To SAE 12" Cable (Garage Duty) 
I qualify 5 stars because it would be unfair to give a bad reputation, I purchased this product on September 27, I Bought 2 Armor extreme shine, I live in South America so I need an address where my purchases must arrived in the united States and then send to my country. My courier company said that they couldn&#8217;t transport Aerosol or contents under pressure because is a dangerous goods. I had to declare the product as abandoned, I lost my purchase. I will not be able to watch my shiny wheels, I'm sad about that, but I'm sure it's an excellent product because I have purchased other products of &#8220;Armor all&#8221; that are not dangerous goods and arrived without problems to my country where I check the good quality of their products. When I ordered this, I was guaranteed fitment on a Toyota 3S-FE engine. When it arrived, it was not the correct size. i left two stars because I did run out and buy the correct size from another store, however, I didnt want to have to do this when I had all the rest of my parts shipped in. Before purchasing this item I called the manufacturer to be sure it did what I wanted.  They said it would but it did not.  i called them back and they said it was capable of what I wanted but I would have to program it for it to work.  Not what you read on the package, not what the manufacturer said, and directions so poor I could not beging to program it and I'm a geek. 
These horns are just the ticket in replacing stock inferior horns. These are a much nicer sounding horn than the loud blast of an air horn. Perfect horns to boost the warning ability of your vehicle without sounding like a Big Rig. First, you will need to buy the high tone also, or it will sound stupid. It is part #72102. I have put these pair on my last 4 cars. The low tone does have a habit of failing if it gets wet. This has happened twice to me. For some reason, the high tone works fine if it gets wet. Make sure you mount the low tone in a location where it will not get wet.The kit does not include a relay. You may want to install a relay, especially if your car is wired for one horn. The horns draw 4.5A each at 12V. This is usually within factory limits and most fuseboxes will have a 10A or larger relay built in the horn circuit. The kit does include 3 female blade connectors, a mounting bracket and nut, and a jumper wire (needed if your car is wired with one horn lead).And, they are very loud. Packaging declares 130db at 4 inches. I do not have a db meter, but I can assure you the horns will get the job done. The pair has a nice tone, and will rid your car of the little factory &#34;meep meep&#34; horns. Needed something to plug into my 25&#34; camping travel trailer to monitor my 2, 6-volt (connected in series to make one large long lasting 12v battery) batteries .... This thing worked PERFECT! When you turn anything on it register the drop in voltage and just seems to show the correct battery level perfectly at all times. It drops down to yellow when you kick on the heater and what not but that just means it is showing you where the levels are at with that kind of load. Makes monitoring my batteries Simple As Can Be! 
I welded a piece of flat stock on the insert for the motorhome. This adapter is for my Dodge Grand Caravan. These worked for my 2005 jeep grand cherokee.  I like how these bulbs will replace any of the three rear lights. I mounted this as an auxiliary transmission cooler in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 with the 4.0.  No issues.  Obviously, this was a custom installation.  But with a little research on the jeep forums, no problem. 
This is one-size-fits-most. It works on the filter for my 2002 Volkswagen Passat, but it's too large to grip the filter on my 1993 Chevrolet S10. Works great. Fairly easy swap.

The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones.

Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. This works great. It's sturdy and fit's nice and snug in a standard 5 gallon bucket. I will be ordering more of these in the future.

I installed this horn on a Miata. The silly "beep" horn is thankfully gone. This horn is cheap, loud, and easy to install. I was hoping for a higher pitch; this horn sounds very similar to the horns found in full size sedans. For the price, I really can't complain too much. 
Arrived on time and in great shape! It does stop the car wheel as it said it would.  As I purchase a new larger auto I only have about 8 inches, (4" clearance for the front and back) left in the garage when I bring in the auto.  A little nervous the 1st time so I S-L-O-W-L-Y inched forward then would stop, get out and look, and repeated a few times until the wheel touched it, then got out and saw I had the 4 " front/back.  Now I drive in normally and it stops me at the location I need... POWERFULI have a full sized 4wd pickup truck 5.7 L V8 engine.  When the battery went dead over at my parents house their jumper cables from their car wouldn't give enough juice to start my truck.  My dad put his charger on my battery overnight but still the truck wouldn't start.All the technical diagnostic advice I got from everyone was wonderful but I know what a dead battery is and I was sure that was the problem.Since I left my JNC jump box in my other vehicle I came back the next day and said let's give it a try with my &#34;jump box&#34;.  Needless to say it fired right up.The battery was truly dead and would not take a charge whatsoever.Jumper cables from another &#34;smaller&#34; vehicle would not supply enough cranking amps to start my truck... but the JNC had power to spare.I have used it several times over the past year and a half since I made my purchase.  It has not failed me.  I have used it to start my lawn mower, my tractor, my neighbors car, and even some stranger in the parking lot. Buy this right now.  I had a performance K&N; filter set-up on my Acura, but for some reason it never occurred to me to put a K&N; filter on my commuter car.  It popped up as a suggestion, and I purchased it immediately.  Right away I noticed snappier acceleration.  At the end of my 22 mile commute my mileage had already improved .5 mpg without resetting the computer.  I am floored.  I am fresh out of a dyno so I don't know if my HP increased, but based on my other two observations, combined with this being a lifetime product, I am ecstatic about this filter.Now, a little story about replacing my old filter with the K&N.;  I thought I was just going to open the air box, yank out the old one, slap in the K&N;, and then go about my day.  WRONG.  Big ol' thumbs down for Nissan making routine task a big undertaking.  If you have an Altima you had better get out your awesomeStanley 92-839 Black Chrome and Laser Etched Socket Set, 99-Piece.  Use your short 10mm and remove the intake hose from where it attaches to the box.  Then you can unclip the front clips, and the lid flips up.  You can unclip the sensor, but I did not.  Thank goodness I do not have to do that again for another 50,000 miles. 
Just as it says.  Easy to install, is good quality and functions just as it should.  To install, all that has to be done is to remove the four screws holding the fuel filler area finish ring in place.  The ring does not have to be removed.  Place the cover in place and use the provided screws to secure the cover.  That easy! This rotor seems OK, but the original is held in place by a screw that is under a plastic dust cover.  So, how do I remove the rotor? Nice brush.  Does what it is made to do and cleanup is easy.  Which the handle was longer so I could get deeper into the drum. 
Fit my '98 Nissan Frontier's oil pan perfectly. Looks to be of nice quality.  Torque to 25ft/lbs (on the Frontier anyway) Works great on my 2012 Wrangler Sport. Heavy duty rubber that fits well in my hitch receiver and looks like it will last awhile. Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. 
Sets under the left side frame rail under the drivers door. (2005 Ford F150) ... If you have the proper filter wrench it's a very fast job. ...fits my 1973 Chevy/GMC 4x4 steering wheel perfect. Stretch it over the wheel and wrap the vinyl string around it nice and tight. The vinyl will break so just stretch it a little. 3 things.#1 Spring is cheep and installed incorrectly. Snapped on unpacking so i had to twist it to place it the right (better) way and twist the ends toward inside more, because spring is made of cheep metal that bends like aluminum.#2 Size is too big for regular car filters. Toyotas/Hondas/Motorcycles ETC. Maybe a 5Lite For 3500 utility van will have enough filter diameter for this to fit around, or a huge SUV or a pickup truck.#3 Removal only. does not work the other way around to tight the filter. 
Hi All.There is not a whole lot you can say about a "Plastic Bag Holder"  It does do as it says it does, and that is a place to stroe your Plastic Bags in your RV.  Its neat and orderly to use.  Only real issues, is look at the size of your RV's Cabinet Doors and measure before you do buy this Plastic Bag Holder.  It is made very well for what it is.  Its a very Heavy Duty Plastic made holder.  I was a little surprized at the size of it.  I too, should have measured.  But it did work out for us, as we have faily large Cabint Doors in our Motorhome.  You could also mount it inside of a Cabinet or on a Closet Wall, out of the way also.  And it does hold a fair amount of Plastic bags, for later use.  Happy Travels. The size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous. The funnel is 10" long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6" long. It states that the funnel is 4" x 4" but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2-1/4" in diameter at the widest point.It would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless. Sizes listed in reviews and the two in the description (15.8 x 10.5 x 5, and 12.5 x 9.5 x 7) don't match to what I received...The bag I received is in between what has been listed in the descriptions:  13.5" x 9" x 6" (empty).While seemingly a good quality bag, with a fair amount of straps and attached rain-cover (hidden in the heel of the bag), it seems the manufacturer (or seller) has no idea how to use a measuring tape!The bag itself is quite nice... good padding, rubberized bottom to prevent sliding, small pockets on either side, and zippers seem of reasonable quality.For the price and bag quality, I'm not complaining.  It works great on my CB750, and it does fit on the pillion of my VT1100c2 (without having to remove my rider backrest)  So if you have standard seating (or a touring/adventure style), this bag will do well for you as a pillion bag, and with a little strap adjustments, it also fits vertical on the front or back of a sissy-bar, or horizontal on a larger luggage rack... 
I tried to sum it up in the title, this paint is tough, applies easily and covered more calipers than I needed it to. I painted 2 front and 3 rear calipers to a 1981 Trans Am. These are reasonable large calipers, fronts have large pistons and the rear pistons are smaller 2 1/2" to give you an idea of the size. I originally painted all 4 calipers at once, and still had a little bit of paint left in the can that I thought i'd save for touch up. StoneAuto company sent me two drivers side calipers, and I didn't figure it out till I installed them. So I had to use the remainder of the can to paint a 5th caliper, and it did it! Unlike other brands where there's nothing but air when the can gets close to empty,  VHT / Dupli-color impress me every time with their never ending paint cans. And there's still a little more left in the can!I also used the recommendedVHT SP118 Primerfirst, I dusted my calipers with 2 coats of primer then followed it with 2 dusting of the black and one last heavy coat, each coat spaced 10-12 minutes apart. I've maybe used 1/2 the can of primer. I got it quickly it looks good can not wait to use it as soon as I can go out side . GLAD  I  WENT  WITH  THE  CHROME AND  NOT  THE BLACK ONE, I  HOOKED  THIS ONE UP TO  MY GV1400 MOTORCYCLE IF  YOU  HAVE JUST  A  LITTLE  KNOW  HOW YOU CAN  DO  IT YOUR SELF , ALL  YOU WILL NEED TO GO WITH THIS IS A RELAY THAT DOES NOT COME WITH IT. YOU  CAN  GET IT ON HERE OR ANY PART STORE, I  HAVE MADE MANY PEOPLE JUMP  DUE  TO THE SOUND OF  THE  HORNS  LOUDNESS. 
The install is easy, just level your camper using a carpenter level of 3 feet or longer.  Set the level from side-to-side on your smooth flooring or counter top. Then set the level from front-to-back the same way on the smooth flooring or counter top.  Now position the Hopkins 08525 levels, one on the side you prefer to work from at the front of the camper, on a flat vertical surface.  Do the same on a side wall near the front corner on a smooth vertical surface.  Use the double stick tape to position, but consider adding pop rivets or small screws to hold the setting for many years.  Holes are provided in the Hopkins levels.Use the front level first to drive onto leveling ramps or boards, then use the side level along with the tongue jack to finish (after you unhitch). Extend your stabilizer jacks and you're set for level comfortable sleeping in your camper. This product fits like it should and would look really nice if it had been shipped properly!  I got it and the box was all crunched.  The item had no cushioning around it and the front is bent in.  Need to return for a replacement!  It would have been 5 stars if the front had not been bent in and it was packed properly!  Fits right over my 3 burner RV stove and rest on the counter top.  I will be adding rubber feet so that it will scratch the sides of my stove nor my counter top!  To secure it you have to screw it to the counter top.  The back has a hing with 5 screw holes in it where you can secure it or it will stay put without screwing it down.  It came with 5 long screws.  Not sure if i want to secure mine yet.  I have a new RV and not sure i want to put screw holes in the knife holder behind the stove! I bought this because it comes up when searching for a Cadillac Eldorado 1994 but this blade is too curved.  It stands an inch above the window in the middle the whole way across. 
These mirrors fit over the factory mirrors like a glove! They really fit nice, and no vibration. The do an ok job. It depends on the size of the trailer you are towing. They worked well with my 22 foot travel trailer, but now we have a 30 foot travel trailer, and they don't offer as much rear viewing sight. I will have to go to the factory extended mirrors. Which I kinda of expected that. For the money they do well!If you will do a lot of towing, and in busy areas, I would recommend the factory extended mirrors. They cost more, but may be worth the extra, as compared to side swiping someone! I think for as much as they do extend, they could of been a little larger, just my two cents worth. My Mom has a 2007 accord that fairly well has a motorcycle battery 51R.  I got her one of these because she doesn't drive that car much.My wife makes short trips to work and I bought another for myself to top off her battery if the car sets all weekend which it does sometimes.  It doesn't really need it as much since it has a real car battery but it's helpful.  I have a full sized charger and this one is much easier because you can attach the bolt on  accessory to the battery and just pop the hood and plug it in.  You still get the alligator clip accessory to use on others cars while the bolt on accessory is on the first car.  It's a handy tool and I have had no problems with it.Some people say the HF ones are cheaper as about as good.  I don't know, I never had one,  I know this one works. We have used FOUR different towing mirrors on two different trucks in the past year.These actually work...although my wife is bothered by the F-150 inset mirror on the truck itself, having the 3rd mirror is unnerving to her, but these are SO much better than the strap on mirror setup you see on other systems.These do fit on 2013 F-150 trucks (just don't get for the STX -- different mirrors). 
There are two horns, not one. One is 400Hz and the other one is 500Hz.PIAA | Automotive Sports Horn (400/500Hz) #85110The are exact fits on the mounts as the OEM horns and use the same bolts. A 1/4 inch drive ratchet and a 12mm socket is needed to remove and install the bolt. They came with grounding leads with ring spade lugs that mounted readily under the existing M6 bolts on the radiator supports. All you need is a 10mm socket.The two wiring harness leads are too short to connect the horns. Two wire tie mounts hold the harness to the aluminum bumper reinforcement. You can cut off the ties and use the OEM harness to connect the horns, but I chose not to.  I prefer NOT to cut off the OEM connector blocks.I made two pigtail extensions out of 18 gauge black primary wire, 5 inches long. One end needs a 1/4 inch wide exposed male quick disconnect. The other end needs an insulated female 1/4 inch quick disconnect terminal. Since I used 18 gauge wire, I used the red coded ones.The exposed male connector slides into the OEM horn connector perfectly. The female one clips easily onto the positive terminal of each horn.The horns how have a weather shield on the apertures.Best thing to my surprise is that they appear to be very high quality and Made in Japan.Also nice is that they need no modification to the horn relay or circuit. No more "nagging" to close the screen door! You could probably buy a spring at your local hardware store for about the same price, but the pre-determined install tension (distance to drill holes) and where to mount the spring(s) makes it well worth the $7. I followed the instructions for screw hole distance and only needed 1 spring. Both springs may pull the door past the latch at rest (without door swinging closed), but a normal entry/exit the single spring has enough to overcome the latch without slamming the door. The install is easy, just level your camper using a carpenter level of 3 feet or longer.  Set the level from side-to-side on your smooth flooring or counter top. Then set the level from front-to-back the same way on the smooth flooring or counter top.  Now position the Hopkins 08525 levels, one on the side you prefer to work from at the front of the camper, on a flat vertical surface.  Do the same on a side wall near the front corner on a smooth vertical surface.

Fits perfectly for my 2003 Toyota Camry, but the number of folds in the filter were fewer than the OEM one. It's short 10 folds compared to the Toyota OEM cabin air filter. Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlander 
I got a power plug to power plug style &#34;jumper&#34; device for my daughter, in case the 12V battery on her Prius dies.  Since the Prius doesn't use the 12V battery to start the motor, she doesn't need real jumper cables.  However, it's a keyless ignition, so she will not be able to jump power plug to power plug.  The battery on the Prius is has small terminals, so these are a nice size and should do the job of getting power from someone else's light to her battery. **Edit - If you take something away from my post, it is that automakers design cars to run on specific spark plugs. Buy whatever works great for you car, and avoid spark plugs that don't run well. These didn't work in my car, but everyone is different. Check forums to see what works best as well.**I drive a 1998 Honda Civic EX with a VTEC engine. I am currently running NGK V-Power spark plugs and the original factory spark plug wires. I bought these spark plugs to see fuel economy gains and maybe a power increase while merging onto the freeway.They work, but I couldn't tell they were new. MPG's for my car went down to 36, usually 38-40, and so the price didn't match the product well. What I can tell you is that using the right spark plug for your car is key, and trying to eeek out extra MPG's from spark plugs doesn't work so well. I tried Autolites, NGK, etc. iridium plugs and the traditional copper cores work the best. I get 45-50 mpg highway on standard spark plugs.So save your money (I think I spent $16-24 for the set, it's been a while since I returned them) and buy 3-4 sets of copper core NGK V-Power plugs or whatever fits your car.The other thing to note is that replacing severley worn spark plugs with these will net fuel economy gains, but putting any new plugs in will do that. Don't be fooled by these fancy plugs. Shop for your car and check what your car is recommended to use, because that is usually the best option. Your car's computer is programed for the original plugs, not different ones.It's your money, but read the reviews to see if it helps your specific car. It didn't do anything for mine.One plus is that Amazon is amazing with returns. This is the kind of spark plug gapper / gap tool you should use when gapping Iridium spark plugs. Simply wonderful. 
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. 
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. Perfect fit for rear window on my 2004 Ford Excursion Limited. Easy to install. No spotting seen or squeaking at all 
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. Fit my '98 Nissan Frontier's oil pan perfectly. Looks to be of nice quality.  Torque to 25ft/lbs (on the Frontier anyway) This product does not fit your 2012 Toyota Tacoma! That's according to Amazon.YES, IT DOES FIT MY 2012 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab.I don't know what that white powder is on the rubber seal, but I cleaned it before installing the cap.  No error codes and no gas stolen so far. 
Works as advertised. IT WORKS These item does fit perfect on my 2004 BMW x3. does what its suppose to do. so far so good thanks 
It does what it is supposed to do, that is to increase placement distance from the car to the electrical outlet My last same-sized container anti-seize, standing at attention, lasting me 30 years (home use), so my children will finish this one.About it:It's silver in color, 8-oz. container (a bunch), -65F - 1600F, Anti-Seize, -Corrosion and -Galling; has Lid Brush; label indicates "Made in USA".Specific Use: Ease assembly and disassembly of hardware which experience extreme temperatures and/or corrosive conditions.I've used this routinely, and sparingly for it does not take much - just a light swipe on threads, mating surfaces etc.  Most of my last container went to lubricating boat and boat engine components for very good saltwater corrosion prevention.A general caution is: not apply to business end of sparkplug, O2 sensor etc (lightly on threads/sealing surface only) - else could impact component performance (never seen it happen lol).*UPDATE: I visited Permatex website - wished I'd done so earlier ... A summary:From Website Technical Data Sheets (TDS),This Permatex (80078) has ingredients of "aluminum, copper and graphite lubricants ... meets or exceed requirements of Mil Spec Mil-A-907E."Temperature Range: "-51F to 1600F"Flash: ">350F"TDS Applications: "Sparkplug threads, Exhaust & Engine Hardware, Brake Assemblies, Boilers, Ovens, Jet Engines and Turbines.", and does refer to a "Marine" use.Permatex Copper:  This may be a preferred product due to seemingly inherent do-all capability: Dielectric grease, anti-seize, anti-corrosion to include mating surfaces of dissimilar metals.

It does help tone down my state-issued YELLOW plate though, so it serves its purpose somewhat. 
Purchased this as an OE replacement per the factory manual for a Honda powered snow thrower and it works just fine! Red line diff  oil for my 02 C5 Z06!!!other than all diff oils smelling bad, great oil and will put my Z06 to the limit w/o worring about diff. Perfect for exhaust work.  I bought it for a catalytic converter and o2 sensor project because it is rated for: -30F to 1800F 
to those who wish to know the truth regarding PIAA light bulbs.the PIAA light bulbs are no better than stock light bulbs.i purchased my 2004 toyota corolla brand new. the stock lights burned out in the year 2011.do the math, seven years without a stock light burn out.stock lights are just as good or better than the overpriced PIAA light bulbs.PIAA 10926 9006 (HB4) Intense White - 9006 51W=115W Xtra Intense White Bulb, Twin Pack These bulbs work as described. The 4000Ks illuminate clear white for those who want no yellow or blue hues. They are definitely brighter than standard bulbs, but keep in mind nothing will emulate HID brightness. This is a quick and easy upgrade from 55 watt lamps to these much brighter 130 watt bulbs. they are wall made and appear to be of higher quality than the Hella lamps that came with my fog lights. 
I bought these horns to replace the weak sounding horn that Toyota puts in the Corolla, Matrix, Prius, Yaris, ect.. These horns are very load to say the least. The Hella box included one low tone horn and one high tone horn. It also included instructions and a single Bosch style relay.There is NO wiring of any kind included with this purchase (this is why I gave it a 4 star). I made my own wiring harness which included a 30 amp fusible link, and the included relay and a relay socket. The following link is to the picture of my install on my 2006 Toyota Matrix XR:[...]Make sure you use the included relay in your install. I know some people have just used the existing single horn wire (not using relay), but these new horns have a pretty heavy amp draw! The last thing you want to do is mess up your factory wiring because of some horns. Do it the right way, and follow the instructions! Your horns will also sound better.You can not beat the price and sound quality of these horns! They will get your attention, I can promise you that.  I do recommend these horns! After 5 years the rear tail light bulb on my SUV went bad, I picked these up and went to replace them and found out that what my SUV came with from the factory was this exact same bulb.Replacement was a snap (2 screws and I was done).I will be frank.  I'm an avid lover of Amazon and its low prices. These were more expensive here on Amazon but if you want to avoid a trip to the automotive store or you don't have an automotive store these'll come to your door although the automotive store has the database that tells you what vehicle it fits (would be great if amazon had a similar database - hint hint).Bear in mind, these bulbs fit dozens of vehicles but you need to know the part number that you need before you order.  Also, installation difficulty also varies by vehicle.  I'm handy around vehicles and have tools so it was a pinch for me, but if you're not mechanically inclined you might just want to opt for having these replaced at a dealer.It's a five dollar job if you know what you're doing.LED CHOICES:A few things on LED lights out there.  LED lights have come a long way but by and large its hard to find an LED light that does the job these bulbs do although LEDs should last forever.  The other thing about LEDs is that they draw very little power and that can cause some problems in your vehicle.  Example, the way I knew my brake light (blinker light) was broken was that when I turned on the blinker it flashed really fast (flash flash flash flash vs flash pause flash pause flash pause)...because LEDs draw so little power, your car thinks you have a broken flash light so your blinkers could flash fast (alerting you that your blinker light is out)...some of the newer LED lights have a capacitor built in to prevent his behavior but bottom line, its hard to tell what you're getting.  I'll tell you, as soon as I find an LED light that is as bright as these bulbs, doesn't have the issues of fast flashing, and has bright lights - I will most definitely buy them primarily because LEDs should last longer than my car.  The other thing about LEDs is that they're expensive.  Bottom line, if you know what you're doing LEDs are a good option if you go find the right ones.  If you don't know your way around these newest products, go with these regular bulbsPREMIUM BULBS:In my experience they're a waste of money unless you're a car afficionado and are going for a particular look.BRIGHTNESS OF THESE BULBS:Since they were the exact same bulb that came with my car from the factory, the look is exactly the same.  Exactly the same light intensity - no more or less.  Fine by me, it's legal and bright enough.LONGEVITY OF THIS BULB:It took the set that came from the factory 5 years to burn out.  Since they're these same bulbs, I expect another 5 years from these. This item was purchased because my landscape trailer was constantly pulling my harnesses apart, they would drag the street all the time. This is a simple bracket you install on your hitch or bumper that keeps the light harness stationary. I will never again go without this bracket. matter of fact I plan to order a few more so I have them when I upgrade or buy more trucks for my company. I highly recommend this product if you pull any kind of trailer. 
These covers are very good. They are not very fancy and don't come n velvet, but they are very durable, good for the price, don't slip, and simply do the job! These fit perfectly and are easy to use and keep your connector clean and dry when not in use.  Great buy. They work great and look great.  The directions are to the point and they are easily installed.  The materials used are strong and stand up to the everyday use. 
these seem to be very good quality spreaders. I am going to buy another set to have on hand  in case i need them. I agree that these should come on the Jeep instead of having to pay extra for them, but with that said, installation was easy and they look good.  Overall I'd buy them again. I have the Hi-Lift jack and felt that this item would be great for an insurance policy if something happened to the jack and I needed to make an emergency repair.  In fact, I purchased two of them just in case, and maybe help out someone without the kit.  I highly recommend, and they will last as long as the jack does if you never need them. 
Yes, these are wheel chocks.  They're not fancy, but they will hold a round piece of rubber just fine. The price is very good for these handles - other handles are extremely over priced.However after placing them on my two door jeep i bump my head on them when exiting.They are really thick and it's hard to get hand around them since they are very close to the bar.THey are ok for the price - would recommend others for more comfortable and rigid look. Evidently these are meant for use on cars ONLY. They are too small to fit the coil springs on my '11 Silverado. Otherwise I guess they are decent spring compressors. 
Pros: battery driven; flashing or steady light; flameless flare; can be used as a map light; reusable. Could be used effectively as a light that does not seriously degrade night vision.Cons: Product claims to be visible at 1000 ft, but this is only possible within a few degrees of view. One half of the top lights up for a dim presentation, but the bright LED shines out through a narrow beam like a small red flashlight. Consequently, the flare would probably not be useful in a traffic situation since it would have to be precisely aligned with oncoming traffic and would only be visible by the few drivers within this narrow beam of light. It is certainly not a good substitute for a real flare which is much brighter and omnidirectional. This little light is not as good as the emergency flashers built into vehicles.If you want a safety flare to carry in your vehicle, buy the real thing. If you want a light you can use as a map light without distracting a driver, or to see where you're walking without seriously degrading your night vision, this red light will do that well. I installed these on my 2005 GMC Envoy XL with brush guard and they work and look great. They really light up the offroad trails and remote roads at night. I used to have the very large Hella offroad lights and these are just as bright.Installation is no more or less difficult than other lights. There's no magic here - you have to run 12V and ground to the lights, the relay, to the battery, etc. I replaced my stock H4 bulb in my 1983 Honda Goldwing with this bulb. It is a nice light that seems to light up the road better. I have Silverstar lamps in all my cars too. 
Bought this to use withValterra F02-4100 45 RV Hydroflushso I could wash out my tanks.Here is my review of that setuphttp://www.amazon.com/Valterra-F02-4100-45%C2%B0-RV-Hydroflush/product-reviews/B0002UHVAA/ref=cm_cr_dp_synop?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints;=0&sortBy;=bySubmissionDateDescending#R2CUAU2B8XC98QIt works great.I also like that I have this as an emergency backup if one of my valves ever fails. You can't say much about this quick disconnect plug. But one for sure: having it installedcharging your motorcycle is much easier than using those old fashioned alligator clamps.If you also interested in buying a battery maintainer the harness is included in this one:&#34;Black & Decker BM3B 6V and 12V Battery Charger / Maintainer&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051D3MP6/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0You may also like to hear that there is a adapter available from SAE-2-USB plug available:&#34;SAE to USB Adapter - Motorcycle Cell Phone Charger&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007VFFQRE/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1So if you also use a navigation system while riding you can easily charge this on the road. A nice charger. Is also smaller than it appears on the picture. So easy to carry and handle.Unfortunately I had to send it back because it just has the standard clamps to charge.There were no &#34;Quick Disconnect Extension&#34; option to easy plug-n-charge a motorcycle.So I bought the &#34;Black & Decker BM3B 6V and 12V Battery Charger / Maintainer&#34;:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051D3MP6/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0 
I replaced my stock H4 bulb in my 1983 Honda Goldwing with this bulb. It is a nice light that seems to light up the road better. I have Silverstar lamps in all my cars too. This is a quick and easy upgrade from 55 watt lamps to these much brighter 130 watt bulbs. they are wall made and appear to be of higher quality than the Hella lamps that came with my fog lights. to those who wish to know the truth regarding PIAA light bulbs.the PIAA light bulbs are no better than stock light bulbs.i purchased my 2004 toyota corolla brand new. the stock lights burned out in the year 2011.do the math, seven years without a stock light burn out.stock lights are just as good or better than the overpriced PIAA light bulbs.PIAA 10926 9006 (HB4) Intense White - 9006 51W=115W Xtra Intense White Bulb, Twin Pack 
This four station battery tender is just as simple to use as the single units.  One simply plugs the unit in and connects the battery via alligator clips or a connection affixed to the battery. Its a simple task to tell what state the battery is in.  If amber the battery is deep charging, if green range it is 80 to 100% charged.  After the battery is charged, leaving in connected will put the unit in float mode, which will keep the battery "topped off" without damaging it.  My only concern is the housing is plastic and all of my single units are metal.  It does have mounting holes so it can be wall mounted or affixed more securely to a shelf, etc.  Like the single units, total time from opening the box to charging is about 2 minutes.By the way, instructions for deciphering the state of the amber and green lights are not in the instruction manual but on the right side of the unit.I also ordered the 12 foot extension cables, a good call if you need to have your batteries more than about four feet from the unit. First of all, the unit shows you voltage with a total of 4 digits.Second, once the car is started, you get a circluing arrow in the left top corner of the display, indicating that a charge is occurring. However, this is a static icon, it does not rotate as at least I would have except.You also get a bar on the right side of the display showing the battery charge level and a 3-light indication at the bottom. And in case you should forget I guess, they even added a little battery icon in the display.However, I seriously question the accuracy of these units (this is the second one).When plugged in (my van has multiple outlets, I check on 4 of them), the unit shows 11.4 Volts and a red light. Wow, never had an issue with my battery nor charging system. Started the car (which it did fine), unit showed 14.8 Volts. Really!I went to the shop and had everything checked. My high-output alternator (120 amps) was working above manufacturer's specs; my 1000 cold cranking amp battery is in excellent condition.I exchange the unit, the replacement showed the same odd numbers. Now, the manual you can download from Equus (wich does not come with the unit) states issues like that there could be dirty battery terminals etc. etc. I had the shop check the voltage on my cigarette lighter which a regular voltmeter and it showed completely different numbers.We even hooked up the car charger which went into float charging (meaning battery is full) within 2 minutes.The only reason to have this monitor would be to, well, monitor your battery. For this you need accurate readings, and I can not see these on this unit. I ordered 2 different chargers to maintain my gate opener's deep cycle battery (a simple 4 output charger with extension cords for charging other deep cycle batteries from amazonBattery Tender 022-0148-DL-WH 12V 4-Bank Battery Management System) and this unit has a far superior charging design.The 4 bank battery tender does a simple fast rate charge then switches to a trickle charge at a constant voltage with 4 outputs.This unit pulses the battery under charge and features 3 operating modes with different current outputs for different sized batteries. The selections are motorcycle which also works well for SLA gel cells or AGM batteries, standard automotive starting battery, deep cycle batttery, and off.What makes the CTEK unit special is that it uses a pulse charge in all modes to attempt to desulphate batteries, while the battery tender does not.  This method of charging has proven successful in restoring lead acid batteries that won't take a charge any more.It comes with a waterproof 12V output cable and a set of clips or rings for permanent installation under the hood of your car.  In addition to the LEDs for indicating the type of battery being charged, a second set is provided for empty, 1/2 full, and maintenance pulse charge mode.There is also a noticable increase in quality between the battery tender and this unit - small details like a water sealed housing and gaskets on the connectors indicate quality in manufacture.For a single 12V lead chemistry battery this is a useful, well made tool. 
I bought these horns to replace my rusted out horns on my camaro.  Note that you need the high and low as they work in unison.  It took me about 15 min to replace them and these work as good as new. You'll have to splice in to your existing wiring ( I just used some 3m quick connects to splice in ) and I reused the stock locations and bolts.  These horns come with brackets as well. i thought i need one for towing but my factory installed adapter is still working so i just have to keep this for future use. I've seen the reviews questioning the capacity of this cord, so I'm wondering if maybe there are changes in the cord.  The one I received is marked on the back of the package:"18 gauge wire""15 Amp Capacity"Now, I'm not an electrician, nor do I pretend to be one.  I don't know that 18G wire is sufficient to carry 15A.  I'll be using this for a small GPS that I mounted up high and I don't want the cord in the windshield. 
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. Exact replacement from OEM. Exact fit worked perfect . Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs. Great Fit 
They say 4100k, color temperature matches my stock 2700k bulbs (appearance in housing and beam). I returned right away. The life is rated poorly too. Not woth the money for fog lights. I purchased quality LED bulbs cheaper that will last as long as I own my car. Valterra is known for quality RV products and accessories, this is no exception. Shipping was on time and product was exactly what I was expecting. If you are looking to upgrade from sealed beam headlights to replaceable bulb halogen types, this is the way to go. Far more light is transferred to the road and ahead than before and with the same wattage bulbs. 
Works as intended, easy to plug in and charge the motorcycle batteries.I double checked with volt meter at the end of charging and was at proper voltage Nice high amp (current) rating on this. I epoxy it to a 12ah  12 volt gel battery and I can use it as a jumpstarter oremergency power supply for camping or power outages. After a power outage, I connected my refrigerator to this power supply. Sadly, its inverter was unable to support my refrigerator. The Duracell DPP-600HD doesn't have enough momentary  output to handle the initial start-up current spike of a refrigerator's compressor motor. The specifications say it can momentarily provide up to 960 watts. This equates to 8 amps at 120v.  Yet, public benchmark figures for a home refrigerator's start-up current indicate 13 amps for up to 1/2 second. Other appliances that use electric motors such as sump pumps are likely to exhibit the same characteristics. My suggestion is that customers immediately test this product with any device they intend to power during an outage.Some important specifications are missing in the Amazon listing.  One of the key statics is the capacity of the internal battery, which is 28 amp-hours at 12 v.  This equates to 336 watt hours.  Yet, AC output is much lower than this presumably due to inverter losses.  These losses increase with power output.  The following table illustrates this.  The last column is my calculation.load.................watts....hours....watt-hoursCordless telephone.....5........35.0 ...175Portable stereo.........10........22.0 ...220Laptop computer.......20........7.0 ....140Fan.......................100.........1.7....17036" TV...................133........1.2 ....1603/8 drill.................300........0.4 ....115Warm-air fan heater.312........0.4 ....109Blender..................385........0.3 ....109HID Floodlights.......400........0.3.....107Observe that the total energy delivered (watt-hour) drops with power consumption.  Ultimately, the usable energy is significantly less than what is contained within the lead acid battery.For reference, a refrigerator will use about 200 watts of electricity when the compressor is running. Typical consumers will have their refrigerator running about 50% to 60% of the time, which equates to an average of 100-120 watts being consumed continuously.ConsDoesn't handle current spikes associated with certain electric motorsProsBoth AC and DC outputPortableSimple operation 
The Tender Jr. does not come with a cigarette adapter so I cut this in half to make two. I purchased 2 lighter plugs for a buck each from China&#8230; with free shipping&#8230; and they are working fine. These aren&#8217;t an exact match with the Tender cables but they fit together OK and are easy to determine polarity with the wire colors. You can also just use this as an extension cord for your Tender. The description states a length of 12-inches&#8230; but it&#8217;s actually 14-inches tip-to-tip on the connectors. Nice item for the price and it&#8217;s made in Mexico. I use these in the home garage and am not a master mechanic.  This feeler gauge set is great buy.  The feelers are clearly laser marked in both in and mm.  There is a great variety to create any thickness you want to gauge.  They easily come apart to create a gauge or rearrange your most used to the top.  These were the same OEM brand offered at my local Autozone for half the price. I did not carefully read reviews before placed my order.  Few buyer pointed out the product feature has changed.  According ad photo, It suppose has green and red indicator lights but only comes with one single red light, green light feature is omitted.  Red light means AC power is on but no way to tell it is actually charging or not?  For only one red light version, you can pay less than half price from other seller for similar product at Amazon. 
It is clear and the flip thing works fine.  It fit my stock mount on my windshield perfectly.  It does come with a mount for you to use, just no glue.  But, as I said, it fit my old one with no problems at all. used it on my 1994 f150 2wd for the rear end cover. Sealed it without any issues! Did not seem to work well when i tried to use it on the plastic center cap though This fits in the windshield absolutely perfectly.  It is *exactly* the same size as the windshield opening, so it sits flush against the glass and stays on without using the visors to hold it.  Rolls up and has a velcro strap to keep it closed.  Very effective in the AZ summer. 
I put these in my '03 TJ Jeep Wrangler.  They fit perfect and work exactly as you'd expect they should.  I installed a set of 55w HIDs in them and the light output is tremendous. Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. These worked for my 2005 jeep grand cherokee.  I like how these bulbs will replace any of the three rear lights. 
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. Great Fit Exact replacement from OEM. Exact fit worked perfect . Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs. 
It a belt... it fits, it hold and it rotates. There is no noise coming from it.Happy with the fit and performance. Great Fit good bungies, nice compact cover can litteraly fit in from fork pouch, thin but protective and fit a Dyna Glide without windshield very well

Ok so I figured I would write a review since these seem to be new to amazon and they had prime shipping so I went for them.Firstly these are ATO fuses.  The description doesn't say it anywhere for some odd reason however they also sell a mini fuse set which is labeled correctly and the picture shows ATO fuses.  Anyways, the fuses came in a box that is actually pretty nice and latches properly shut.  Label says 1 year warranty although their fuses so shouldn't have a problem.  On the other side of the boxes label is a chart showing Tan = 5amp, Red = 10amp, Blue = 15amp, Yellow = 20amp, Clear = 25amp, Green = 30amp.The fuses themselves seem to be very nice quality and have the number on them printed clearly however it is the plastic color and not painted white.  Note that the link that connects the two ends is horse shoe shaped rather than zigzagged which is something I personally have never seen before.At ~$10 it was a great price for 120 fuses + an actual working container. I bought 6 of these for my 2005 BMW 325i sedan.Although they don't have BMW parts numbers/logos, I believe these are almost the same as OEM marked spark plug.Installed and works fine. These do not have the stackable banana plugs as pictured from Amazon.com.  You need to view the customer's pictures to see how these look.The build quality is cheap.  The quality of the wires itself is not as flexible as DMM test leads.  I use these on a bench power supply.  I will never use these on a DMM.If you plan on using these on a DMM, I would highly recommend you buy some Fluke test leads. 
I bought this for my 97 f150 and was very surprised at the cheap price for a quality price. very impressed! This is an OEM product for many Japanese vehicles.  Great price.  As a dealer, I can buy at a good price from the auto supply, this is a better price. My coworker recommended this brand and I'm glad I got them. They work great and are definitely work not paying outlandish dealer and shop prices for replacement. 
These lights will be the main lighting in my Teardrop Camper Trailer when I get back to work on it next spring. They look like good quality lights and the switch works perfectly on them. I connected one of them to 12v and they are nice and bright. The diffusers are great and do a good job of diffusing the light with no lines or shadows. These lights are very light weight, but that is not a concern as I am building my Teardrop as light as possible.If you are after LED lighting, these are also a good choice because you can easily upgrade the bulb to an LED Retrofit from most any Automotive supply store, Amazon, or Ebay. They have the direct replacement LEDs for RVs for most any fixture.You won't go wrong with these lights. I put these in my '03 TJ Jeep Wrangler.  They fit perfect and work exactly as you'd expect they should.  I installed a set of 55w HIDs in them and the light output is tremendous. Fits a little tight especially around the front fender and floorboards but it works.  I have a 03' Shadow ACE 750cc.  After a couple rain storms I can report my bike stayed dry (except a portion of the front wheel) and through heavy winds, the motorcycle cover stayed put.  What&#8217;s nice about this cover is the price and how it has elastic hooks to secure the cover in place.  If you decide to buy a cover and your bike has a windshield, floor boards and aftermarket mirrors I recommend you buy a 2XL (if your bike is similar in size to a Shadow 750cc).  Look at the picture I posted, mine has stock mirrors and no windshield and fits VERY tight.  My mirrors shift out of place when the cover is on.  Before each ride I have to adjust them cause the cover is soo tight.  Also, if you have floor boards that&#8217;ll make the fit even more tighter.  Buying one size bigger and I would say you bike will be 100% covered. 
This works great. It's sturdy and fit's nice and snug in a standard 5 gallon bucket. I will be ordering more of these in the future. It fits perfectly to my 2005 Honda Accord.Filter quality seems to be good. Though Amazon stated this cap would not fit my 2013 Ford E-450 chassis (for a Jayco, Class C, Greyhawk, RV), I ordered it anyway as it fits many other years of Ford trucks and looks the same. It is rare for the same vehcle to change a design like that. It, in fact, fits perfectly. Our RV gas filler has no cover (not that that is a deterrant) and 60 gallons is a target for remote theft of gas, or a target for vandalism. This cap fits well. I have not been able to fit the stock cap-retainer onto it yet. I understand these modern vehicles have anti siphon plugs but one can still end up with foreign substances in the exposed fill-tube. This is a good 'ounce of prevention'.Highly recommended. 
Simple install, 2-wire hookup. Works as advertised. It can be installed at 2 different angles, gives an option for mounting. My unit did not come with any instructions.  The tool seems too complicated to be very useful, but does work. The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around! 
No problems with the great products but watch the packaging done by Amazon on this one. All of this came individual in a large box not in a Meguiar's kit box. I had to make sure that everything in the picture is what I actually got and it is. Right part number and looks good.  Clean package box although the tube ends did not have the caps like Fram, but will take Motorcraft any day. These are great, but they didn't come with a bag.  TheTri-Lynx 00015 Lynx Leveler for RV Leveling Block with Nylon Storage Case, (Pack of 10)comes with a very nice bag that would actually work well for these wheel chocks.  It would be nice if they had included that or another bag for these (that would have earned the product 5 stars). 
These are ok. They keep the water from reaching the floor, but without ridges - they also keep the water to where it hits your shoes. In and out of the car in snowy and icy conditions and you can be damn sure that you are going to end up getting freezing water in your shoes as an unpleasant surprise. They are hard to empty without spilling because of the lack of a lip on the front of the liner. So, you either wait till the water drys on its own - which doesn't happen in winter, soak it up with a towel, or attempt to empty it and end up with water exactly where it wasn't supposed to go. However they probably work fine for sandy or muddy conditions, as they are pretty easy to clean off. Overall, there are better options and I wish I had gone with one of the other options instead. I haven't had a chance to use them in the rain but for normal riding they are very good.  Easy to put on with the two zippers and they seem to have a complete liner that is waterproof.  Comfortable too.  They are not SIDI or BMW quality but for the price are fine.This was added after a 4 hour ride in the rain.  This boot is a rain magnet, I had so much water in these it could be dumped out.  I need to change these to NO STARS as the main point of buying a waterproof boot is to have it be water-proof and these are NOT.  Don't buy these if you want any sort of water resistance or water proofing as they are bad for that. I tried these wipers recently and can say that they do a good job. They get a solid 3 star rating.The wipers do in fact clean your windshield and do a good job and removing water, debris, etc that is on your windshield. The wipers do install pretty easy. What these wipers don't do is impress me. The price point is good, at $13 a piece you are looking at a cost of around $26 to get wipers for your car. Not bad.But I also have tried a number of Bosch blades and prefer theBosch 4841 Evolution All-Season Bracketless Wiper Blade, 22" (Pack of 1)to these. Those don't totally impress me either, but I notice that they do a better job at removing more water and being streak free. For example, if you drive through a car wash and at the exit flip on your wipers to shake off the last bit of water both blades will in fact clean the water off. But I found the Anco left some small streaks and drops of water behind where the Bosch left a nearly dry surface.You really can't go wrong with these wipers, is it worth an extra dollar to go with Bosch? Probably not. In the rain a little tiny streak won't be evident, in sunny weather that excess water will evaporate quickly, it's really a tiny amount. If you need wipers get these and try them out, they do in fact work, I'm just not giving it more then 3 stars because I am not "wowed" by these. 
These mirrors are the best that I have found for towing a travel trailer.  They are easily installed and they do not vibrate at all.  The field of view is goodsnd When not towing a trailer, they are easily removed for storage. I bought two of these one for mysely and the other for my son inlaw. Both will be used for a flag pole mount on the back of his truck an the other on my motorhome. Put threaded rod through the ball mount hole ant PVC pipe on the threaded rod .It works out great.Cant beat the price for this mount and PVC is cheap. The rubber is soft so my vehicle doors are protected from hitting the concrete wall. I used doubled sided adhesive tape and it holds it nice and tight. Great product! 
These horns are just the ticket in replacing stock inferior horns. These are a much nicer sounding horn than the loud blast of an air horn. Perfect horns to boost the warning ability of your vehicle without sounding like a Big Rig. Evidently these are meant for use on cars ONLY. They are too small to fit the coil springs on my '11 Silverado. Otherwise I guess they are decent spring compressors. These are a good accessory to have because the clips are decent quality and the varied colors are helpful in keeping track of all the wires. 
Loud and i know what i am saying, i always liked loud horns and i did have one until this came and it was louddd, i have since upgraded to an air tank horn but these are loud believe me this is definitely not 130 DB, it really is tuned well and sounds sweet but not close to being a freeway blaster, i would say its about the same volume as the two HS horns that i took out, i replaced them thinking they were shot but it turned out to be the relay was bad, but i must reiterate, they sound clean and well tuned. but i am giving it 4 stars for not being loud I admittedly didn't see the sound byte of the horn until now, and if I had heard it earlier, I would have thought differently. I installed this to have a lower, and hopefully louder tone in my horn. The factory horn was lower though. I realize this is probably more for motorcycles now, so on an Isuzu Trooper, it is a little pathetic. I blame this on myself though, and I realize the product is good for its intended audience. Just don't buy this if you havea  truck! The look of this horn, if you have it visible, is a plus, and the shipping and installation were a breeze. 
I bought these horns to replace the weak sounding horn that Toyota puts in the Corolla, Matrix, Prius, Yaris, ect.. These horns are very load to say the least. The Hella box included one low tone horn and one high tone horn. It also included instructions and a single Bosch style relay.There is NO wiring of any kind included with this purchase (this is why I gave it a 4 star). I made my own wiring harness which included a 30 amp fusible link, and the included relay and a relay socket. The following link is to the picture of my install on my 2006 Toyota Matrix XR:[...]Make sure you use the included relay in your install. I know some people have just used the existing single horn wire (not using relay), but these new horns have a pretty heavy amp draw! The last thing you want to do is mess up your factory wiring because of some horns. Do it the right way, and follow the instructions! Your horns will also sound better.You can not beat the price and sound quality of these horns! They will get your attention, I can promise you that.  I do recommend these horns! The Tender Jr. does not come with a cigarette adapter so I cut this in half to make two. I purchased 2 lighter plugs for a buck each from China&#8230; with free shipping&#8230; and they are working fine. These aren&#8217;t an exact match with the Tender cables but they fit together OK and are easy to determine polarity with the wire colors. You can also just use this as an extension cord for your Tender. The description states a length of 12-inches&#8230; but it&#8217;s actually 14-inches tip-to-tip on the connectors. Nice item for the price and it&#8217;s made in Mexico. I bought some really bad fuse holders that had some horrible fuses included. I had to replace the fuses with the ones from this ATD. These fuses are great quality and they include all the common fuse sizes which is great. This is a sweet buy when you consider your local auto parts store asks $3-$5 for just a pack of 3 fuses in one size. You get alot of fuses in the most common amperage's. Please note these are just one size fuse, There is still one size larger blade fuse and two smaller sizes. Check what you have before ordering. Personally I got them for my fuse-able links I'm adding for all the accessories I have added to my vehicle. When you do any accessory installs in your vehicle I recommend fusing at the point you tapped power from. Better safe than sorry. 
My nozzles were old and kinda blocked .. those ones are soo sweet with nice and even spray pattern ..  perfect upgrade for the right price. These are not your cheap run of the mill clips. They are very thick and durable; solder joints on clips are good too. This product is definitely well made. Evidently these are meant for use on cars ONLY. They are too small to fit the coil springs on my '11 Silverado. Otherwise I guess they are decent spring compressors. 
One month update:I am still very pleased with the horns, and increased my rating from 4 to 5.  I originally gave the horns a 4 rating because they weren't as loud as I was expecting, but now think they are just perfect just as they are.Original review:I replaced the wimpy original horn on my 2001 Sebring Coupe LXi with this pair of horns as part of a bigger make over.  It took about 20 minutes with great results.  Not as loud as I would have liked, but much better sound more likely to get attention when needed.  I was mystified that some of the reviewers apparently only installed one or the other of the horns.  They are meant to be installed as a pair (even if you only have one horn as original equipment).  If you do have only one horn its a simple matter to re-wire for two horns.  The package includes simple easy to follow wiring diagrams and a pair of ground wires (one for each horn).  In my case I had one power wire to one horn, so I joined two wires together at the male end (to plug into the power lead) and two separate female ends to plug into the horns.  Same arrangement for the ground except the joined end is attached to the frame of the car for a ground.  I installed both horns side by side on the tab the original horn was attached to.  Not too hard and sounds pretty good. The horns were easy to install. They draw about the same amount of current as my stock horns (in the 2.5A to 3A range for each PIAA horn), so I was able to use the stock wiring, relay, and fuse instead of having to wire a separate connection to the battery positive. I used Installation Type B (two horns, each with a single wire). The stock horn positive connections plugged directly into the positive quick connect of the PIAA horns. I didn't have to cut off the stock connectors and crimp on new connectors. The stock horns use a single connection, so I ran a separate ground wire from each PIAA horn to a ground point near the hood latch.I made an inverted T bracket to hang the two horns off of the location for one of the stock horns. The PIAA horns are a bit larger than a typical stock "beep-beep" style Japanese horn, so you do have to plan ahead to make sure that you have enough room for the horns and whatever mounting bracket you may use. I angled my PIAA horns slightly outward (instead of hanging straight down) to clear an engine brace below the horns.The horns have a nice Euro sound and are suitably loud. Very good and loud,I replaced my original horn on my Yamaha V-Star 650 Classic with this horn,used same bracket and just plugged it into factory horn wires.Now it sounds more like a truck instead of a VW bug.People notice this horn!Great price too. 
Needed a new set of plug wires for my truck and wanted OEM parts, was able to get these for a fraction of the price from what GM wanted or even some parts stores that carry them. The cheapest place in town to get this is AutoZone and they want $39.99 for it.  At $25, free shipping and no tax, this is a smoking hot deal.  Just a note, I'm putting this on mowers and ATVs.  The cost of a replacement battery is about $40 for a mower and as much as $100 for the ATVs.  So this is a no brainer here.It plugs directly into the wall and comes with about a 6' cord, a permanent battery connection and a second connection with big alligator clips.  So you can put the permanent part on one piece of equipment and use the alligator clips on something else if need be. needed to order one smaller item to get free shipping, and have a motorcycle that will need an oil change soon, so it fit both needs 
If you want to get the most out of your towing lights harness or you truck harness you need these covers...I will never again go without this product...fit tight doesn't fall off with road vibration...Buy, Buy, Buy... I purchased 1 of these to tow my 16 ft camper from Northern New England to Florida this past Spring. You can buy 2 of them and use them for extra protection. I didn't need to do more than 1 as my camper is about 1600 lbs...It took me some driving and stopping to ask others why I didn't feel my sway bar was working to understand I was using it wrong.I had the sway bar to tight. The handle is very easy to turn and you can feel when it gets taunt. Over tightening it will defeat the purpose of using this item. It is NOT a stabilizer bar..it's a sway bar.. took me a while to get it...I prefer to have the sway bar for my small camper..plus it's easy to remove or even loosen..which you really have to do to turn around in tight spaces. The thing will screech as you turn! The sway bar is sup to allow your camper to do some sway just not very much sway. if you over tighten it, it will not work properly..when the wind hits you, both the camper and the car will feel the pull back and forth.. you don't want that.. you want the camper to be able to have some sway with the wind. This product is great because you can adjust the amount of tension for low winds/high winds. GREAT PRODUCT! So these aren't the best cables you can buy.  For that you'll have to go to an electrical or welding supply company and you will PAY!  Probably between 3 and 5 times what these cost!  So unless you plan to start a towing service and need cables that will see daily use, I'd say these are gonna work for you.(Update: After compairing them to the 4ga cables I bought a month or so back for my car, they don't really seem that much thicker...  That's said they are MUCH heavier!  The individual stranding is of a thicker gauge than the other model so I'm guessing that's why the thickness isn't much more...)What I like:--Length - I bought these for a half-ton pickup.  Why?  Because it never fails that your battery will fail to start your engine when your parked in a packed lot with cars on all sides.  Rather than pushing a 3 ton vehicle out you pull the booster vehicle in as close as you can and let the length work for you.--Heft - these cables are no joke.  It's a workhorse grade cable that lets plenty of energy flow.  When trying to start a 5.7L V8, that's kinda important.--Solid Clamps - Unlike some of the other reviews, I don't have a problem opening my parrot clamps with one hand.  But their hardly weak, they'll clamp solid and stay put!(Update: If you really need 2ga booster cables and your skeptical of these, Deka makes a set of 2ga cables for around $150.  I have no personal experence with them but I have a little with the Deka name and they seem pretty good.)What I don't like:--Stiffness - They're not as flexible as I was hoping.  But about as flexible as I expected.  True welding cable in 2ga is about $3 per foot and per cable.  That's why the best jumper cables cost $200+.  Still I was hoping for a little thinner stranding to promote flexibilty.--Cable to Clamp - Like other reviews have mentioned the cable doesn't go all the way to a copper contact connected to the jaws.  Instead.  It's screwed to the body of the clamp then the copper jaws are also screwed to the body.  Still fine I'm sure.So why buy these cables aren't they overkill?  I've had this argument with people before: "My 6ga cheapies start my truck fine."  Well I will attempt to addess this.  As the number in terms of gauge decreases the ammount of conductor increases.  In other words 2ga has more (perhaps 50-100% more) conductor than 4ga.  This doesn't automatically equate to twice as much power but it does certainly allow more power to flow safely.  For those that aren't aware (and I'm not an electrical engineer here), resistance is the enemy of all electrical circuts.  Resistance translates to heat in the same way that friction does when two physical surfaces rub together.  Five basic factors contribute to resistance in a give curcuit and determine the appropriate line size.  Ambient temperature, conductor, line distance, voltage, and amperage.  Ambient temp we have no control over.  Hot is bad so just assume the worst.  This means bigger cable to overcome the additon resistance heat is producing.  Conductor of these is copper so that's good.  You want pure or at least a high purity mix of copper in this type of conductor.  Distance and voltage.  One of these cable's strengths also happens to be a weakness.  Total run length for this circut is 50'.  Pretty long for a low voltage system like 12VDC.  The higher the voltage, the longer it can run on a given gauge wire without encountering too much voltage drop.  12VDC drops voltage on a circuit in a realatively short distance.  So heaiver gauge lines are needed to prevent this.  Amperage is also a big consideration.  The more amps a load pulls the more resistance the circut will generate.  Basically on a small wire, a large load will generate a lot of heat and one of two things will happen. 1) the wire will melt and/or catch on fire.  2) The load your trying to power won't work.  And make no mistake, starting even a small engine takes a LOT of energy!  So bringing it all together.  Large load, low voltage (that we don't want to make in lower), and a long distance run means that you wan the heaviest cables you can find.  Addressing the orignal question and statment.  6' 6ga cables might start your small-block fine.  But if you want or need the extra length, you need to consider heavy gauge cables.  That said I've personally seen light duty cables melt and smoke from starting an engine too big for them.Are these right for you?  So these will run you close to $100 shipped...do you actaully need them?  I own both these and the Coleman 4ga 25' booster cables.  Having no offical training and with no real sizing charts on the packaging I would say this.  The 4ga will do you fine at the 25' length for engines up to 5-liters or so (and honestly probably up to about 6L as well.)  Anything bigger than that and you should be considering these or something even better.Also protect your investment.  Buy a cable bag for them to keep them neat and protected.  Also keep the twist ties that came with them to keep them organized inside your bag.  I have the Arsenal #5888 cable organizer and it works great for this.  Remember too to clean and inspect your cables after each use to prolong their life and keep you safe. 
These lights will be the main lighting in my Teardrop Camper Trailer when I get back to work on it next spring. They look like good quality lights and the switch works perfectly on them. I connected one of them to 12v and they are nice and bright. The diffusers are great and do a good job of diffusing the light with no lines or shadows. These lights are very light weight, but that is not a concern as I am building my Teardrop as light as possible.If you are after LED lighting, these are also a good choice because you can easily upgrade the bulb to an LED Retrofit from most any Automotive supply store, Amazon, or Ebay. They have the direct replacement LEDs for RVs for most any fixture.You won't go wrong with these lights. I installed these on my 2005 GMC Envoy XL with brush guard and they work and look great. They really light up the offroad trails and remote roads at night. I used to have the very large Hella offroad lights and these are just as bright.Installation is no more or less difficult than other lights. There's no magic here - you have to run 12V and ground to the lights, the relay, to the battery, etc. These are light duty jumpers but will work for occasional use. There are times when the voltmeter needs to be connected and you cannot hold the leads. These are fine for that. 
This connector fit my CRV perfectly and made the wiring ofr a new hitch receiver a snap. I am pleased that Honda had the plugs already attached to the harness and that Curt used that setup to make this easy for me. Love this thing - the LED's are a simple verification and the device seems to fit snug and secure in the socket I bought this belt for my 2003 Chevy Tahoe with the 5.3L engine and 145A Alternator. Make sure you know which alternator you have BEFORE purchasing this belt. The 105A alternators use a slightly shorter belt. It fits perfectly, doesn't make any noise and works great! You will also need the smallerGoodyear 4040377 Gatorback Poly V-Beltfor the A/C system on these vehicles.My 145 Amp Alternator has a 145A stamped on the side, visible from the drivers side. You could also look for the old belt part number on the existing belt and order accordingly. 
I just installed this on a Buick Terazza with a Kenwood DNX5120. It works really well.Install was not especially difficult but does entails a bit more than many may be comfortable with.  Fortunately, the vehicle specific instructions on the PAC website are a big help (albeit not idiot proof so look at them before you order).The unit looks a little intimidating at first until you realize that you will not use most of the attached wires.  However, at least on the Buick, you will have to tap into the wiring harness for some of the ones you do use. One step that threw me, until after a few attempts and re-reading the instructions, is that I also needed to run a seperate (not provided) splice of wire to send switched power to another pin on the Buick's harness.  Not difficult, it just took several reads before I realized I even needed to do this.The programming of the unit is pretty straightforward once you get the hang of it.  Again, not difficult, but not 100% intuitive the first time around.If you are have installed electronics before and are not afraid of tapping a wire, counting pins in the harness, etc. this will save you a nice bit of change versus the local audio shop.  If you are a competent backyard mechanic just take your time and you will get it.  If you are unsure, either have it installed or pay a bit more to get it from Crutchfield where a tech can probably walk you through and difficulties.Once installed it works really well, I see no lag at all on any of the buttons.  It is certainly nice to be able to keep your steering wheel controls when going with an aftermarket stereo.  The product itslef gets 5 stars, the install instructions and process bring it down to 4. This is the best brake controller I have ever used.  That said, I've only used two.  The other one was about a 15 year old model.  Towing a 14k pound 5th wheel, I had two options with the old one - locked wheels or almost no trailer braking.  I was also constantly having to adjust the braking setting to try to get around this.  No more.This brake controller just works.  Install it (make sure to get it installed parallel to the direction of travel - see the instructions for diagrams), set the type of brakes and trailer size and pretty much forget about it.  I went from using having to touch the brake controller just about every time I wanted to stop or slow down to touching it only about 3 times per trip.  I cannot recommend it highly enough.I opted for the vehicle specific wiring adapter.  Made the install much easier/quicker.Tekonsha 3035-P Brake Control Wiring Adapter for 94-C Fordis the wiring adapter for my 2000 F-450, but Amazon sells all the others.  Look up the right kit on Tekonsha's website.  Their search is a bit better. I installed this brake controller in a 1955 GMC pickup truck that I use for towing. Just follow the diagram for wiring and it just works like a breeze. I like the way you can adjust easily the voltage with the dial on the left and the mounts provided allows you to install it a convenient location under the dash (it works in any position).If you want to install this in a more modern truck without tapping directly into the wires, you will need additional adapters at extra cost. 
The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around! There are two horns, not one. One is 400Hz and the other one is 500Hz.PIAA | Automotive Sports Horn (400/500Hz) #85110The are exact fits on the mounts as the OEM horns and use the same bolts. A 1/4 inch drive ratchet and a 12mm socket is needed to remove and install the bolt. They came with grounding leads with ring spade lugs that mounted readily under the existing M6 bolts on the radiator supports. All you need is a 10mm socket.The two wiring harness leads are too short to connect the horns. Two wire tie mounts hold the harness to the aluminum bumper reinforcement. You can cut off the ties and use the OEM harness to connect the horns, but I chose not to.  I prefer NOT to cut off the OEM connector blocks.I made two pigtail extensions out of 18 gauge black primary wire, 5 inches long. One end needs a 1/4 inch wide exposed male quick disconnect. The other end needs an insulated female 1/4 inch quick disconnect terminal. Since I used 18 gauge wire, I used the red coded ones.The exposed male connector slides into the OEM horn connector perfectly. The female one clips easily onto the positive terminal of each horn.The horns how have a weather shield on the apertures.Best thing to my surprise is that they appear to be very high quality and Made in Japan.Also nice is that they need no modification to the horn relay or circuit. They fit perfectly onto the vehicle and or trailer wire when not in use. With the retaining loop they stay with the connectors when you are connected vehicle to trailer. 
I have some fog lights that I use on the back of my truck to light up the sides of my 5th wheel when I am pulling in to a camping spot at night. I got these so I can easly connect and disconnect these lights. They make it very easy to connect/disconnect anything you have that just needs power and ground. What can I say?  it is a replacement cap for the RV sewer connection.  I have not used the regular hose attachment, but I bought this one with it because the cost was not really any more and why not at least have the option.  Maybe someday I'll use it to backflush the black tank, but so far I've felt no need to. I've seen the reviews questioning the capacity of this cord, so I'm wondering if maybe there are changes in the cord.  The one I received is marked on the back of the package:"18 gauge wire""15 Amp Capacity"Now, I'm not an electrician, nor do I pretend to be one.  I don't know that 18G wire is sufficient to carry 15A.  I'll be using this for a small GPS that I mounted up high and I don't want the cord in the windshield. 
I like these allot they do a great job . Screwed up and lost one so I replaced it . I love the test lights on this one and they have a 7 5 4 that is very convenient . I prefer to wire evey truck and car with the 7 blades and go from there with adapters . As long as your vehicle was wired right to USA uniform standards you will be pleased . They are a little bulky but work very well . These lights will be the main lighting in my Teardrop Camper Trailer when I get back to work on it next spring.

I was hoping to use the clay bar to remove water spots on a new truck but the one provided with this Mequiar's kit was worthless for this purpose. The kit does include everything you need to apply the products in the kit which is a plus and probably the reason the kit is so popular. I installed this as an addition to a Python 991 system.  The sensor was simple to install and the color-coded wires and instructions were clear.  For the price, this is a lot of additional protection for the money. Returned found better kit with colors that help match RV. You need kit with colors to match most applications. 
I installed these in a 2nd generation Toyota Tundra. The fit was plug and play.The light is whiter than the stock bulbs (the stock bulbs have an orange hue to them). They did provide more light, but not the 50% more claimed. The OEM bulbs was 55W, and these replacements are also 55W. The manufacturer must be getting more lumens per watt, but I don't see how 50% would be possible.It is worth noting, my existing OEM bulbs were 5 years old and hence not as bright as they were when new. The improvement in brightness was also due to this fact.I'm going to see how long they last. If they don't last at least 2 years I'll be going back to stock OEM bulbs. The marginal increase in brightness is not worth the inconvenience and extra cost of having to keep swapping these out. My 5 year old bulbs were still working just fine, and I'll keep them as spares. These are great bulbs and work well as promised.Do keep in mind that Sylvania has several of these halogen bulbs and claims all kinds of brightness improvement over cheap bulbs.  The only difference is the color coating of the glass.  They use the same wattage as the cheap ones as required for H11.  If you want brighter then hack higher wattage bulbs (as I have done in the past) that are somewhat socket compatible or upgrade to HID. I bought these horns to replace the weak sounding horn that Toyota puts in the Corolla, Matrix, Prius, Yaris, ect.. These horns are very load to say the least. The Hella box included one low tone horn and one high tone horn. It also included instructions and a single Bosch style relay.There is NO wiring of any kind included with this purchase (this is why I gave it a 4 star). I made my own wiring harness which included a 30 amp fusible link, and the included relay and a relay socket. The following link is to the picture of my install on my 2006 Toyota Matrix XR:[...]Make sure you use the included relay in your install. I know some people have just used the existing single horn wire (not using relay), but these new horns have a pretty heavy amp draw! The last thing you want to do is mess up your factory wiring because of some horns. Do it the right way, and follow the instructions! Your horns will also sound better.You can not beat the price and sound quality of these horns! They will get your attention, I can promise you that.  I do recommend these horns! 
Ok so I figured I would write a review since these seem to be new to amazon and they had prime shipping so I went for them.Firstly these are ATO fuses.  The description doesn't say it anywhere for some odd reason however they also sell a mini fuse set which is labeled correctly and the picture shows ATO fuses.  Anyways, the fuses came in a box that is actually pretty nice and latches properly shut.  Label says 1 year warranty although their fuses so shouldn't have a problem.  On the other side of the boxes label is a chart showing Tan = 5amp, Red = 10amp, Blue = 15amp, Yellow = 20amp, Clear = 25amp, Green = 30amp.The fuses themselves seem to be very nice quality and have the number on them printed clearly however it is the plastic color and not painted white.  Note that the link that connects the two ends is horse shoe shaped rather than zigzagged which is something I personally have never seen before.At ~$10 it was a great price for 120 fuses + an actual working container. Installed these with the KC windsheild mounts on my 90 YJ. The harness and instructions were really easy to follow .Installed in less than 2 hours with everything tied down and hidden. My wife and I were out in the jeep looking at Christmas lights and I was on a dark road and flipped them on. WOW! These 130W daylighters definetely light up the road. They were so bright my wife asked if they were legal.Several things, you have two grounds, make sure they are grounded to a good metal surface, I used sandpaper to remove the paint about the size of a dime for my grounding points both in the engine compartment.If you have a narrow mounting location, you may want to consider the slim lights, these are heavy and shaped like a motorcyle headlight.The only negative thing I can say is that the light covers with the smiley face went out in the 80's. I painted mine black and placed a vinyl KC sticker on them. Looks much better, but still ordered the KC rock light covers so you can turn them on at any time without removing them. (5 stars if they would have come with a rock guard cover, instead of the solid yellow smiley faces.) Well to start, this unit seemed well built. Has a little weight to it so I think its built good. I only used it once because it has one poor design issue. "IT DONT LIGHT UP"..no lighted led screen monitor? Like doin a etch a scetch in the old days. lol...All fairness they left it out so you would buy the higher models I guess. Strange part is most of the cheap readers this company makes seem to have lighted displays.I live in an area were its dark at 5pm in the colder part of the yr. I need light. If you dont have sight issues or if you dont care if you have to hold a flash light while looking at codes then go for it...I returned it and bought the 1403. It does more anyway. If you do get the upper models be prepared to get a RS232 to USB adapter plug for them. Not sure why these are not updated to USB? Hope this helps...most people dont seem to care about the light but it makes such a big difference.

They have the direct replacement LEDs for RVs for most any fixture.You won't go wrong with these lights. These lights are very bright and have a excellent warranty. They work great on the A post of jeep wranglers. They are very easy to install great directions and guides. These are very good off road  light. These bulbs are fantastic! They aren't "blue" at all. Instead they are pure white. If you look at the bulbs when they're turned on, they give a tiny hint of blue, but the light they emit is completely pure white. They light up the road VERY well and reflect much better off objects than my previous stock halogens. A VERY good buy!! 
These bulbs work as described. The 4000Ks illuminate clear white for those who want no yellow or blue hues. They are definitely brighter than standard bulbs, but keep in mind nothing will emulate HID brightness. They are nice bulbs, but don't last near as long as factory bulbs, and the headlights in a 2004 Dodge Ram are so poor, that not even these bright bulbs help.  I had to mount off road lights to use with my high beams, to take care of the problem.  I'm sure these bulbs are fine for other vehicles, but there's no hope for factory 2004 Ram headlights. I have a 2005 Jeep Wrangler TJ Rubicon and this is perfect for converting the regular headlights/bulbs to aftermarket HID bulbs. The fit is perfect and, with the HID bulbs, it's extremely bright. In fact, it's so bright I am concerned I might get stopped by the cops (tip: stay with 35W HID bulbs and don't get the 55W HID bulbs).Highly recommend. 
I purchased this gauge on Amazon for $5.99 with FREE Super Saver ShippingIt is a handy tool and quite useful; the only drawbackfor me  is that it only measures in imperial measurements.Metric measurements are always more precise. these are original manufacturer type wires,  good materials used to make, but quality in testing before shipping is a problem.  when you receive them check the resistance value to make sure they are all  700 ohms or less. Considering this is made in China, it is a quality product, too bad all my locks are keyed to the some number 
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Great Fit 
I did not want the ghetto blue look at all ... but wanted brighter and a nice hint of the Whitish look (maybe with a tinge of blue) ... but these really look VERY close to the original basic cheap Sylvania bulbs. I can see a HINT of difference and not totally yellow but really all it adds a tinge (and I mean TINGE) more whitish but still primarily yellow.I saw the Sylvania Silverstar zXe models but the bulbs looked really blue and I thought it would give the ugly blue color so I went with the Ultras .... kinda thinking the zXe's would have given me more of the look I was going for.If you want regular yellow with a SLIGHT hint of white (hardly any) but brighter then stock then these are good ... if you want a more HID look with more whiteish look then go with the zXe's as those should give you more of what you want (I am returning these for the zXe's in hopes they are what I am wanting).I did more research on the zXe models and though the bulb is blueish most all reviews say it is NOT lbue at all ... just really white and that was what I wanted ... I know I couldn't get an HID look from a bulb but I wanted something close and still have the same brightness if not more then the regular bulbs.They are ok but just not the white kinda bright like they advertise and I thought they would be plus the brightness really isn't any brighter to me in my GMC Sierra then the basic cheap Sylvanias we're.Overall totally not worth the money. I purchased these for my 2001 Chevy S-10 truck, not because I needed them but because I wanted a better looking,whiter bulb.I had previously replaced all of the standard external bulbs with LEDS I have not been disappointed with any of my choices. They all  look pretty cool. I did have to re-aim the headlights to illuminate the road closer to the truck but GM made that very easy to do. I know some reviewers said that they don't last more than about a year but that remains to be seen. I also feel that they are whiter and brighter than the Sylvania equivilant. I just made the switch from the traditional sealed beams on my E30 to some Hella H4's and H1's so I needed some bulbs that would emit a bright white light since I could do that in the new headlights. I almost went for the generic yellow bulbs that allegedly last longer, but I am so glad I didn't and spent a few extra pennies on these. They are so bright that when I combine them with the high beams which are also the same type of high performance bulbs these are, I can see almost a full mile down the highway at night. The generic sealed beams lit up the road well, but nowhere NEAR as much as these do.And for all of the people complaining and moaning about these high performace bulbs not lasting very long: DO NOT TOUCH THE GLASS OF THE BULB!!! This will allow the oil on your hands to get onto the bulb so when it heats up during operation, it heats it up even more, cracks the bulb, and there you have it. Roasted bulbs. So when you are handling them, I suggest you use rubber gloves and don't even THINK about touching the glass of the bulbs. Instead, handle the bulbs by the metal endings so you do will not crack the bulbs. Use your heads before you bash a high quality product and undermine its reputation.

They work great on the A post of jeep wranglers. They are very easy to install great directions and guides. These are very good off road  light. Decent lights but I can not tell that much difference between these and the original JK lights.  They are certainly no where close to the HID lights. I did expect them to be brighter though. No great loss though. It is always good to have some spare bulbs when off-road. 
I bought these at a well known camping store.  They work pretty good.  The plastic pins are not fastened in though, so I put a dab of superglue on each side of the pin (at the edge of the fabric) and now the pins are securely in place.I also was not a big fan of the hooks... so I used some small binder clips.  If you squeeze the metal tab on the binder clip you can pop it out of the clip - then feed it through the grommet and put the tab back into the clip.  Now you have a secure clip to hold your lights!This requires you to slide the tabs off the awning before rolling it back up.I downgraded this to 4 stars since they didn't have the plastic pins fixed into place.This is a much better way to hang lights than using clothespins to attach them to the flap of the awning.  We had some storms when we were camping and not a single string of lights came off.  (I had tie-downs on the awning)So buy these, get some binder clips, and get a tube of superglue and you will be all set. Advertised for RV refrigerators, but works great in all my suitably sized RV cabinets to keep stuff put during travel.Adjustable for length (16 to 28 inches) by just twisting the end (1 turn lengthens or shortens bar by about 1/4 inch).Once adjusted to slightly longer than needed length, they have a stout internal spring that keeps them in place (spring action is about 1/4 inch).End-caps are medium hard plastic and very durable. In cases where I have extremely slippery walls, I have purchased cheap soft rubber end caps from the local hardware store to but on the bar ends. The soft caps don't hold up as well as the stock ones, but definitely stay put better on slipper wall surfaces. Purchase these bars and a few inexpensive soft end-caps and you can handle all situations.Bars are lightweight but fairly durable in use. I have yet to have one fail.Recommended I recently purchased/installed these tail light guards on my Jeep Wrangler JK.Aside from being incredibly simple to install (replace factory screws with included longer screws), they look very nice and are crafted from a pretty tough metal.We all know that these guys aren't really going to protect your tail light, aside from maybe a stick or two.I mean face it, if you have backed into a wall/huge tree/boulder enough to hit your tail lamps, you probably aren't going to explain, "Oh no! My tail lights!"You will likely be concerning yourself with your now mangled rear-door and wheel mount, or the fact that you just crunched your corner panels.What it does do though is make the tail light assemblies much more rugged looking, and they nicely trim the rear of the Jeep.The factory tail lamps are a bit plain compared to the rest of the vehicle, this is a perfect (and relatively cheap) way to remedy that...~Rusty 
Screws are very soft and are easy to strip and not stainless.Plate is flimsy so think thoroughly about how to secure it best These are some nice door guards. Just locate them carefully and stick them in position with the adhesive tape that's already there. they look good and are reasonably priced. I don't know why Wranglers don't come with some kind of door sill protection, but these are inexpensive and easy enough to apply.Look great, appear to be durable, and have no odd edges to snag. 
This filter arrived in good condition when ordered directly from Amazon.com.  The original box was packaged inside a shipping box.  It came with good directions including photos.  Even though the printed directions did not list my 2009 highlander, it was a perfect fit, and the photos matched my glove box.  When I compared this $9 TYC filter to the OEM original, I could not see any differance.  Note - the original OEM had an "up" arrow printed on it, but the TYC had an "air flow" arrow printed on it.  The filters, just like filters for you home furnance, have two differant types of sides.  One is a "fuzzy" side, and one a more "frame like / structured side". These filters have a fuzzy side, and a slightly rough plastic side.  When you pull the old one out, note which side is up and which one down, and put the new one in the same way.  In my case, the fuzzy side went "down" closest to the visible fan. I grew up in the 80's so I remember well playing with Legos.  Building everying from cars to forts.  Well the Tri Lynx Comapny has brought us back our nostalic youth with Tri Lynx Levelers.  These are large square plastic pads (roughly 9"x9"x1" thick) that are stackable to just about any confgiuration you can imagine.  You can stack them in a "column" fasion for leveling jacks.  Or you can stack them in an offset alternating "brick wall" fasion for an interlocking leveler that is safe to drive on without fear of displacement.  They can even be stacked side by side for larger duel wheel RVs.  For my use, I wanted to use them for my leveling jacks and for pads were there was a side leaning tilt.  The box says to never stack more than 4 levelers high for a single configuration.  I've gone to 10 under my jacks and they still feel rock solid once pressure is put on them.I'm on my 4th set of Lynx levelers.  I'm convinced you can't have too many.  With that I fianlly invested in these "Stop'n Chocks"  Wonderful!!!  As I said these can be used under your wheels as well.  So the Stop n' Chalk stacks as the last piece at the rear of the Lynx configuration to allow the driver  just back up against them.  Now these are the most versitle set of leveling / chalking pads you can buy becasue they allow for front to rear leveling and side to side leveling.  If one side of the coach is lower than the other, you can build up just that side and use standard chalks on the other.  Also if you have enough of the Tri Lynx levelers you could potentially place say 2" of lift under a front axel on an tandem configuration and 4 or even 5" under a rear.  The one draw back is that you would need enough to building this as one continous pad (say 8' long or so.)  But like legos, if you have enough, your imagination is the limit.A couple of notes:  You MUST use these in conjunction with TriLynx levelers.  They will not work on their own.  In addition there is a noctch carved out of the front to force the user to stack in the above mentioned "brick wall" alternating fasion so that there's no risk of sepertaion between the levels as the rig is driving on or off the pad.  Also, I stongly suggest a spotter!  Driving a rig on or off a 9" wide "rail" is dangerous and having someone to tell you that you a little too close to the edge is a must. I just used these pads for under my stabilizer jacks (see picture).  They work as described for my RV trailer.  Sturdy, hard plastic with a flat side and an indented, grid on the other side.  The velcro strap holds them together nice and neat.  I'm not sure these would work for motorhome jacks, however.  They work great for me. 
These are typical hard plastic handles, contoured for grip. The stock bar is substantial at 7/16". Edges are finished nicely. The metal shaft is unpolished and has a finish to prevent slippage.I don't care if all my hand tools are the same color, if it matters to you then note these may come in a different color than illustrate (see my pics).Made in the U.S.A. - nice.j Yes, these are wheel chocks.  They're not fancy, but they will hold a round piece of rubber just fine. with plastic bumpers being the norm, thought I'd use this plastic polish.  It brings the shine to the plastic painted areas just like step 2 does to the metal. 
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!! Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. 
Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. Product shipped quickly. It is as described and will work fine for my vehicle. Do not order the Reese Power ball 72802 as the hitch mount is 3/4" and the draw bar is 1" mount. You'll need a bushing or return it for a larger mount. 
Very quick and easy mounting and really adds to the look of the rear of the Jeep.  These are metal and not a cheap plastic and mount with included screws into the existing lens cover screw holes. The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around! Needed to replace a broken mirror.  This one fit right onto the existing metal holder that was still cemented to the windshield.  It has a lock-screw to hold it in place.  If you need to replace the metal holder, it is included but no glue is supplied.  Overall, it is a perfectly fine basic mirror. 
it works, but my only gripe is that the hardener should be double the size, as it takes 2x the amount to properly cure this stuff in my experience, which makes the difference between dirt hard and rock hard. My last bottle of wax was Mothers California Gold. To be honest I can't tell any difference between that and the NuFinish either in applying it or the end result. Both are great. dropped right in and made a noticeable difference. Went from about 17 mpg to about 22 mpg highway. The plus is its also reusable. 
My wife is a bit sh... lets say Vertically Challenged. I recently aquired a Jeep Wrangler with a 4&#34; Lift and big mudders. the bottom of the door reaches the middle of her. Climbing in has been difficult, so I purchased these Rampage Grab Handles. They are great, and secure, I don't have to worry about them slipping. This hitch extension is &#34;adjustable&#34; because it has two holes on the &#34;male&#34; end of the receiver, and two holes on the &#34;female&#34; end.  Depending on how you insert this extension into your vehicle (hole one or two), and how you insert your bike rack or whatever else into the &#34;female&#34; end (hole one or two), there is some adjustment on how much extension you achieve.  In theory.I was hoping to use the SMALLEST amount of extension with this so that I'd achieve about 7&#34; of extension.  I needed to extend my Thule T2 bike rack just enough to clear a larger-than-factory Jeep tire.i am able to use the hole that positions this extension furthest into my Jeep (so the &#34;male&#34; of this extension is adjustable).  Unfortunately, I was not able to utilize the deepest hole in the &#34;female&#34; end of this extension because there is only about 2&#34; of space between that deeper hole and an internal ridge where the inside square bar is welded to the outside square bar.  Hard to describe, but essentially my Thule bike rack it the back of this extension before the holes lined up with the deepest hole in this extension.So.. I suppose you could blame that on my bike rack?  In hind sight though, I wouldn't trust any bike rack that only had that little amount of metal behind the holes--just not enough there to handle the load.  No.. I think that this extension could have been better designed to just have ONE hole on the &#34;female&#34; end, but position it somewhat in-between the two that it currently has.  I doubt that there are many racks out there that could utilize the deepest hole in this extension's &#34;female&#34; side...One additional comment.. I read some reviews that criticized the welds.  I am not a welder, but in my observation, the welds seem smooth and uniform all the way around this.  I must say that the metal is a little thin compared to other extensions that I've seen.  I think it's quite fine for any 2-bike rack out there, and I'm using it for that.  When I set up to carry 4-bikes, I do worry that this may snap though, and I am pursuing another extension for that reason.Conclusion:  If you are only carrying 2 bikes, and you are happy with the extension possibilities IGNORING the deepest hole in the &#34;female&#34; part of this extension, I recommend it.  The price is reasonable and the integrated locking bolt is really nice (especially if you buy their optional locking bolt.)If you want a very short extension, this probably won't work.If you plan to carry 4 bikes, I don't know if this is strong enough.  I'm using it for that occasionally, but I'm a little worried about it... They're light, they're tough, they work.  I have no qualms with sliding under my car when they're on these ramps.HOWEVER -- Because they're light, you want to use them only with drive wheels, otherwise they won't stay in place as you climb the ramps.  And because they're light, I'd advise using them only with smaller vehicles.  Honda Civic?  Yes.  Crown Vic?  No.And regardless of what kind of ramp I use, I always position an extra floor jack under the car "just in case". 
works well Works as well as expected, The number and variety  of pieces comes in quite handy for small  delicate work.This is what is needed to get the job done. Works great on my 2012 Wrangler Sport. Heavy duty rubber that fits well in my hitch receiver and looks like it will last awhile. 
I bought a set of these ramps and they flat out don't work on my 2010 Dodge Ram 1500 4x2.  In my garage and/or on an asphalt parking lot they don't stay put.  When I drive up them they slide forward and my truck just scoots them along.  I have to "hold" them in place by using rubber floor mats and/or wood stoppers.  Yes, they have the rubber feet on their base but they don't hold.  Hate them....and wouldn't buy them again.  I returned them. i used it to insulate my headlight on my motorcycle! (i put in an hid light) not the most flexible stuff but can be cut up and set nicely! put a nice coating on my caliper slide pins.  It is really good.  I slathered the rod with lube and slid it in the hole.  Reminded me of something else but I couldn't put my finger in it... 
These are a huge improvement over the original halogen bulbs in my car.  They are whiter, brighter, and shine farther than the yellowish originals.  It was definitely a noticable difference, and much needed for night driving in an area with a huge deer problem (S.E. Minn). it works, but my only gripe is that the hardener should be double the size, as it takes 2x the amount to properly cure this stuff in my experience, which makes the difference between dirt hard and rock hard. I could tell the difference it made in my limited slip differential . It was quieter and seemed smother . to soon to tell if it made a difference in mileage . Yes I would recommend it to a friend .Paul 
These lights will be the main lighting in my Teardrop Camper Trailer when I get back to work on it next spring. They look like good quality lights and the switch works perfectly on them. I connected one of them to 12v and they are nice and bright. The diffusers are great and do a good job of diffusing the light with no lines or shadows. These lights are very light weight, but that is not a concern as I am building my Teardrop as light as possible.If you are after LED lighting, these are also a good choice because you can easily upgrade the bulb to an LED Retrofit from most any Automotive supply store, Amazon, or Ebay. They have the direct replacement LEDs for RVs for most any fixture.You won't go wrong with these lights. I replaced my Sylvania bulbs with these for Low Beams and these are just great!Good vision, white light, great coverage and none of that 'dingy' blue hue...I also bought/used the PIAA 9005 Intense White High Beam bulbs..... These bulbs are bright, but you need to remember that: Ebay HIDs &#60; These Bulbs &#60; HIR &#60; HID.  If you think that the PNP HIDs are the best thing out there then go buy them if you however want a bright light that will not get you flashed at these are for you. 
Just received the tail bag and it looks to be of good quality workmanship. I was surprised to find out it had a rain cover that also doubled as a safety reflector. You can never have too many visibility features on a motorcycle! It comes in a nice box and the instructions on how to install are clear. I have some soft-sided sport bags on my bike already but I'm considering getting the matching set for this tail bag to make it all look cohesive and to take advantage of its built-in compatibility with this unit. Nice Cordura material which should keep my stuff safe and dry for the most part. It's big enough for a shaving kit, some underwear, spare gloves, etc. This are sooooo useful. I can't tell you how many of those stupid hooks or fasteners i broke before discovering these in a car forum. I hate those plastic fasteners. This solved my problem, they are perfect and has several different shapes and sizes. Thank god i found these.  I don't understand how people can give these bad ratings. I purchased the 12' feet long cable set and they arrived in a retail cardboard box with handle, which could be used as a storage and carrying case for these cables, although I will not need to store them with the carry box.  These are high quality long cables of high grade materials and I believe worth the price I paid for them.  They will store in the back seat storage compartment of my truck easily.  Recomend. 
please note these are not white - but beige... other than that they are standard rv baggage catches I use these in the home garage and am not a master mechanic.  This feeler gauge set is great buy.  The feelers are clearly laser marked in both in and mm.  There is a great variety to create any thickness you want to gauge.  They easily come apart to create a gauge or rearrange your most used to the top.  These were the same OEM brand offered at my local Autozone for half the price. I purchased these items more for style than function.  They do look great, but are not made of high quality components.  The metal seems stamped, and the attachment screws look like wood screws instead of the original metal screws.  Easy to install.  I wish that they would have been offered in flat black. 
strong.installs in seconds.simple design.looks great.back seat passengers use them ALL THE TIME.i have the overhead handles by rugged ridge on the roll bars and i got these to supplement those,but these are actually used more by folks in the back seat.they fit my 2012 jk wrangler perfectly but will work on any vehicle that has the two metal posts on the head rests.(as long as you can remove the headrest)it literally took me 60 seconds to install both of these into my jeep.def recommend these to any one who ones a 4 door jeep.good price.will last for years to come. Fits a little tight especially around the front fender and floorboards but it works.  I have a 03' Shadow ACE 750cc.  After a couple rain storms I can report my bike stayed dry (except a portion of the front wheel) and through heavy winds, the motorcycle cover stayed put.  What&#8217;s nice about this cover is the price and how it has elastic hooks to secure the cover in place.  If you decide to buy a cover and your bike has a windshield, floor boards and aftermarket mirrors I recommend you buy a 2XL (if your bike is similar in size to a Shadow 750cc).  Look at the picture I posted, mine has stock mirrors and no windshield and fits VERY tight.  My mirrors shift out of place when the cover is on.  Before each ride I have to adjust them cause the cover is soo tight.  Also, if you have floor boards that&#8217;ll make the fit even more tighter.  Buying one size bigger and I would say you bike will be 100% covered. Works great. Fairly easy swap.

Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. 
A new article by consumer reports tested these all out.  The result?  Well, they simply just give you a "whiter light".  Distance wise, really don't help you see any farther.They do burn a lot hotter and I am worried about them melting the socket that plugs in the back of them, mine seemed to be a bit distorted when I removed mine.They lasted about a year and I don't drive half as much as most people.  There are better bulbs out there like the Phillips Extreme Power, put those one after these burned out and they seem a lot better, but who knows. If your bulbs are easy to change out if you are on the road and you can do them yourself and keep a cheap spare pair of bulbs in your glove compartment just in case, maybe ok, I won't buy this particular bulb anymore, would rather get the cheap Phillip 5 dollar per bulb one.But if your car has bulbs that are hard to change or you have no idea how to change your own bulbs, you are better off getting regular light bulbs that last years so you don't have to change them again I installed these in a 2nd generation Toyota Tundra. The fit was plug and play.The light is whiter than the stock bulbs (the stock bulbs have an orange hue to them). They did provide more light, but not the 50% more claimed. The OEM bulbs was 55W, and these replacements are also 55W. The manufacturer must be getting more lumens per watt, but I don't see how 50% would be possible.It is worth noting, my existing OEM bulbs were 5 years old and hence not as bright as they were when new. The improvement in brightness was also due to this fact.I'm going to see how long they last. If they don't last at least 2 years I'll be going back to stock OEM bulbs. The marginal increase in brightness is not worth the inconvenience and extra cost of having to keep swapping these out. My 5 year old bulbs were still working just fine, and I'll keep them as spares. Great design for an oil filter. The hex tip makes it super easy to change (no more strap wrench for me!) Unfortunately, I didn't get to use this exact filter, as the bike it was going on threw a rod before the oil change. But I have used these filters on other bikes, and can say for sure these work great, and are easier to change than a standard filter. Worth the few extra bucks, and I'll defiantly but K&N again. 
Easy to mount and adjust. Since each one is made identical (there is no right or left, you just mount the mirror differently), one has the tensioner lever right next to the mirror (drivers side in my case). That is not a problem if you place it back from your mirror. Good sturdy mount and no vibration. Once adjusted they are easy on and off. The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around! These KC&#8217;s light up dark & lonely places with brilliant, far reaching, white light even better than I had imagined they would. Install was easy on my &#8217;11 JK using Smittybilt 7690 brackets. The switch works great & adjustment of the beams was easy & positive with a 14mm wrench for the horizontal & a 13mm socket & extension for the vertical. Antenna interference with the passenger side light was avoided by angling the antenna back behind the light. Nice product!

I had purchased another brand that claimed to be 'universal' but it did not fit the larger Airstream coupler.  The product fit although I did have to turn it backward (key hole facing the trailer). 
Does what it says it does......looks great ! These item does fit perfect on my 2004 BMW x3. does what its suppose to do. so far so good thanks fits my car perfectly, works perfectly, was easy to install. The best measure of a wiper blade is that it does what it is supposed to do, when it is supposed to do it. 
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. Exact replacement from OEM. Exact fit worked perfect . Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs. Great Fit 
I bought these to put in my fog ballasts for a 2013 Nissan Sentra, and the zXe's for my low beams.  Honestly, I am more impressed with the output and color from the zXe's than these SilverStar's.  Save a few bucks and get the zXe's.  You won't be disappointed.  The stock Nissan bulbs were horrible, producing a yellow like light cast.  I wanted an upgrade to something more white and brighter.  I thought these SU SilverStar's would make my fog lights better but they did not.  It's probably because of the ballast and aim of the fog house assembly.  However, they did improve side lighting for reading road signs and seeing better on the driver side.  Nissan built a crappy fog ballast and the only solution is to upgrade to HID's.  Not going down that road, but I did try these and got some improvement, but not what I expected. I needed some new bulbs for my Hella H1 headlights since I made the switch from the generic sealed beams on my E30 to some German made headlights that have a way better lighting pattern (even though they are not DOT legal, hehehe). These are good, reasonably priced bulbs that will suit your headlight bulb needs. They aren't as bright as the high performace Xenon bulbs, but they will light up the road enough for you to see it. So if you want to get some H1's but don't want to break the bank or pay dealer prices, get them here from Amazon. I purchased these for my 2001 Chevy S-10 truck, not because I needed them but because I wanted a better looking,whiter bulb.I had previously replaced all of the standard external bulbs with LEDS I have not been disappointed with any of my choices. They all  look pretty cool. I did have to re-aim the headlights to illuminate the road closer to the truck but GM made that very easy to do. I know some reviewers said that they don't last more than about a year but that remains to be seen. I also feel that they are whiter and brighter than the Sylvania equivilant. 
I put this on my hitch attached to my camper to get room past my spare tire when hauling bikes.  Highly reconned!! When you get it cheaper than wal-mart, everyone wins.  It fit my trailer which has a tire gap of almost 6 inches. Has my '10 Mini Cooper shifting like butter even in single digit temps. I've never beendisappointed in a Redline product. 
I highly recommend these mirrors. I did a lot of looking and comparing before I bought these. I have a 2006 Toyota Tacoma and these things fit well and do a real nice job. They vibrate a little but not excessive. The little bit of vibration I see doesn't interfere with my view. I also do not extend them very far. The further out you go with them the more they will vibrate. Just extend to the minimum needed in order to be able to see.Before attaching to the vehicle I think it's a good idea to loosen the three screws holding the swivel in place on the bottom of the mirrors and work in a drop of oil. Then do not over tighten these screws. They don't have to be very tight to hold the mirror still and not over tightening allows easy adjustment later. If you find they move when you close the door you can tighten a little more but to start off, finger tight with the screwdriver is all you need. I also placed a couple drops of oil on the aluminum sliding bar and worked it in before attaching. Also, when you bolt the mirror onto the aluminum slide bar, grip the base (the part with the internal threads) with a vise-grip or something (not too tight to crush it), then make sure the lock nut is between the bolt and the bar on the bottom, and then screw the bolt into the base (and through the aluminum slide bar) nice and tight without letting the base turn. You'll notice there are &#34;teeth&#34; on the bottom of the base. These are supposed to sink into the bar as you tighten the bolt. They keep the base from turning when you adjust the mirror. This is another good reason to not overtighten the three screws around the swivel. You want to be able to adjust the mirror from side to side and have it turn only at the swivel and without causing the base to turn against the aluminum slide bar.The bracket will bend the weather stripping on the outside of the window a little. It springs back when the mirror is removed but some of it will be permanent. It's not a big deal and you'll just have to deal with this if you want to use these mirrors. It is not a detriment to the operation of the window.I installed them as far forward as possible so that the top of the bracket was parallel to the ground and the new mirror sits right beside my existing one towards the outside. Tightening the ratchet by hand produced plenty of tension to hold it securely. Releasing the ratchet is another matter. It's too tight to just push it down with your finger. To release the tension I use a short piece of rope and loop it under the sliding buckle. Then I stand right next to the truck with the rope looped around one hand and my other hand on the ratchet release tab. I use my body leverage (knees and back) to pull upward on the rope a little which takes just enough pressure off the belt to allow me to press the ratchet release tab. You don't need to back the ratchet off very far - just enough to get the hook out from under the door. Then just close up the bracket and wrap up the belt around it and you're all pre-set for the next time.For better stability I advise when you're adjusting the belt, place the sliding buckle as necessary so that the crossbar forming the angle is not extended very far, if at all. And, yes, make sure there isn't any dirt behind the buckle or you'll get a scuff mark.You should have the windows all the way down when attaching to the vehicle. The bracket comes close to the window so you need to be careful not to let it scratch the window. After you get the mirror on I advise to raise the window very slowly to make sure that the metal bracket is not contacting (scratching) the window as you raise it. Once you're under way - be sure not to lower the window if there is any sand or debris laying on the bracket right next to the window or a scratch may occur from this action also. I've taken these off and on several times now and we've travelled with them and I've been relatively careful and have never had one scratch my window.On my truck, the doors fit really well and I can tell the difference when the hook for the mirror strap is hooked under the door. The door fits just a tad more tightly than usual. It has to be closed just a slight bit harder to make the latch engage and when I open the door it pops out ever so slightly because of the extra tension produced by the hook being in there on the bottom. I don't see this as a problem. The mirrors are not on there all the time and, even if they were, I think the latch mechanism on the Toyota is stout enough to handle it without any long term problems developing. Just be aware that the hook will slightly change thge way the door latches.The instructions are good, too. Not the usual loosely translated Mandarin. I've tried to supplement here with my own experience. I bought a pair of these for my 2002 Grand Cherokee. It took a grand total of 5 minutes to install both of them, and half of that was spent looking for a screwdriver.If you are at all nervous about trying this, here is a overly detailed set of instructions.1. Open hood. Prop it open with something wooden so it doesn't fall on you.2. Identify the strut on the right side of the hood.3. Identify the small metal clip at both ends of the strut. If in doubt, look at the new ones. You are looking for a metal band, about 1/2 inch in width, with two small slots. On the vehicle, slide a small screwdriver blade into the clip's slots, and twist the screwdriver to pry the clip upward. You can remove it, or just loosen it enough that there is a good sized gap between the clip and the strut.4. Now pull the strut away from the hood/body. You may need to slide a screwdriver behind the strut arm to get a little bit of leverage. It is easier to start with the end attached to the hood.5. Remove both ends of the strut from the vehicle.6. Attach the new strut. Make sure the strut is aligned the same way as the old one-with the cylinder at the top of the strut. (Refer to the opposite strut). Just place the socket in the strut over the ball joint on the vehicle, and give it a little tap or squeeze with your hand. It should snap right on.7. Repeat on the other strut.Note- if it seems like the strut is too big, the hood is probably not open all the way. There is NO WAY you are strong enough to compress the strut by hand.I'd strongly recommend replacing them in pairs, otherwise you will get a twisting motion on your hood. Plus if one failed, the other one is close behind.That's it, you're done. I grew up in the 80's so I remember well playing with Legos.  Building everying from cars to forts.  Well the Tri Lynx Comapny has brought us back our nostalic youth with Tri Lynx Levelers.  These are large square plastic pads (roughly 9"x9"x1" thick) that are stackable to just about any confgiuration you can imagine.  You can stack them in a "column" fasion for leveling jacks.  Or you can stack them in an offset alternating "brick wall" fasion for an interlocking leveler that is safe to drive on without fear of displacement.  They can even be stacked side by side for larger duel wheel RVs.  For my use, I wanted to use them for my leveling jacks and for pads were there was a side leaning tilt.  The box says to never stack more than 4 levelers high for a single configuration.  I've gone to 10 under my jacks and they still feel rock solid once pressure is put on them.I'm on my 4th set of Lynx levelers.  I'm convinced you can't have too many.  With that I fianlly invested in these "Stop'n Chocks"  Wonderful!!!  As I said these can be used under your wheels as well.  So the Stop n' Chalk stacks as the last piece at the rear of the Lynx configuration to allow the driver  just back up against them.  Now these are the most versitle set of leveling / chalking pads you can buy becasue they allow for front to rear leveling and side to side leveling.  If one side of the coach is lower than the other, you can build up just that side and use standard chalks on the other.  Also if you have enough of the Tri Lynx levelers you could potentially place say 2" of lift under a front axel on an tandem configuration and 4 or even 5" under a rear.  The one draw back is that you would need enough to building this as one continous pad (say 8' long or so.)  But like legos, if you have enough, your imagination is the limit.A couple of notes:  You MUST use these in conjunction with TriLynx levelers.  They will not work on their own.  In addition there is a noctch carved out of the front to force the user to stack in the above mentioned "brick wall" alternating fasion so that there's no risk of sepertaion between the levels as the rig is driving on or off the pad.  Also, I stongly suggest a spotter!  Driving a rig on or off a 9" wide "rail" is dangerous and having someone to tell you that you a little too close to the edge is a must. 
stellar product for polishing, cleaning and keeping the bike looking great. She works on the engine, paint, fiberglass, plastic, chrome and anything else on the bike. DO BE CAREFUL SPRAYING ON THE SEAT OR TIRES I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND. This product doesnt come off too easily and will spread with heat. If you spray on the tires or seat it will look great but your butt and the bike will slide everywhere. You certainly don't want your expensive rack to get stolen.  This is cheap insurance.  Fits well and works well.  I do not leave my rack on all the time so this lock/pin does not see harsh weather or repeated rains.  For me, it works exceptionally well.  I like the fact that after it is unlocked, to relock doesn't require the key, you can just insert it back on and it is locked. This is a great little deterrent to thieves stealing your vanity license plates.  I'm happy.  It doesn't fit all cars.  Make sure it fits your car or else it might be too tight!! 
The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around! This is a must have for pickup truck owners.  The bar is easy to adjust and with the rubber feet stays firmly in place.  The ratchet part is very well made.  You can secure this and know for sure that your cargo is not moving.  Have had no problems at all..... Easy to replace. It lacks Toyota instructions, but it is exactly like existing Toyota part with all wires colored the same way so it is very obvious how to connect those.The original part has a silicone rubber tube going all the way from top to bottom with wires running inside it. This part only provides a short length of tubing that, at best, would cover half of the length of wires on my car.I thing they should provide a &#34;telescoping&#34; tubing of two diameters with one going inside of the other while you are crimping wires and then extended to cover the full length of wires 
I don't know if it is just mine but the locking pin is hard to retract (unlock).  It is easy to put on, is bright yellow so its easy to see by both me and potential thieves.  But unlocking is difficult, the locking pin wants to stay in the locked position and not retract with the key.  Maybe just mine, I don't know.  I would have given it a 5 if it worked better. Our new 5th wheel came with the cable pull valves.  They stink!  This way at least I can make sure the tank is empty before I pull off the sewer hose.  Easy to put on.  I especially like the way you can rotate it to whatever direction you need it to be. Really cool thing, it is digital so it doesn't matter where you put it, my electric recommended to put it in the middle under console so if someone will try to lift your car it will sense it instantly, because if you put it on one side and the car will be lifted from the other side it might not sense it. But then another electric came and said that it is digital sensor so it doesn't matter where to put it, finally they put it where it was easier for them :) even though I was asking them to put it in a middle as first one recommended in the beginning.And don't worry about parking your car on the hill - it will remember it is position once it is armed and won't trigger alarm, may be old gyroscope based ones were making triggering the alarm.We tested it then, lifted car from the other side and you had to lift your car about 3&#34; before alarm got triggered by this tilt sensor. I was joking that tires are already stolen because for me 3&#34; were to high and expectations were that it will trigger instantly once car lifted more than 1&#34;. But hey, not always you can force your electrics to do what you want them to do. 
Exactly what was offered, fit nicely, no major prep work, won't fade or crack, adjusts perfectly, easy removal and fits under seat in truck It fits perfectly to my 2005 Honda Accord.Filter quality seems to be good. bought this for my 2004 honda crv.  fit perfectly and cleared the code.  easy to do just give the threads some wd40 
I beleave I can really feel the difference in the power in the car can't tell the difference in mileage yet . The engine is quieter and smother running . Yes I would recommend this oil to all my friends.Paul Used this on my 2004 BMW 325Ci for my Transmission Fluid Change. Noticed an immediate difference on how the car shifts. I would recommend this product to all BMW owners I could tell the difference it made in my limited slip differential . It was quieter and seemed smother . to soon to tell if it made a difference in mileage . Yes I would recommend it to a friend .Paul 
This is a must for anybody who wants to keep their car clean between washes. My car sits outside, in parking garages, and old sheds. All of them seem to dump tons of dust on my poor car. This model comes with the wood handle. Others out there have a cheap plastic one. Read the directions on the cover. You're suppose to let it air out after shipping. It has something to do with the wax on the brush. It also will tell you not to worry about it getting dirty. In fact its suppose to work better as it gets dirtier. The duster will work even better if you put a sealant and/or wax on your car. You'll find that you can pull a lot more material off your car. The duster will easily remove pollen, dust, and any other light coating of material. It will remove the dust from hard water and rain deposits, but you'll still see the marks if you look carefully. Buy this product. You're call will thank you! This is my go to car wash. Just splash some onto a bucket and get to work. Gets rid of tough road debris and leaves a nice shine to my car. Perfect prep for hand waxing. This product works great because a) it's relatively cheap and b) gives a good shine without looking hideousBasically, it doesn't provide that ultra-greasy look you might get at a $50 detail operated by some homeless looking guy who applied a layer of grease to your tires.  Instead, you get a new-tire looking effect that simply looks good all the time.Easy to apply- just spray on.  However, make sure you try to spray on uniformly and don't put too much.  But before you do that, if you're applying this while the car is in your garage or driveway, cut up some cardboard boxes and drive over them.  This way, all the residual droplets wont stain your concrete.  Let the liquid sit for the recommend amount of time, then go out and use a paper towel to dab, not scrub, away excess dirt and liquid.  Make sure you do not leave any traces of liquid because if you do so, the next time you drive your car, centrifugal force will stream even small traces of excess liquid right off to your side panels. 
I put these on the tongue of my 28' travel trailer, and am able to level in half the time vs. using just  my side and front mounted levels.Well made, and the Included double stick tape seems to stand up to the elements, so no need to drill holes to mount.A good buy. It bothers me when front license plate is screwed directly to the bumper.  Considering the cost of these mounting brackets, I wish manufacturers included them as standard equipment; it would show their attention to detail.When I found Cruiser Accessories 79150 Mounting Plate it seemed like a good value.  I especially liked multiple slots for mounting onto the bumper.  These slots provide a good number of mounting and adjustment options.  I used the upper two vertical slots because they were spaced exactly like the existing holes in my car's front bumper.Unfortunately, there was a couple of frustrating issues that spoiled the experience:1.  Four screws that are included with the plate are too long.  I saw them being long and I am glad I checked for this before installing the mounting plate onto the front bumper.  I used included four screws to attach the license plate and the Black Cruiser Accessories 20050 Classic Lite frame to the mounting plate - screws' sharp tips protruded 1/4" from the back of the mounting plate.  If I had installed the mounting plate onto the bumper first and then tried to attach the license plate with the included screws, I would have damaged the front bumper in two places (the bottom two holes ended up over an air intake slot on my car).  I expect all pieces included with the product to be carefully engineered for that product and working properly.  These screws, obviously, are of the wrong size.  The fact that I had to go to Home Depot to find properly fitting screws not only was frustrating, but also increased the overall cost.2.  The thin pieces of plastic at the top and bottom of the mounting plate are too flimsy.  When I unpacked the plate, these areas of the mounting plate were slightly deformed: bent inwards. Fortunately, the license plate covered the problem.When the mounting plate is installed, it looks nice, so I am not completely disappointed; however, I found a similar product from Bell at Autozone, and it was cheaper (though Bell's mounting plate had very long screws too). I am only concerned about how accurate it actually is. There is a couple pounds difference between my tire pressure monitoring system on the car and this gauge. This gauge is closer to the TPMS system then the cheap pencil style pressure gauge I was using and was thinking all these years I may have been running my tires on the low side on my vehicles that didn't have that pressure system because of that pencil style gauge. It is easy to use and easy to read. 
I Bought a set of these pads and they were sized right for how I used them. I took the pads and screwed them into a 12&#34; 2x6 to give them extra strength and surface area. They provide a handy handle that I use to place my blocks. They are not, in my opinion, heavy duty enough to use as a stand alone jack pad, but work perfect for me the way I configured them. I grew up in the 80's so I remember well playing with Legos.  Building everying from cars to forts.  Well the Tri Lynx Comapny has brought us back our nostalic youth with Tri Lynx Levelers.

They're light, they're tough, they work.  I have no qualms with sliding under my car when they're on these ramps.HOWEVER -- Because they're light, you want to use them only with drive wheels, otherwise they won't stay in place as you climb the ramps.  And because they're light, I'd advise using them only with smaller vehicles.  Honda Civic?  Yes.  Crown Vic?  No.And regardless of what kind of ramp I use, I always position an extra floor jack under the car "just in case". 
This comes with 4 rubber feet that you install on the bottom.  Each foot is circular with a slot running from one side to the other that perfectly fits around the metal grate on top of RV stoves.  The board itself has pre-drilled pilot holes and a template that allows you to determine which holes to use for your particular stove.  It's a very well-done product.  The feet keep the unit in place during travel but it comes off easily when you want to use the stove.  The finish is very nice too so it looks excellent in place.  Highly recommend. Truly an impressive assembly of 4 parts. If there is a finer example of a little piece of rubbery roll-y wheel attached to a wooden handle with some metal parts in the middle tying it all together, show me. The cutting board is really nice!  Solid piece of wood and it has the RV shelf liner attached to it so it holds fast to the RV stove top.It also has the flexible plastic sheet (flexible stowaway cutting mat) included.  Wish I knew that before I bought the flexible plastic cutting mat but now I just have two. 
I use this Dexron replacement fluid in my 12,000+ pound F-Super Duty utility truck's ZF 5 speed transmission and parking brake unit-Group IV synthetic, and able to take the shock loads of a gear oil! Good gear oil for break in, always use this because it is cheap and comes in a gallon size. I then drain at 500 miles and put in Lucas synthetic in the required spec/weight. Do Not waste your money.  Bough a mid grade &#34;full size&#34; digital gauge and found this one to be off by 5lbs! 
Buy this right now.  I had a performance K&N; filter set-up on my Acura, but for some reason it never occurred to me to put a K&N; filter on my commuter car.  It popped up as a suggestion, and I purchased it immediately.  Right away I noticed snappier acceleration.  At the end of my 22 mile commute my mileage had already improved .5 mpg without resetting the computer.  I am floored.  I am fresh out of a dyno so I don't know if my HP increased, but based on my other two observations, combined with this being a lifetime product, I am ecstatic about this filter.Now, a little story about replacing my old filter with the K&N.;  I thought I was just going to open the air box, yank out the old one, slap in the K&N;, and then go about my day.  WRONG.  Big ol' thumbs down for Nissan making routine task a big undertaking.  If you have an Altima you had better get out your awesomeStanley 92-839 Black Chrome and Laser Etched Socket Set, 99-Piece.  Use your short 10mm and remove the intake hose from where it attaches to the box.  Then you can unclip the front clips, and the lid flips up.  You can unclip the sensor, but I did not.  Thank goodness I do not have to do that again for another 50,000 miles. I just got two of these for my avalanch. They are very load and easy to hook up and mount. I had to come back  and edit my review because one has blown out and the other one sounds funny w/o both working. I just ordered new horns and try to mount in a different spot. I was unaware you can Not mount these in oem position,evedently they are not water proof, soo, i will be replacing with different horns. Girlfriend's New Beetle's low beam headlight burned out a couple of days ago, so I nabbed two of these on here hoping to get them quickly. (Might I add, I'm very pleased with Amazon on the shipping, ended up getting it a day earlier than I should have, I have Prime).Anyways, put them in, and wow, what a difference from the previous bulbs in there. Previously I had been looking into an HID upgrade kit for her car just to get some decent light out in front of the car (No worries, they are projector housings, no way would I run HID's in reflectors, I'm not scum of the driving world :D ), well no longer am I going to bother. I put these in, readjusted the headlights a bit up and now the road in front of the car is incredibly well lit.I can't comment on longevity, as I just put these in earlier today, but should anything go abnormally wrong with them, I'll come back and update this review. Honestly though, for the 3 bucks a bulb I paid, I'll be perfectly pleased with them if they last a year, beyond that I'll be enthralled. 
As high beams are on only when its really dark I liked the increased field of vision how it increased the sides and the length of what I can see.  Yes I would buy them again. These really are significantly better than my OEM high-beams. After converting my low-beams and foglights over to HID, I wanted to get a bit more out of my highs, but I still wanted to be able to flash them, so another HID kit was out of the question. I picked these up, as I read that they are VERY bright, and they're about as white as you can get with a halogen.Well, they are EXTREMELY bright - by far the brightest high-beams I've ever had. As far as whiteness... while they're significantly better than my stock bulbs, they're still very yellow. They're definitely as good as you can expect, though - but they won't match your 5k HID's.I would definitely buy these again! I've put these on my motorcycle (DL650K7 if it matters) and although they are definitely whiter (4100K vs. 3500K of the stock bulbs), they don't seem to be much brighter or projecting noticeably wider beams. The only instrument in my posession is a photo light meter and it shows the difference of about 1/3 of a stop, which is rather negligible. Nevertheless, I like the whiter light, and I think that $40 is the right price for such an upgrade. Surprisingly for a Japanese cycle, the stock lights were also Sylvanias, so I expect these to last (one who rides should always carry a spare set of bulbs anyway). 
If you are looking to upgrade from sealed beam headlights to replaceable bulb halogen types, this is the way to go. Far more light is transferred to the road and ahead than before and with the same wattage bulbs. to those who wish to know the truth regarding PIAA light bulbs.the PIAA light bulbs are no better than stock light bulbs.i purchased my 2004 toyota corolla brand new. the stock lights burned out in the year 2011.do the math, seven years without a stock light burn out.stock lights are just as good or better than the overpriced PIAA light bulbs.PIAA 10926 9006 (HB4) Intense White - 9006 51W=115W Xtra Intense White Bulb, Twin Pack I have a 2005 Jeep Wrangler TJ Rubicon and this is perfect for converting the regular headlights/bulbs to aftermarket HID bulbs. The fit is perfect and, with the HID bulbs, it's extremely bright. In fact, it's so bright I am concerned I might get stopped by the cops (tip: stay with 35W HID bulbs and don't get the 55W HID bulbs).Highly recommend. 
Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars I replaced air filters in two Toyotas: 2003 4 cylinder Camry and 2006 4 cylinder Highlander. It fits perfectly, the installation is easy, and it was much cheaper on Amazon than at the dealer.  The only difference from the original Denso filters I purchased at a Toyota dealer is that Amazon's version's color is pink. I welded a piece of flat stock on the insert for the motorhome. This adapter is for my Dodge Grand Caravan. 
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. Even though Amazon says it does not fit my truck; it does fit my 2002 Chevrolet 2500HD crew cab with 6.0L gas engine. I replaced both sensors and harness. Both sensors were rough looking and the rear sensor had standing water on it. It was a little bit of a chore to get to them because you have to remove the intake but it was not too bad. Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. 
My Harley has a lot if black on the motor. It's a 2003 and very gradually the black will loose it's rich dark look. This product really brought back that dark rich look. I recommend it. Hella Replacement.  Kinda.  Mine came with BLUE wire.. they should always be white. Its also not covered in fabric and the white ones are. These bulbs work as described. The 4000Ks illuminate clear white for those who want no yellow or blue hues. They are definitely brighter than standard bulbs, but keep in mind nothing will emulate HID brightness. 
I have previously used in: 1980 Honda CX500C to fix a rough idle, 2000 Suzuki SV650 to stabilize fuel, and a 2005 Chevy Cobalt to fix a problem with stalling at idle. I mounted this as an auxiliary transmission cooler in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 with the 4.0.  No issues.  Obviously, this was a custom installation.  But with a little research on the jeep forums, no problem. Perfect fit for rear window on my 2004 Ford Excursion Limited. Easy to install. No spotting seen or squeaking at all 
work great for my John Deere X500 Nobody else has mentioned it.  This is the K&N size for anyone who uses the Ford FL1A.  It also works in place of the Derale 13092. bought this to use with my k2500 4x4 suburban as the standard jack no longer works with a lift kit and bigger tires.this is a must have for a hi-lift jack. with the 60" jack it works perfectly. i originally tried it with a 48" and it just wasn't enough due to the loss of about 8" of useable lift due to the chain hanging lower. 
This fit all four O2 sensors on my 2002 Toyota Tundra and I could have not completed the job without this specialized socket. Fits up to bank 1, sensor 1 O2 sensor on 2004 Ford Taurus 3.0L Vulcan Flex. Very high quality socket, which is expected from Lisle. Get the thread chaser from Lisle as well to be sure of a clean thread before installing the the new O2 sensor. Both the socket and thread chaser are offered on Amazon at a very good price. They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. 
Originally, I purchased this for a vehicle engine air intake -- cooler air = more mpg/power.  However, I found that it works well for high temperature halogen lighting fixtures.  In the winter, CFL take too long warm up in a garage door opener.  So, I employ 150 watt halogen lamps.  Even with the translucent fixtures removed, the lamps still melt the dark plastic housing on the garage door opener.  With this heat barrier covering all of the nearby surfaces, not only is the plastic housing protected but better light out is realized. I used this on the interior walls of the air chamber of my fireplace insert to absorb the blower noise.  I did not notice a dramatic difference.  It is on the bottom of the plenum where the cool air goes in, not in the top portion.  There were no problems with odor or melting from the heat radiating through the bottom.  I don't know what would happen if I burned wood without turning on the blowers. Works as expected. Fit without any issues. Quality seemed good and have not had any issues with air pressure or smells. 
How can one really rate it, as it is used for protection and no idae how long it should last, yet is was as listed so I give it the benifit ogf the doubt... Great price and is what I was expecting it to be and do. Not sure how long it will last, time will tell. This product works as advertised. There are so many products meant to shine your tire and some last long and some don't. This one last for a few days to a couple weeks in my experience. The reason I say this is because depending on where you drive is how long it will last for. This stains your tires to make them shine. Try is yourself and you wont be disappointed.If this review helped you please let me know. Thanks and happy shopping. 
I put these in my '03 TJ Jeep Wrangler.  They fit perfect and work exactly as you'd expect they should.  I installed a set of 55w HIDs in them and the light output is tremendous. Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones.

Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. This works great. It's sturdy and fit's nice and snug in a standard 5 gallon bucket. I will be ordering more of these in the future. 
A nice charger. Is also smaller than it appears on the picture. So easy to carry and handle.Unfortunately I had to send it back because it just has the standard clamps to charge.There were no &#34;Quick Disconnect Extension&#34; option to easy plug-n-charge a motorcycle.So I bought the &#34;Black & Decker BM3B 6V and 12V Battery Charger / Maintainer&#34;:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051D3MP6/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0 I purchased these to increase my light output on my motorcycle.

I have previously used in: 1980 Honda CX500C to fix a rough idle, 2000 Suzuki SV650 to stabilize fuel, and a 2005 Chevy Cobalt to fix a problem with stalling at idle. It fits perfect on my riding mower 18.5 hp B&S engine.Phram is a excellent quality replacement oil filter for my mower engine Replaced the "nasty nissan matic fluid" with this in the transmission and also used it in the power steering and transfer case in my 2005 nissan titan. 
These are not your cheap run of the mill clips. They are very thick and durable; solder joints on clips are good too. This product is definitely well made. Screws are very soft and are easy to strip and not stainless.Plate is flimsy so think thoroughly about how to secure it best For myself, these might work? Only because my car is very small and barely weighs 1800lbs. These are not solid, they are a thinner plastic, maybe 1/4 of an inch thick. They do however stack together nicely to make it easier to store them.

This works exactly as you expect. If your gap is too small, you can just slightly tilt the entire gauge while measuring the gap, and the gap will extend some... that is, measure, push to extend, re-measure, and repeat until you have the right gap.You can also use the inside of the small ring area to expand the gap. This is where I think the tool could improve. The small edge of the wedge on the inner ring could be smaller. Once, I happened to tap my gap too small to fit on that wedge, and had some trouble getting the gap to open back up enough to again work on the gauge.All in all, though, this is a necessity in my motorcycle tool bag. I bought a pair of these for my 2002 Grand Cherokee. It took a grand total of 5 minutes to install both of them, and half of that was spent looking for a screwdriver.If you are at all nervous about trying this, here is a overly detailed set of instructions.1. Open hood. Prop it open with something wooden so it doesn't fall on you.2. Identify the strut on the right side of the hood.3. Identify the small metal clip at both ends of the strut. If in doubt, look at the new ones. You are looking for a metal band, about 1/2 inch in width, with two small slots. On the vehicle, slide a small screwdriver blade into the clip's slots, and twist the screwdriver to pry the clip upward. You can remove it, or just loosen it enough that there is a good sized gap between the clip and the strut.4. Now pull the strut away from the hood/body. You may need to slide a screwdriver behind the strut arm to get a little bit of leverage. It is easier to start with the end attached to the hood.5. Remove both ends of the strut from the vehicle.6. Attach the new strut. Make sure the strut is aligned the same way as the old one-with the cylinder at the top of the strut. (Refer to the opposite strut). Just place the socket in the strut over the ball joint on the vehicle, and give it a little tap or squeeze with your hand. It should snap right on.7. Repeat on the other strut.Note- if it seems like the strut is too big, the hood is probably not open all the way. There is NO WAY you are strong enough to compress the strut by hand.I'd strongly recommend replacing them in pairs, otherwise you will get a twisting motion on your hood. Plus if one failed, the other one is close behind.That's it, you're done. I wish the tool was about an inch longer. For a 1995 VW Jetta, with the tie rod inserted, I can't clip the wrench part in place because the tool is about a quarter inch too short. It's still usable but the wrench part won't clip in place so there's a lot more fumbling around. 
The Meguiar's X2020 are the best bang for the buck, bar none!  What separates them from MOST other microfiber towels is that they are LARGE in size.  Most other microfiber towels, including the popular Zwipes here on Amazon are much smaller so you need 2-3 of them to do what 1 of these X2020's do.  The X2020's are also high quality and remove wax or detailing polish/liquid so smoothly.  The roughly $2 or so price per towel is pricey but b/c of what they do, it's definitely worth it.  Next time Amazon has a sale, i'm loading up on these again. The Tender Jr. does not come with a cigarette adapter so I cut this in half to make two. I purchased 2 lighter plugs for a buck each from China&#8230; with free shipping&#8230; and they are working fine. These aren&#8217;t an exact match with the Tender cables but they fit together OK and are easy to determine polarity with the wire colors. You can also just use this as an extension cord for your Tender. The description states a length of 12-inches&#8230; but it&#8217;s actually 14-inches tip-to-tip on the connectors. Nice item for the price and it&#8217;s made in Mexico. A good Made in USA chock.  It may cost about a buck less each at Walmart, if you can find it.There is a hole in the side for a rope to hold one or two together for each side of the tire.  Don't buy the one with a rope. It costs twice as much for the same one chock, NOT two.The heavy rubber  Buyers Rubber Wheel Chock - 5in.W, Model# WC1467A  at $8.99 each at Northern Tools are heavier and provides a better grip on concrete, but they are heavy to carry around.  I use the Buyers' ones in the garage and carry the Camco ones in my trunk.Also NOTE that the Buyer's ones are made in the same place as the expensive Race Ramps Branded ones costing 50% more.  The Buyers ones are nearly identical, are exactly the same size and weight.  The Race Ramps ones have shallow slits cut into the bottom. 
These are not your cheap run of the mill clips. They are very thick and durable; solder joints on clips are good too. This product is definitely well made. Just awesome  and  made  of the same quality that the spendier ones are .. If you are shopping for devices like this  just save some money and buy this one .. it's great and the  wieght and  finish  are top notch !!! These are well made, inexpensive, and work great. They are quality made in USA!And they had no shipping charges if added onto an existing Amazon order. 
These are not your cheap run of the mill clips. They are very thick and durable; solder joints on clips are good too. This product is definitely well made. Screws are very soft and are easy to strip and not stainless.Plate is flimsy so think thoroughly about how to secure it best For myself, these might work? Only because my car is very small and barely weighs 1800lbs. These are not solid, they are a thinner plastic, maybe 1/4 of an inch thick. They do however stack together nicely to make it easier to store them. I wouldn't recommend these to anyone, not even a Go-cart racer.When I seen RhinoGear I imagined thick sturdy rubber chock-blocks not thin plastic cups. 
Very quick and easy mounting and really adds to the look of the rear of the Jeep.  These are metal and not a cheap plastic and mount with included screws into the existing lens cover screw holes. I decided to try these out, and I'm glad I did! The black ones look really god in combination with the carbon fiber license plate frame I also got from Amazon -REAL 100% CARBON FIBER LICENSE PLATE FRAME TAG COVER FFSince most plates only use two screws, one set covers front and rear (If you are lucky enough to live where a front plate is required)The white ring mounts like a washer under your mounting screws, and the black cap just snaps over the top. Seems to hold well enough to not fall off, but they pull of easily if you have to get to your screws. Another reviewer mentioned that they trap water in and rusted his mounting hardware. That is good to know. I would suggest going with stainless steel mounting hardware just in case. (Which isn't a bad idea anyway) It bothers me when front license plate is screwed directly to the bumper.  Considering the cost of these mounting brackets, I wish manufacturers included them as standard equipment; it would show their attention to detail.When I found Cruiser Accessories 79150 Mounting Plate it seemed like a good value.  I especially liked multiple slots for mounting onto the bumper.  These slots provide a good number of mounting and adjustment options.  I used the upper two vertical slots because they were spaced exactly like the existing holes in my car's front bumper.Unfortunately, there was a couple of frustrating issues that spoiled the experience:1.  Four screws that are included with the plate are too long.  I saw them being long and I am glad I checked for this before installing the mounting plate onto the front bumper.  I used included four screws to attach the license plate and the Black Cruiser Accessories 20050 Classic Lite frame to the mounting plate - screws' sharp tips protruded 1/4" from the back of the mounting plate.  If I had installed the mounting plate onto the bumper first and then tried to attach the license plate with the included screws, I would have damaged the front bumper in two places (the bottom two holes ended up over an air intake slot on my car).  I expect all pieces included with the product to be carefully engineered for that product and working properly.  These screws, obviously, are of the wrong size.  The fact that I had to go to Home Depot to find properly fitting screws not only was frustrating, but also increased the overall cost.2.  The thin pieces of plastic at the top and bottom of the mounting plate are too flimsy.  When I unpacked the plate, these areas of the mounting plate were slightly deformed: bent inwards. Fortunately, the license plate covered the problem.When the mounting plate is installed, it looks nice, so I am not completely disappointed; however, I found a similar product from Bell at Autozone, and it was cheaper (though Bell's mounting plate had very long screws too). 
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. I put these in my '03 TJ Jeep Wrangler.  They fit perfect and work exactly as you'd expect they should.  I installed a set of 55w HIDs in them and the light output is tremendous. 
Sizes listed in reviews and the two in the description (15.8 x 10.5 x 5, and 12.5 x 9.5 x 7) don't match to what I received...The bag I received is in between what has been listed in the descriptions:  13.5" x 9" x 6" (empty).While seemingly a good quality bag, with a fair amount of straps and attached rain-cover (hidden in the heel of the bag), it seems the manufacturer (or seller) has no idea how to use a measuring tape!The bag itself is quite nice... good padding, rubberized bottom to prevent sliding, small pockets on either side, and zippers seem of reasonable quality.For the price and bag quality, I'm not complaining.  It works great on my CB750, and it does fit on the pillion of my VT1100c2 (without having to remove my rider backrest)  So if you have standard seating (or a touring/adventure style), this bag will do well for you as a pillion bag, and with a little strap adjustments, it also fits vertical on the front or back of a sissy-bar, or horizontal on a larger luggage rack... would recommend getting a  size  smaller than  what the  &#34;sizing chart&#34; recommends  as  I  measure aroun my leg  as  recommended  and  the chaps  were  one size too large.. otherwise they are  awesome  quality and build The 2 x 2 Inch mirrors are a good fit for 2006 Honda Pilot. I had to order via Amazon since I couldn't find these anywhere - it appears local auto stores only carry the 3 x 3 inch size. These little blind spot mirrors are a must buy item - they cover the blind spots on either side of the vehicle very well. 
The size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous. The funnel is 10" long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6" long. It states that the funnel is 4" x 4" but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2-1/4" in diameter at the widest point.It would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless. The meter has all the functions you could ask for a multimeter in a compact size.  The digits are large for the size of the meter, so it's easily readable by middle aged eyes.

these are a great additional tool for leveling the front and sides of the camper when you are by ourself! They are large enough to see from a distance to keep things on the level Screws are very soft and are easy to strip and not stainless.Plate is flimsy so think thoroughly about how to secure it best Fits on my Hi-Lift jack just fine. Does exactly what it is supposed to do.If you are using it on wheels that are deep make sure the straps are long enough to reach the spoke pattern. 
This is one-size-fits-most. It works on the filter for my 2002 Volkswagen Passat, but it's too large to grip the filter on my 1993 Chevrolet S10. Works great. Fairly easy swap.

This thing is pretty basic. You essentially create a girth hitch with it. You pass the strap around an object, then you take the standing part of the strap and grab a loop of it and pass it through the sewn loop at the tag end of the strap. Then you slide this thing between the standing part and the sewn loop, and when you tighten the strap, the bone prevents the standing part from sliding back through the sewn loop, essentially creating a knot. Any sailer will be familiar with this system it's used alot in quick release knots. This little gadget keeps my lift handle paired up nicely when mounted to my vehicle. It can get in the way when jacking, but it is easily solved by just pulling it up onto the d hook on the top. Clipped onto the doorlock and door latch rods securely and installed onto the inner door release handle nice and firm.  Worked perfectly. 
Fits perfectly for my 2003 Toyota Camry, but the number of folds in the filter were fewer than the OEM one. It's short 10 folds compared to the Toyota OEM cabin air filter. They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Works great. Fairly easy swap.

...fits my 1973 Chevy/GMC 4x4 steering wheel perfect. Stretch it over the wheel and wrap the vinyl string around it nice and tight. The vinyl will break so just stretch it a little. Fits my low clearance Mazda 5 that comes with alloy wheels and 3/4 inches of clearance between the inside of the tire and the suspension.  Have not tried it in the snow yet. Could a wheel chock chock is a wheel chock could chock wheels?In this case: 2.Good build quality, worked well on my AG tires on the rear of the tractor.

this actually works!!! the musty moldy a/c smell is entirely gone.  also the outside smell like bad exhaust gas smells less.. Does what it says it does......looks great ! Works great and has a pleasant citrus smell. But man does the mist burn your eyes. Made my interior look new and dried to a natural low shine. Did not attract dust or stay wet like other products. I will be buying more of this. 
It fits perfectly to my 2005 Honda Accord.Filter quality seems to be good. Exactly what was offered, fit nicely, no major prep work, won't fade or crack, adjusts perfectly, easy removal and fits under seat in truck bought this for my 2004 honda crv.  fit perfectly and cleared the code.  easy to do just give the threads some wd40

these work like a charm; the claimed &#34;best&#34; by a consumer publication is correct, these are the best wipers i have ever owned, easy install and great on the highway in heavy rain The best battery disconnect switch I have used. Very positive switch positions. Easy to install. You need a good electric drill - drilling into the steel frame on an RV can be a daunting task. great product for the money.  easy to install and looks/functions great!  just needed an impact wrench to secure it to the vehicle

These will not fit a 2014 Jeep Sahara Unlimited just in case anybody wanted to know.If by chance if you have a 2014 JKU you need a an oil filter. That number is a MOPAR 349.Our local Napa store could not bring up a part number for a new Jeep? bought this to use with a signal generator, and works great.  does just what I need.  will buy another if needed. just what i needed but got at a discount. ordered 5 of them to save time and to keep a stock of them. i have 2 cars that both use this filter so im sure they will be used up quickly and ill be ordering again!2007 grand prix 38002004 grand prix 3800SC

I have an old 55 GMC with a Napco 4wd on 37 inches tires and it stands pretty high. Even getting to the oil dip stick is a challenge without a step.That tire step is really great, it unfolds and installs in 2 seconds over the tire. It fits my 37x12.5 (it won't work with a bigger tire) and is pretty stable.It comes with a nice pouch with handles to carry it with you everywhere you go. It folds nicely and can be stored under your seat. A really great item, and I am considering buying a 2nd one so that I can have one on each side when I am working in the engine bay of the truck. I use it everyday primarily for a storage cover.  I have not had the cover on the bike in rain or weather.  I got the XL for my CBR500R with full large rear bags and windshield.  I can lock my helmet to the rear seat area put the cover on and it will cover up the entire bikes exhaust and 3/4 of the rear tire and entire front tire.  Two bungies mid bike and front tire enable hokking cover under bike.  Very sturdy and breathable with exhaust panels (silver durable material) and inner windshield liner.  Much bang for the buck. Would certainly purchase another if I had to without question. This wheel stop is great for keeping the RV trailer from rocking back and forward when walking around inside.  This is a must-have for travel trailers.  I bought two of these; one for each set of tires.  As one reviewer said, you may need to tighten them up a bit after a few days.  Measure the diameter of your tires first and the space between your tires before ordering.  This device comes in two sizes.  Built very sturdy and they are light in weight.  Need I say more.

Fits my low clearance Mazda 5 that comes with alloy wheels and 3/4 inches of clearance between the inside of the tire and the suspension.  Have not tried it in the snow yet. They only fit around a standard thickness roll bar not the newer jeep arrangement with the plastic cover shroud of the late models. I purchased this to be able to attach a high-end hydraulic assisted bike rake on the back of my Jeeps (JKs) with the rear tire still on.  It fit perfectly and teamed with the Bolt Lock BLT7018448 5/8'' Receiver Lock (Keyed specifically for your line of vehicle) it can be kept in the Jeep and my daughter doesn't need anything but her car key.The extender is exactly as advertised, well made, fit perfectly and does eactly what it is inteded for. 
Fits a little tight especially around the front fender and floorboards but it works.  I have a 03' Shadow ACE 750cc.  After a couple rain storms I can report my bike stayed dry (except a portion of the front wheel) and through heavy winds, the motorcycle cover stayed put.  What&#8217;s nice about this cover is the price and how it has elastic hooks to secure the cover in place.  If you decide to buy a cover and your bike has a windshield, floor boards and aftermarket mirrors I recommend you buy a 2XL (if your bike is similar in size to a Shadow 750cc).  Look at the picture I posted, mine has stock mirrors and no windshield and fits VERY tight.  My mirrors shift out of place when the cover is on.  Before each ride I have to adjust them cause the cover is soo tight.  Also, if you have floor boards that&#8217;ll make the fit even more tighter.  Buying one size bigger and I would say you bike will be 100% covered. I use it everyday primarily for a storage cover.  I have not had the cover on the bike in rain or weather.

Would certainly purchase another if I had to without question. This is very accurate and works well. The battery will last a long time and it fits easily in the glove box. They need to add a pin to the back side to let air out of the tire in case you over fill. 
For myself, these might work? Only because my car is very small and barely weighs 1800lbs. These are not solid, they are a thinner plastic, maybe 1/4 of an inch thick. They do however stack together nicely to make it easier to store them. I wouldn't recommend these to anyone, not even a Go-cart racer.When I seen RhinoGear I imagined thick sturdy rubber chock-blocks not thin plastic cups. These are really nice and heavy duty wheel chocks!  I bought these to go along with the Tri-Lynx 00015 Lynx Levelers, (Pack of 10) and they work perfectly!  The plastic is nice and thick and feels very sturdy.  I have no concerns of breaking these when I use my rubber mallet to hammer these in place.  Very nice! It's a dish drainer what more can you say.  The plastic is heavy-duty and it seems very well made.  Actually more sturdy that the Rubbermaid ones at Wal-Mart.  I bought this for the size and am well pleased. 
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. Fit my '98 Nissan Frontier's oil pan perfectly. Looks to be of nice quality.  Torque to 25ft/lbs (on the Frontier anyway) These item does fit perfect on my 2004 BMW x3. does what its suppose to do. so far so good thanks 
Great for a 3" wide receiver for Tacoma or Tundra. It can be hard to find a hitchpin that is for a wider/reinforced receiver. This works well with some small room to spare. Highly recommend. Sizes listed in reviews and the two in the description (15.8 x 10.5 x 5, and 12.5 x 9.5 x 7) don't match to what I received...The bag I received is in between what has been listed in the descriptions:  13.5" x 9" x 6" (empty).While seemingly a good quality bag, with a fair amount of straps and attached rain-cover (hidden in the heel of the bag), it seems the manufacturer (or seller) has no idea how to use a measuring tape!The bag itself is quite nice... good padding, rubberized bottom to prevent sliding, small pockets on either side, and zippers seem of reasonable quality.For the price and bag quality, I'm not complaining.  It works great on my CB750, and it does fit on the pillion of my VT1100c2 (without having to remove my rider backrest)  So if you have standard seating (or a touring/adventure style), this bag will do well for you as a pillion bag, and with a little strap adjustments, it also fits vertical on the front or back of a sissy-bar, or horizontal on a larger luggage rack... I bought two sets / 4 total. I use them near the middle of the lifting range which puts the saddle about 18 to 19 inches high. This is perfect to get my truck off the ground and give me an inch or so of ground clearance to R&R; the tires and do other work underneath the vehicle.I don't need 6t worth of lift, but I like how these j/s have a wide lifting range. With these set for my range (as stated above), they are not teetering at the top of the range like others I've used in the past, but are comfortably in the middle. They are very stable and solid units.It would be helpful if the info stated the lifting range of the units, not just the tonnage they can support as a pair.Min. Lift Height (in.)14 29/32Max. Lift Height (in.)23 1/2 
This product appears to include the cable. IT DOESN'T. It's just the mount which it does okay, but you'll have to buy the cable separately. The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around! As good as the factory original. Thanks for the tip from one of the other reviewers to drill a small hole in the top of the cap in order to attach the existing leash. (It doesn't come with one) 
one way check valve. Not a real big deal.Comes with 2 hoses and clamp as pictured. I think it even comes with a sticker. As good as the factory original. Thanks for the tip from one of the other reviewers to drill a small hole in the top of the cap in order to attach the existing leash. (It doesn't come with one) I should have gotten the Honda cap.  This fits OK, but the screws are not "captured" in the cap.  With the original cap,the screws cannot fall out.  Considering the position of the screws when mounting this, captured screws are an advantage. 
I bought these to change the tires on my GSXR. These tire irons are bigger than they appear to be. The description has them listed as small tire irons but the ones I received are 18 inches long from tip to tip and about 11.67mm thick (see pic). The thickness and the fact that these irons have a handle means you can place maximum pressure on them and they won't bend. The end has an s tip that gets under the tire and makes it easy to lift the tire over the rim. These are well made and will last a long time. these are a great additional tool for leveling the front and sides of the camper when you are by ourself! They are large enough to see from a distance to keep things on the level Sizes listed in reviews and the two in the description (15.8 x 10.5 x 5, and 12.5 x 9.5 x 7) don't match to what I received...The bag I received is in between what has been listed in the descriptions:  13.5" x 9" x 6" (empty).While seemingly a good quality bag, with a fair amount of straps and attached rain-cover (hidden in the heel of the bag), it seems the manufacturer (or seller) has no idea how to use a measuring tape!The bag itself is quite nice... good padding, rubberized bottom to prevent sliding, small pockets on either side, and zippers seem of reasonable quality.For the price and bag quality, I'm not complaining.

Does a super job on brass, copper, silver, aluminum, bronze and stainless steel. Polishes most metals to a mirror-like finish. I've been using this polish for many years and would definitely recommend it. Does a super job on brass, copper, silver, aluminum, bronze and stainless steel. Polishes most metals to a mirror-like finish. Very similar to Flitz polishing cream. These are typical hard plastic handles, contoured for grip. The stock bar is substantial at 7/16". Edges are finished nicely. The metal shaft is unpolished and has a finish to prevent slippage.I don't care if all my hand tools are the same color, if it matters to you then note these may come in a different color than illustrate (see my pics).Made in the U.S.A. - nice.j 
THIS IS A STURDY AND INEXPENSIVE LICENSE PLATE HOLDER THAT ALLOWS FOR THE PLATE TO SIT ON THE EDGE OF THE HOLDER BECAUSE OF IT'S DESIGN.  GOOD PRODUCT. Very quick and easy mounting and really adds to the look of the rear of the Jeep.  These are metal and not a cheap plastic and mount with included screws into the existing lens cover screw holes. This comes with 4 rubber feet that you install on the bottom.  Each foot is circular with a slot running from one side to the other that perfectly fits around the metal grate on top of RV stoves.  The board itself has pre-drilled pilot holes and a template that allows you to determine which holes to use for your particular stove.  It's a very well-done product.  The feet keep the unit in place during travel but it comes off easily when you want to use the stove.  The finish is very nice too so it looks excellent in place.  Highly recommend. 
It's a little to small to fit my license plate. Anyway I didn't want to take the time to send it back and look for another one so I made it fit mine I just used a pair of tin snips and trimmed off a small piece of the license plate along the bottom. It can't be seen since it's behind the frame. Works fine but I shouldn't have had to do anything so it's pretty bad when you can't make something to fit what it's supposed to fit. How hard would it be to measure a few different states license plates and make it big enough to fit the largest one? This strainer works, but can't fit even full size plates! It also is very flimsy. I would find another one! These Rugged Ridge 7/8 pin shackles are Heavy Duty! The threaded portion is 7/8 and the Pin shank is .991 I had to do just a little clearancing on my aftermarket bumper for these to work... no big deal, they look great and I`m sure they will perform well! The finish is very nice! 
Fit my '98 Nissan Frontier's oil pan perfectly. Looks to be of nice quality.  Torque to 25ft/lbs (on the Frontier anyway) 32mm is the correct size for my Jetta TDI oil cap, and this fits perfectly.It's also fairly low profile, another plus. Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. 
Perfect fit for rear window on my 2004 Ford Excursion Limited. Easy to install. No spotting seen or squeaking at all Even though Amazon says it does not fit my truck; it does fit my 2002 Chevrolet 2500HD crew cab with 6.0L gas engine. I replaced both sensors and harness. Both sensors were rough looking and the rear sensor had standing water on it. It was a little bit of a chore to get to them because you have to remove the intake but it was not too bad. They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. 
the bag it came with dosent fit it, if youve got it adjusted to the middle or top setting, this does exactley what they say, seems pretty rugged, it fits my duratrac 245/75/16s perfect and holds my 225lb self no prob. This cover fits my bike well and is very durable.  The generous size makes it easy to cover and remove, yet it has a snug fit as necessary to handle the wind.  Good product! Fit my '98 Nissan Frontier's oil pan perfectly. Looks to be of nice quality.  Torque to 25ft/lbs (on the Frontier anyway) 
Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. Perfect fit for rear window on my 2004 Ford Excursion Limited. Easy to install. No spotting seen or squeaking at all I purchased this belt for my 2003 Chevy Tahoe. I had no idea Chevy would put 2 serpentines on a newer generation vehicle. This smaller belt fits the A/C system only. It works like a champ and fits perfectly. I would recommend the Gatorback belts to EVERYONE! As an installation side note, you have to remove the air intake and larger serpentine to get to this "bottom of the motor" mounted unit.... way to engineer that one GM!

I tried to be careful, so I enter my car information. Amazon fit checks show that it would fit 1996 Lexus LS400. I ordered and found out it didn't fit. My car has an arm that requires the thin side but this wiper blade is too big to fit. Can't complain; it works perfectly and as advertised however, i should have done my homework.  it doesn't fit my rear disk... it only fits the front. Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. 
I have previously used in: 1980 Honda CX500C to fix a rough idle, 2000 Suzuki SV650 to stabilize fuel, and a 2005 Chevy Cobalt to fix a problem with stalling at idle. fits my car perfectly, works perfectly, was easy to install. The best measure of a wiper blade is that it does what it is supposed to do, when it is supposed to do it. The tool appears to be of average quality.  However, I returned it to Amazon since it did not fit up to a Ford Taurus flex fuel engine.  This type of engine requires a special fitting that this tool does not have. 
The meter has all the functions you could ask for a multimeter in a compact size.  The digits are large for the size of the meter, so it's easily readable by middle aged eyes. Hella Replacement.  Kinda.  Mine came with BLUE wire.. they should always be white. Its also not covered in fabric and the white ones are. Works ok, but is smaller size than the blue  ones offered here on Amazon. Due to the size difference the Blue ones are a much better value. 
I ordered one of these for my 2008 Saturn Vue. Package marked for 2008 Vue but item did not work. Contacted storefront who fullfilled order for Amazon and was referred to Curt mfg. to obtain return number. Then had to contact seller again. Got a refund but I purchased a replacement from a local dealer. Seller later reported a wrong item number was somehow in the package. you can buy this for the same price at the store, but with amazon i had it shipped to the comfort of my own office. That aside this fixed my maf sensor and the trouble codes it was producing. Replaced the wipers on my girlfriend's 2006 Ford Fusion. OEM, especially Ford specified, sucked hardcore, so these were a major upgrade. No streaks, no tear drops, and gets everything with one swipe!As always, Amazon had the best price online. Plus my Amazon Prime 2-Day shipping? Paid for itself! 
Matched my car's color perfectly!  I  don't know what else to say but there is a word count requirement for the review... While the product applies to the purpose it serves, the packaging is very misleading. Don't judge it by the capacity of its bottle size because the content is only half the dimension of the bottle. It leaves the person scratching his/her head wondering if the volume within is half-empty or half-full. It goes by weight, but then why use such a large bottle (besides it is unsealed) giving the impression that you get a good deal based on the volume. I know the review should only be for the product, but the packaging Is very misleading. .You're going to waste money on gas unless maintaining your tire pressure is real fast and easy. This unit makes it real fast and easy.I used a mechanical pencil gauge for years. This is faster and easier.PROs:* Reads easily in bright sun or in darkness* Accuracy to nearest half pound* Easy to line-up with valve stem (avoid air spillage).- Warranty: 5 years- User guide is clear and complete (specs, tips, troubleshooting, warranty details...)OKs:- Lightweight (1.9 oz)- Rubberized handle- Accuracy: Not sure. It reads 1 PSI lower than my old pencil gauge. But the two Accutire MS-4021B's I bought agree with one another.CONs:- None so far.- - - Battery Note - - -The 3 batteries need replacement after about 1800 readings, according to the user guide.

Bought them with the cruiser plates and while they did fit the plates they did not fit the wholes on the car. Dont know why. Work fine on the front but not the rear. Also they are security screws, so do not lose the device that comes with them. FYI I purchased this to be able to attach a high-end hydraulic assisted bike rake on the back of my Jeeps (JKs) with the rear tire still on.  It fit perfectly and teamed with the Bolt Lock BLT7018448 5/8'' Receiver Lock (Keyed specifically for your line of vehicle) it can be kept in the Jeep and my daughter doesn't need anything but her car key.The extender is exactly as advertised, well made, fit perfectly and does eactly what it is inteded for. 
I welded a piece of flat stock on the insert for the motorhome. This adapter is for my Dodge Grand Caravan. They only fit around a standard thickness roll bar not the newer jeep arrangement with the plastic cover shroud of the late models. It locks and unlocks well with a &#34;positive&#34; engagement feel when it is secure. Fits great for both my front bumper receiver and rear receiver on my 2005 Dodge Ram.  No complaints, and I'd definitely buy it again.

The &#34;feet&#34; on this bar slides off the truck bed sides and makes it worthless.When the ratchet is extended, the mechanism for that ends up out of arms reach when standing outside the truck. The install is easy, just level your camper using a carpenter level of 3 feet or longer.  Set the level from side-to-side on your smooth flooring or counter top. Then set the level from front-to-back the same way on the smooth flooring or counter top.  Now position the Hopkins 08525 levels, one on the side you prefer to work from at the front of the camper, on a flat vertical surface.  Do the same on a side wall near the front corner on a smooth vertical surface.  Use the double stick tape to position, but consider adding pop rivets or small screws to hold the setting for many years.  Holes are provided in the Hopkins levels.Use the front level first to drive onto leveling ramps or boards, then use the side level along with the tongue jack to finish (after you unhitch). Extend your stabilizer jacks and you're set for level comfortable sleeping in your camper. These scrapers always break at the smallest part of the handle right behind the head. I heated up a length of 3/4 PVC conduit and slid it over the entire handle,allowing it to spread out slightly at the scraper head. Works like a charm, and now it's long enough to reach the center of my truck windshield! 
Works great on my 2012 Wrangler Sport. Heavy duty rubber that fits well in my hitch receiver and looks like it will last awhile. Fits my Big Electra Glide, nice bag, well made double stiched good for the value and folds up small nice VERY sturdy, probably too sturdy for me lol. I have a 2011 Coleman Sun Valley pop up camper and its a little big to fit in my tow bag. All in all a great product.

Easy to install. No spotting seen or squeaking at all Perfect for exhaust work.  I bought it for a catalytic converter and o2 sensor project because it is rated for: -30F to 1800F 
I put these in my '03 TJ Jeep Wrangler.  They fit perfect and work exactly as you'd expect they should.  I installed a set of 55w HIDs in them and the light output is tremendous. They do work.

strong.installs in seconds.simple design.looks great.back seat passengers use them ALL THE TIME.i have the overhead handles by rugged ridge on the roll bars and i got these to supplement those,but these are actually used more by folks in the back seat.they fit my 2012 jk wrangler perfectly but will work on any vehicle that has the two metal posts on the head rests.(as long as you can remove the headrest)it literally took me 60 seconds to install both of these into my jeep.def recommend these to any one who ones a 4 door jeep.good price.will last for years to come.

It is rare for the same vehcle to change a design like that. It, in fact, fits perfectly. Our RV gas filler has no cover (not that that is a deterrant) and 60 gallons is a target for remote theft of gas, or a target for vandalism. This cap fits well. I have not been able to fit the stock cap-retainer onto it yet. I understand these modern vehicles have anti siphon plugs but one can still end up with foreign substances in the exposed fill-tube. This is a good 'ounce of prevention'.Highly recommended. 
Perfect fit on my 2012 Jeep Wrangler, have been a K&N fan for years and have them on all of my vehicles. Great product!!! This is a solid, versatile lock that will fit Class II, Class III and Class IV hitch receivers.  Mine came with two hardened-steel chrome plated pins (not a sleeve as was illustrated when I bought it).  The smaller pin works with Class II and Class III hitch receivers.  The larger pin works with Class IV.  I use this lock to secure my bike rack and it's tough enough that I wouldn't want to lose my keys.  The keyhole is protected by a weather-resistant rubber cover, yet rotates for easy accessibility.  This is a rugged, versatile hitch lock offered at a good price. I have been a fan of the Rain X blades, The latitude are new to me as I have always used the standard ones.  These work even better, they fit perfectly on my Audi that uses some new style clip, i was suprised that Rain X provided the additional clip to fit this application. 
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. Exact replacement from OEM. Exact fit worked perfect . Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs. Great Fit 
Even though Amazon says it does not fit my truck; it does fit my 2002 Chevrolet 2500HD crew cab with 6.0L gas engine. I replaced both sensors and harness. Both sensors were rough looking and the rear sensor had standing water on it. It was a little bit of a chore to get to them because you have to remove the intake but it was not too bad. Very well made unit, fits my Ford F150 and my Ram 2500 , Grease the snot out of it inside and out and install. The cover is a bit cheap but seems to work well. Double Double Check that you have the locking end on correctly, Just play with it before use and you will master it. Perfect fit for rear window on my 2004 Ford Excursion Limited. Easy to install. No spotting seen or squeaking at all 
I have used these jack stands with my BMW E46 convertible and E90 sedan.  The stands are nicely finished, light weight, and durable.  For safety reasons, I will only use jack stands with a locking pin, and these fit the bill.  (I also like to put a tire/wheel under the car as backup)  Recommended. I have one of these jacks supporting the rear of my trailer in the driveway, it is rock steady even with four people in the trailer. I like it that these are light weight (steel jack stands can be quite heavy) and I like that these come apart easily and stack up into a compact set for storage.As far as using these for camping: hmmm. They are really too short for my camper, so I'll need to haul 2x6 pieces around to raise them up. Also, the head (the piece that touches the frame of the trailer) doesn't swivel well under load and can pop off of the frame while you are raising the stand. And the steel parts (the nut and the screw) aren't galvanized so they rust. I have a 2011 Jeep Wrangler 2 door Rubicon and I installed the red velcro grab handles on the front roll bars, the red rear pillar grab handles in the back, and just installed the black grab handles to the windshield pillar.  All three of the options are great and serve a different purpose.  The handles are heavy duty, so it would take a lot to tear one of them.  I really like the red handles because they &#34;pop&#34; when you get in the Jeep, but I opted for the black handles for the front windshield so that it wasn't distracting while I was driving. 
Very small cars only. SUV or truck or large car tires do not fit well between the ridges and deform the product. I fastened the mat down with 4 tapcon concrete screws, each 2 inches long, into my garage slab. The leading edge of the mat tore off the screws and folded up. The adhesive strip behind the mat was also useless. I would have had better result with a 2 x 4 piece of fir or pine and concrete screwing it to the garage slab. You also have to aim the car perfectly when you park it because the mat is only as wide as the tire. I can't return it because it's damaged from use due to faulty design. Wasted my money. CAVEAT: I have a front-wheel drive car, and I *back* into my garage.  The parking mat goes under my rear (un-driven) wheels.  Perhaps that makes my experience different from some of the others.I found about this product from a show on Speed Channel that was talking about garage products.  The host said the big benefit of this mat was that your tire rolled onto the front part of the mat first, holding it down, before it rolled it over the hump.  Thus, this mat didn't need to be fixed to your garage floor.  That's what I wanted: something that didn't need to be permanently attached to the floor.  The guy on TV didn't even mention that it came with tape.I did put a little masking tape on the garage floor to mark where I typically position the mat, so I can remove it (to sweep or whatever) and replace it right back where it goes as needed.  I don't use the adhesive tape it comes with to adhere it to the floor.  In my case, it works perfectly, just like the guys on Speed Channel described.  I've used it for a little over a month now, and my mat simply doesn't move.  (Ok, maybe it moves some ridiculously trivial amount, but for all intents and purposes, it has stayed put for a month.)  If the mat is going under your driven wheels or steering wheels, I can understand how it might move around.Others have complained that the mat is too narrow.  I wouldn't complain if they made it a little wider, but I don't have much trouble hitting it as it is. Fits a little tight especially around the front fender and floorboards but it works.  I have a 03' Shadow ACE 750cc.  After a couple rain storms I can report my bike stayed dry (except a portion of the front wheel) and through heavy winds, the motorcycle cover stayed put.  What&#8217;s nice about this cover is the price and how it has elastic hooks to secure the cover in place.  If you decide to buy a cover and your bike has a windshield, floor boards and aftermarket mirrors I recommend you buy a 2XL (if your bike is similar in size to a Shadow 750cc).  Look at the picture I posted, mine has stock mirrors and no windshield and fits VERY tight.  My mirrors shift out of place when the cover is on.  Before each ride I have to adjust them cause the cover is soo tight.  Also, if you have floor boards that&#8217;ll make the fit even more tighter.  Buying one size bigger and I would say you bike will be 100% covered. 
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. This fits nicely into my boat's HVAC system.  The original one was NASTY!  Hire a contortionist to install it for you. bought this to take the o2 sensor off my 2004 honda crv.  worked great.  long enough and fit like a glove. 
This works great. It's sturdy and fit's nice and snug in a standard 5 gallon bucket. I will be ordering more of these in the future. I use these to cover my original Honda floor mats.  I had to trim an area in the left upper corner so it would fit, but after doing that, it does the trick.  Granted, these are not top quality, but I only wanted something to protect my good carpet floormats.  For $13.50, you can't beat it.  I would highly recommend. Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. 
I've read other reviews where some say that this does not stay in place.  I installed two in my garage, one on each side, for both my vehicles. After marking the optimum spot on my garage floor where I wanted my vehicles to be clearance-wise, I cleaned the floor to remove any/all dirt and grease.  Then, since my floor was pretty cold because it is still winter here in Colorado, I used my creme brulee torch to heat up the concrete so that the tape would bond with the floor better. After placing the parking stop on the floor, I parked my car on top of it over night.  This step might have been overkill, but I wanted to make sure the tape made good contact and bond with the floor.  After over a month of use, both stops are still in place and we are pleased that we can park our vehicles in the same place every time. In summary, take care to find the optimum place to install on your garage floor, prep the floor properly, and this parking stop will work great. I bought a set of these ramps and they flat out don't work on my 2010 Dodge Ram 1500 4x2.  In my garage and/or on an asphalt parking lot they don't stay put.  When I drive up them they slide forward and my truck just scoots them along.  I have to "hold" them in place by using rubber floor mats and/or wood stoppers.  Yes, they have the rubber feet on their base but they don't hold.  Hate them....and wouldn't buy them again.  I returned them. Very small cars only. SUV or truck or large car tires do not fit well between the ridges and deform the product. I fastened the mat down with 4 tapcon concrete screws, each 2 inches long, into my garage slab.

What's to say?  It's not very large.  It works perfect in my 2003 Chevy truck to add a Fuel Additive into the fuel tank!!!  It should work for Power steering and transmission also, at least on Car/trucks that's not hard to get to or down load were access is bad.  The design helps keep you from spilling when your poring a fluid into it!  For under $5, not a bad deal.  Hang it up out of the way when done with it.  It's able to fit into your Transmission Dip Stick tube, so it has to be small enough, so you can just dump a bunch a fluid into it at once!!!  It's small and doesn't hold all that much.  For what it is, I like it. This worked great for pumping the &#34;Purple&#34; stuff into my rear differential for my Ford F150.  I also dumped the friction modifier into the partially emptied quart bottle and pumped that into the differential. handy. when you go to dump, connect the sewer hose to the dump and then hold the end under the cap. Slowly loosen the gardern hose cap. If either of your blade valves has leaked or been opened you will have some &#34;water&#34; here and you will catch it and drain it into your sewer hose instead of all over the ground in front of everyone at the dump station. Can also be used for backflushing if you're careful and use backflow preventer. 
Had planned to drop these behind the wheels on the truck when we put the boat over.But they want to slip on the concrete ramp as soon as the tire tread starts to push.Doesn't seem to matter whether I plant them before easing the tires back, or hard-place them at the tires, because as soon as enough drift happens, the tire and chock move together. I bought a set of these ramps and they flat out don't work on my 2010 Dodge Ram 1500 4x2.  In my garage and/or on an asphalt parking lot they don't stay put.

Yes, they have the rubber feet on their base but they don't hold.  Hate them....and wouldn't buy them again.  I returned them. These are awesome for the times when you have to put some leveling blocks under the tires on one side of your RV. In the past I wasn't really able to chalk that side of the camper once on leveling blocks. With this I can. It also helps keep the RV from rolling moving around when you are inside. Highly recommended.

They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!! Works great. Fairly easy swap.

I bought this steering wheel cover to hide the peeling leather on my 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited steering wheel. I measured the inside dimensions of the wheel, 15". I did not have to heat or stretch the new wheel cover, it fit perfectly and looks great. It's also much easier to keep clean with interior protectant. I welded a piece of flat stock on the insert for the motorhome. This adapter is for my Dodge Grand Caravan. I use it everyday primarily for a storage cover.  I have not had the cover on the bike in rain or weather.  I got the XL for my CBR500R with full large rear bags and windshield.  I can lock my helmet to the rear seat area put the cover on and it will cover up the entire bikes exhaust and 3/4 of the rear tire and entire front tire.  Two bungies mid bike and front tire enable hokking cover under bike.  Very sturdy and breathable with exhaust panels (silver durable material) and inner windshield liner.  Much bang for the buck. Would certainly purchase another if I had to without question. 
Its a tire gauge that is pretty basic to use. You insert the metal pin into the tire tread gap and the rear part tells you the depth. Walk around the vehicle and check all the tires. If the front tires are worn more than the rear, its time to rotate the front tires to the rear. I use it everyday primarily for a storage cover.

It also tended to &#34;ride up&#34; the window and not keep the wipers covered. 
Perfect fit on my 2012 Jeep Wrangler, have been a K&N fan for years and have them on all of my vehicles. Great product!!! Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!! Bought as a replacement for a stock one in my plow truck.  I like this one.  Size is perfect and the mirror is good quality. 
If you work on peoples stuff you know what a pain in the rear trailer wiring is, always non-functional.  this conncetor works and holds the flat 4 wire firmly. Bought them with the cruiser plates and while they did fit the plates they did not fit the wholes on the car. Dont know why. Work fine on the front but not the rear. Also they are security screws, so do not lose the device that comes with them. FYI Looks great, easy install, will help back passengers when top is down, since there is nothing to hold on too, low profile, does not get in the way of view. (Jeep Wrangler 2013 2 door)

Ok so I figured I would write a review since these seem to be new to amazon and they had prime shipping so I went for them.Firstly these are ATO fuses.  The description doesn't say it anywhere for some odd reason however they also sell a mini fuse set which is labeled correctly and the picture shows ATO fuses.  Anyways, the fuses came in a box that is actually pretty nice and latches properly shut.  Label says 1 year warranty although their fuses so shouldn't have a problem.  On the other side of the boxes label is a chart showing Tan = 5amp, Red = 10amp, Blue = 15amp, Yellow = 20amp, Clear = 25amp, Green = 30amp.The fuses themselves seem to be very nice quality and have the number on them printed clearly however it is the plastic color and not painted white.  Note that the link that connects the two ends is horse shoe shaped rather than zigzagged which is something I personally have never seen before.At ~$10 it was a great price for 120 fuses + an actual working container. I did not carefully read reviews before placed my order.  Few buyer pointed out the product feature has changed.  According ad photo, It suppose has green and red indicator lights but only comes with one single red light, green light feature is omitted.  Red light means AC power is on but no way to tell it is actually charging or not?  For only one red light version, you can pay less than half price from other seller for similar product at Amazon. I would say the claim of 51 watts equaling 115 watts is just not true! Based on the claim I figured these bulbs would just blow away my Sylvania Ultra Stars. Put the PIAA in one light and compared to the Sylvannia left in the other. Against my white garage door, I saw no visible difference in light output at all! Drove the truck and no difference. Color is only a very slightly different shade of white. I am not knocking PIAA as I know they do make quality products, but the claim is misleading. 
Fits my low clearance Mazda 5 that comes with alloy wheels and 3/4 inches of clearance between the inside of the tire and the suspension.  Have not tried it in the snow yet. Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend. I use it everyday primarily for a storage cover.  I have not had the cover on the bike in rain or weather.  I got the XL for my CBR500R with full large rear bags and windshield.

Great cover! I put it on in minutes after delivery and warming a little, and it is not moving; low 80's outside today but likely over 110F in the car. I do not have sweaty hands and it does not look like color came off. It is smooth leather and is dyed black, much like belts and shoes, which can rub off on contact (belts do after repeated hand-contact and probably stain the inside of belt loops without our knowing). For those with sweaty hands get a rubber-cover with grips (stinky) or vinyl (slippery) but neither are very durable in hot cars; you won't be as happy with the comfort unless it is leather. Non-leather will smell toxic or be slippery, but it will not bleed color. If your hands sweat they may slip on vinyl or smooth rubber. This product has a great grip and feel and leathery smell.There is an inner rubber-sleeve )non-smelly) that prevents the cover from moving. I set the product in the sun for about 5 minutes and it made it ply-able enough to work it on. I recommend starting with the center-most seam on top of a straight wheel(there are 3 seams at roughly 12,4,8 O'clock), carefully work the outer edge over the wheel and down both sides evenly (the first 3/4's is easy), use patience and care, then roll the edge into position. If it is off-center it cannot be slid sideways. Take it off carefully and begin again with it more centered and work each side evenly; a little here, a little there. Do not put this on cold or stretch without warming; it can damage/crack/tear cold leather.I placed this on a 15" 2008 Chevy Aveo5 steering wheel (do measure your wheel diameter before ordering). The only con to these types of covers is they cannot wrap the inside, so the fingers feel the outer edges of the cover; in this case it is smooth, rolled, and well stitched and I have gotten used to it. It is probably made in China at this price but it looks and feels like good quality. I recommend this and would choose to buy again and recommend to a friend. I also recommend a little leather conditioner on this, much like one would use on leather car interiors. It is smooth leather, not suade or roughened.In 'the old days' I bought wrapped 'stinky' vinyl, and used vinyl to thread through holes and wrap around the cover with tension (still available) and it filled the inner part of the wheel. It was difficult and time-consuming, and, the vinyl strings eventually breaks. I recommend this 'new and improved' version. Rubber and vinyl degrades in heat and UV. Did you know that wonderful 'new car smell' is highly carcinogenic, expecially when hot, and all the glue they use on carpeting and interior fabric, also. This has been well known and accepted for over 50 years but it sells cars. FYI. MALLORY 532 26&#34; SNOW BRUSH WITH FOAM GRIP (COLOURS  MAY VARY)MALLORY USA,HELPS  SCRAPE SNOW OFF OF YOUR VEHICLE DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS ,AND HELPS KEEP YOUR WINDSHIELD AND OTHER GLASS CLEAN I bought these so I could have extra, whats in the truck sometime break because of weather very hot or freezing cold when they are old. 
I found that it was hard to find this color.  I have used this product line for other cars.  The match has always been perfect. I like the bright orange color. As other reviewer pointed out, it only comes in as a pair, not four. You can find a cheaper ones at Walmart. First, as with all of the Dupli-Color Metalcast paints, if you want the metalcast effect, you'll have to use the Dupli-Color Metalcast Ground Coat (MC100) on the surface before you apply the color or it will not come out right. The can says that it also comes out the same if you're painting directly onto chrome like surface but I have not tried this so I don't know. Now for this green. I'm more of a blue and purple guy for dark colors so only by my personal preference do I say that this green comes out just a tad light in color for me. Overall though, if you use the ground coat this comes out great with a nice metal sheen. I recommend this product. 
Hella Replacement.  Kinda.  Mine came with BLUE wire.. they should always be white. Its also not covered in fabric and the white ones are. These are a good accessory to have because the clips are decent quality and the varied colors are helpful in keeping track of all the wires. please note these are not white - but beige... other than that they are standard rv baggage catches 
These work well for a budget level. They have double sided tape on the back and a couple of drill holes for security. The problem is that if you only use the tape they can move simply by grabbing them and wiggling them around. The onyl way to truly secure them is to drill holes. I did not want to drill holes in my RV in the event that I didn't like these or wanted to go with something else in the future.If you do get them I would buy a couple packs of them so that if they break or go bad you can put a new one in without chancing them being unavilable and potentially having to get something else that doesn't have the same screw hole pattern. I bought a set of these ramps and they flat out don't work on my 2010 Dodge Ram 1500 4x2.  In my garage and/or on an asphalt parking lot they don't stay put.  When I drive up them they slide forward and my truck just scoots them along.  I have to "hold" them in place by using rubber floor mats and/or wood stoppers.  Yes, they have the rubber feet on their base but they don't hold.  Hate them....and wouldn't buy them again.  I returned them. I got my rv level and checked it using bubble levelers in several locations. Once it was for sure completely level I put these on the front by my electric tounge jack where I can see them when I am leveling the trailer. one is positioned for the side to side level and one is positioned for the up and down front and back level.They work great. I cleaned the area really good with alcohol and used the adhesive backers they came with.You can drill holes and screw them on but I do not like drilling holes if I do not have to.They have been on there for some time now and if they start coming off I will just get some 3m command strips or just get new ones since they are not that expensive.

Hella Replacement.  Kinda.  Mine came with BLUE wire.. they should always be white. Its also not covered in fabric and the white ones are. I use this product on the car's leather seats. The seats are a tan color and really show dirt and stains. This product cleans them up nice. This product leaves a nice smooth feel & shine. The price is right too. It applies easily, and works well on dark or light colors.

This is one-size-fits-most. It works on the filter for my 2002 Volkswagen Passat, but it's too large to grip the filter on my 1993 Chevrolet S10. This sunshade is easy to use and folds up to a nice compact size that fits under my seat well. It's a quite large size so is made for an SUV or car that has a large windshield like my Toyota Prius. While it doesn't fit the Prius perfectly, it's the closest size to being perfect.At this price, I have no complaints with this and can recommend it. the bag it came with dosent fit it, if youve got it adjusted to the middle or top setting, this does exactley what they say, seems pretty rugged, it fits my duratrac 245/75/16s perfect and holds my 225lb self no prob. 
Inexpensive, yet works as good as the ones sold by Honda dealerships. Made true to specs and fits right into the slot on my Accord 2006.Will buy again. Exact replacement from OEM. Exact fit worked perfect . Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs. Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars 
Fits my low clearance Mazda 5 that comes with alloy wheels and 3/4 inches of clearance between the inside of the tire and the suspension.  Have not tried it in the snow yet. I use it everyday primarily for a storage cover.  I have not had the cover on the bike in rain or weather.  I got the XL for my CBR500R with full large rear bags and windshield.  I can lock my helmet to the rear seat area put the cover on and it will cover up the entire bikes exhaust and 3/4 of the rear tire and entire front tire.  Two bungies mid bike and front tire enable hokking cover under bike.  Very sturdy and breathable with exhaust panels (silver durable material) and inner windshield liner.  Much bang for the buck. Would certainly purchase another if I had to without question. They only fit around a standard thickness roll bar not the newer jeep arrangement with the plastic cover shroud of the late models. 
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. I have an old 55 GMC with a Napco 4wd on 37 inches tires and it stands pretty high. Even getting to the oil dip stick is a challenge without a step.That tire step is really great, it unfolds and installs in 2 seconds over the tire. It fits my 37x12.5 (it won't work with a bigger tire) and is pretty stable.It comes with a nice pouch with handles to carry it with you everywhere you go. It folds nicely and can be stored under your seat. A really great item, and I am considering buying a 2nd one so that I can have one on each side when I am working in the engine bay of the truck. I purchased this because it fits in the same bag that I keep my trailer ball mount in. This way I always have a lug wrench with me in case I get a flat tire on my trailer. It's a nice quality tool and one of the sockets fits my trailer lugs. Very happy with this purchase and I would recommend it if you're looking for a space-saving way of carrying around a lug wrench. 
I like the Camco brand.  The nice thing about the Sidewinder is that you can snap and unsnap parts of it to change the length.  It comes with a handle that most of us probably toss away with the box.  The handle takes up too much room and is not worth the bother when preparing to move.  Who wants to wrap your arms around a muddy sewer hose holder to wrestle the handle back on?  I just tuck the holder into a bag for the move. Good extension wire to use when you need a little bit more room. I use this on my ATV for the batt charger since I put a basket on it. Don't have to crawl under to hook it up. Gotta have a tow strap on your Rzr or ATV.  Not having one is just plain silly.  This one fit the bill.  I'm not a big fan of forged hooks on tow straps.  But for my use I think it will be fine as my Rzrs don't weigh over 1000lbs.  The strap material is nice and heavy.  The 20ft length is nice to have too.  I used it the other day to pull my Rzr out of a mud bog.  No issues what so ever.  I hit it with a power sprayer to get the mud off and allowed it to dry.  I then rolled it up and put it back on the Rzr ready for our next outing.  Good inexpensive strap. 
Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. This is one-size-fits-most. It works on the filter for my 2002 Volkswagen Passat, but it's too large to grip the filter on my 1993 Chevrolet S10.

I needed a cover for my bike that I park outside, this cover is made to cover your bike inside to keep the dust off. very thin don't think it would make it a full year outside so I got a heavy duty one. I use this one for a dust cover on my tool box. Looked at these before, but always thought they were rather pricey.  However, they are quite well made.  Design allows for the supplied hitch pins to be secured on the inside of the locking compartment, so no one can just disconnect this vault from your receiver hitch.  All seams where dirt and moisture could seep in are covered by foam rubber gaskets, so I am hopeful they work as designed!  Heavy duty, and I have had to use it once already to let myself in!  All in all, although pricey, worth the buy and the peace of mind! This rotor seems OK, but the original is held in place by a screw that is under a plastic dust cover.  So, how do I remove the rotor?

It folds nicely and can be stored under your seat. A really great item, and I am considering buying a 2nd one so that I can have one on each side when I am working in the engine bay of the truck. These are the perfect size for the tires on an rv trailer - 15&#34;. I had some that were too large and didn't fit the curve of the tire so weren't very effective. These fit perfectly and hold extremely well. If you put a loop of rope through the hole, it makes it easier to remove them from under your tires. CONS: This bag is very snug and somewhat difficult to fit my helmet into. But I will also mention that I wear a XL ICON Domain II helmet that has a little spoiler kind of hanging off the top of the helmet. Does not have enough room to store an extra shield.PROS: Made very well and offers a good degree of protection without being too bulky. The price was very good.SUMMARY: Would I buy this bag again? Yes. I like a bag that does not take up a lot of space, has a snug fit and does what it is suppose to do. This bag fits my needs perfectly. Even if it would hold an extra shield I would probably not store one inside for fear it may become scratched or damaged in some way. Shields are too expensive to be messed with too much when not attached to a helmet. I keep my extra shields in my closet in a box designed for that.

This worked perfectly for my 2003 Ford Excursion.  It fit right over the tire and gave me the extra height I wanted to load bikes on the roof and a car top carrier.  Seems very sturdy and well made.  The bag that comes with it is a nice bonus feature.  I see what others have mentioned though about the adjustable step and folding it up in the bag.  If you place the step in any position except for the lowest, you will not be able to store it in the bag folded.  All that said, it will still fold up in that position and you could easily put a bunge around it and store it that way. There are 2 part numbers out there for this product.... I have 15&#34; wheels on my 5th wheel so I ordered the larger one... I tried this out just for fit and I think this will work perfectly to secure wheels when one side is up on leveling blocks and can't be chocked. 
I purchased this to be able to attach a high-end hydraulic assisted bike rake on the back of my Jeeps (JKs) with the rear tire still on.  It fit perfectly and teamed with the Bolt Lock BLT7018448 5/8'' Receiver Lock (Keyed specifically for your line of vehicle) it can be kept in the Jeep and my daughter doesn't need anything but her car key.The extender is exactly as advertised, well made, fit perfectly and does eactly what it is inteded for. I bought this steering wheel cover to hide the peeling leather on my 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited steering wheel. I measured the inside dimensions of the wheel, 15". I did not have to heat or stretch the new wheel cover, it fit perfectly and looks great. It's also much easier to keep clean with interior protectant. It's a great product, however, it would not fit my Honda Shadow VT750 disc brake.It supposedly has 10mm holes in the disc brake, but for some reason the pin just won't fit!Otherwise it looks like a good product!I've used the 5mm pin for my scooters; however my motorcycle now has to do without lock. 
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Works great. Fairly easy swap.

Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!! 
just  recived  these  prefect  fit would  tell any one in of these  to buy  these you  wont  besorry  you did It say's that it doesn't fit on my 04 Crown Vic but, it does :) Just to let people know!

Evidently these are meant for use on cars ONLY. They are too small to fit the coil springs on my '11 Silverado. Otherwise I guess they are decent spring compressors. A good Made in USA chock.  It may cost about a buck less each at Walmart, if you can find it.There is a hole in the side for a rope to hold one or two together for each side of the tire.  Don't buy the one with a rope. It costs twice as much for the same one chock, NOT two.The heavy rubber  Buyers Rubber Wheel Chock - 5in.W, Model# WC1467A  at $8.99 each at Northern Tools are heavier and provides a better grip on concrete, but they are heavy to carry around.  I use the Buyers' ones in the garage and carry the Camco ones in my trunk.Also NOTE that the Buyer's ones are made in the same place as the expensive Race Ramps Branded ones costing 50% more.  The Buyers ones are nearly identical, are exactly the same size and weight.  The Race Ramps ones have shallow slits cut into the bottom. They are a bit slick and need to be sand blasted or something. I would not buy these for any Tire size 15 inch or smaller. Get a 4x4 , cut it, use it. 
When I ordered this, I was guaranteed fitment on a Toyota 3S-FE engine. When it arrived, it was not the correct size. i left two stars because I did run out and buy the correct size from another store, however, I didnt want to have to do this when I had all the rest of my parts shipped in. I have purchased two sets of these wheel chocks, to be certain I'll always have a set in the car I'm driving.  Undoubtedly will be purchasing more!  They nest for easier packing, aand they are very light weight, yet very strong. They work just great for what I want.  I have two sets of them that I use on my travel trailer.  Will buy two more sets when the others that I use wear out. 
The meter has all the functions you could ask for a multimeter in a compact size.  The digits are large for the size of the meter, so it's easily readable by middle aged eyes. The size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous. The funnel is 10" long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6" long. It states that the funnel is 4" x 4" but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2-1/4" in diameter at the widest point.It would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless. This sunshade is easy to use and folds up to a nice compact size that fits under my seat well. It's a quite large size so is made for an SUV or car that has a large windshield like my Toyota Prius. While it doesn't fit the Prius perfectly, it's the closest size to being perfect.At this price, I have no complaints with this and can recommend it. 
Even though Amazon says it does not fit my truck; it does fit my 2002 Chevrolet 2500HD crew cab with 6.0L gas engine. I replaced both sensors and harness. Both sensors were rough looking and the rear sensor had standing water on it. It was a little bit of a chore to get to them because you have to remove the intake but it was not too bad. The drop on this hitch is exactly what I needed for my Dodge Ram.  It makes hooking up my trailer a breeze. I bought this wheel chock to prevent my truck from slipping down an icy roadway during freezing weather at my mountain cabin.  I have to park on the road above my cabin during inclement weather because my driveway is too iced up to drive on.  This roadway has an incline and in the past,  my truck slid backwards on the ice after putting the truck in park and setting the parking brake.  I put this wheel chock behind the rear tire and it keeps my truck from sliding on the ice.  The nice thing about the strap on the wheel is the wheel chock usually freezes to the road during the night and I can pull it loose when I need to remove the chock.This chock is expensive, but worth the extra expense and I am going to order another one so both wheels are chocked

Sizes listed in reviews and the two in the description (15.8 x 10.5 x 5, and 12.5 x 9.5 x 7) don't match to what I received...The bag I received is in between what has been listed in the descriptions:  13.5" x 9" x 6" (empty).While seemingly a good quality bag, with a fair amount of straps and attached rain-cover (hidden in the heel of the bag), it seems the manufacturer (or seller) has no idea how to use a measuring tape!The bag itself is quite nice... good padding, rubberized bottom to prevent sliding, small pockets on either side, and zippers seem of reasonable quality.For the price and bag quality, I'm not complaining.  It works great on my CB750, and it does fit on the pillion of my VT1100c2 (without having to remove my rider backrest)  So if you have standard seating (or a touring/adventure style), this bag will do well for you as a pillion bag, and with a little strap adjustments, it also fits vertical on the front or back of a sissy-bar, or horizontal on a larger luggage rack... I bought these to change the tires on my GSXR. These tire irons are bigger than they appear to be. The description has them listed as small tire irons but the ones I received are 18 inches long from tip to tip and about 11.67mm thick (see pic). The thickness and the fact that these irons have a handle means you can place maximum pressure on them and they won't bend. The end has an s tip that gets under the tire and makes it easy to lift the tire over the rim. These are well made and will last a long time. The size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous. The funnel is 10" long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6" long. It states that the funnel is 4" x 4" but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2-1/4" in diameter at the widest point.It would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless. 
Really like the way it looks on my black 2 door JK. Fit was right on spot. It doesn't deflect everything but really cut down on the layer of bugs on my windshield. Put on 2009 Street Bob.  Stickers came off fine.  Fits at the A section of the front frame, little hole there.  Find a bolt, done.  (Well, that and plug it in). i use this lube all around the house....door hinges, oven hinges, key locks, sliding door tracks etc.works nicely and doesnt leave a visual layer....dries invisible 
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. These worked for my 2005 jeep grand cherokee.  I like how these bulbs will replace any of the three rear lights. II have had these on my 2003 Tahoe for over 1yr & they work great.will put them on my 1986 cutlass when they need to be changed. 
These work well.  Had to drill more holes because they are not a direct fit for the originals.  They look good. This is one-size-fits-most. It works on the filter for my 2002 Volkswagen Passat, but it's too large to grip the filter on my 1993 Chevrolet S10. My vehicle: 2004 Honda (Acura) TL 6-SPD J32A VTEC.The originals were made in the USA but these are made in Japan by NGK, or Nippon Touki (Japan Porcelain).  Iridium-tipped plugs are generally used on reciprocating powerplant-equipped airplanes.  Incidentally, Iridium/Platinum plugs are generally pre-gapped at factory and do not need re-gapping (some exceptions apply).  If re-gapped incorrectly, the tip would be damaged. 
I wish there was a guide somewhere that shows you what cars these sunshades fit. I bought this one (Super Jumbo) for my Toyota Camry, hoping it would fit. Well, it did not fit. I had to return it, and order the regular Jumbo sunshade. The regular Jumbo sunshade fits the windshield like a glove. Quality is good, and it folds up to about 14&#34;. So, if you have a 2007-2013 Toyota Camry, DO NOT BUY THIS ONE!!! Order the regular Jumbo size.Amazon, can you please look into getting some sort of reference guide that will show customers the correct vehicle application? This would make buying this product a whole lot easier.CPS These are great.  I was concerned the 7-inch size would be too much with stock tires, but they are perfect.  They give my jeep a new look and take years off the body.  Easy installation, but I will warn you, if you have the stock bolts, do yourself a favor and spend the $20 or so bucks on the hardware kit advertised on Amazon as it will save you a ton of time.  As for these fenders, perfect fit to the OEM holes and what a difference!  A simple ratchet and box end wrench were all the tools needed (and of course the small work-shop rolling seat I got on Amazon makes the job comfortable because you really need to be able to sit-down to do this job). These don't fit quite right onto the stems of my Pirelli P-Zero's. The dealership neglected to put a cap back on my tire -- so I bought these just in case. They get the job done, but don't expect them to look or fit the same. 
Very useful and precise. Even my mechanic asked me to order one for him. Beats opening the hood or even worse on my car, the battery is in the trunk under the floor. A pain to access if you have the optional rubber mat to protect the trunk floor. Installed in my IS 350. Could have used another few square feet, but it is easy to install once you remove all the carpet, spare tire and rear deck lid factory insulation. Don't forget the license plate and fuel door. I use it everyday primarily for a storage cover.  I have not had the cover on the bike in rain or weather.  I got the XL for my CBR500R with full large rear bags and windshield.  I can lock my helmet to the rear seat area put the cover on and it will cover up the entire bikes exhaust and 3/4 of the rear tire and entire front tire.  Two bungies mid bike and front tire enable hokking cover under bike.  Very sturdy and breathable with exhaust panels (silver durable material) and inner windshield liner.  Much bang for the buck. Would certainly purchase another if I had to without question. 
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Perfect fit for rear window on my 2004 Ford Excursion Limited. Easy to install. No spotting seen or squeaking at all 
It a belt... it fits, it hold and it rotates. There is no noise coming from it.Happy with the fit and performance. Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. Great Fit 
I have a 30' travel trailer.  It has built in jacks at the front and rear (4 total) along with the tongue jack but it still tends to bounce no matter how tight you get those jacks.Not a major problem, but a minor annoyanceSo I ordered these.  My camper has twin axles and the axles are square.  I put these under one of the axles and crank them up as tight as I can.  It removes 99% of the bounce in the camper.I recommend these to anyone that wants to use them for this purpose.  I suppose you could also use them at the front and back, if you don't have built in jacks. our 32' travel trailer w/ three slideouts has the factory electric stabilizer jacks at the front and back, which are great at stabilizing the ends.  But in between these, over the axles, we can feel the trailer flex and slightly bounce especially when we are entertaining & have folks congregate in the middle.  These work really well when placed just in front of the tires.  We simply crank them up snug against the frame rail on each side.  Now the trailer doesn't bounce or wiggle nearly at all.  Too bad RV manufacturers on long wheel base units don't add in a third stabilizer in the mid section to keep up/down flex movement of leaf springs & tires from causing bounce feeling. We also have the BAL X-jacks between the tires to prevent any roll effect from front to back. I bought a set of these ramps and they flat out don't work on my 2010 Dodge Ram 1500 4x2.  In my garage and/or on an asphalt parking lot they don't stay put.  When I drive up them they slide forward and my truck just scoots them along.  I have to "hold" them in place by using rubber floor mats and/or wood stoppers.  Yes, they have the rubber feet on their base but they don't hold.  Hate them....and wouldn't buy them again.  I returned them.

Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. This fit all four O2 sensors on my 2002 Toyota Tundra and I could have not completed the job without this specialized socket. Fits perfectly for my 2003 Toyota Camry, but the number of folds in the filter were fewer than the OEM one. It's short 10 folds compared to the Toyota OEM cabin air filter. 
I dont like the thick gel type dressing as they are prone to sling all over the side of the car.This product is thin enough that you can apply evenly using a simple foam pad.  I can achieve a nice natural finish, or very glossy by adding more product. It is not as nice as the 6 inch that came from the same company.  Plastic seems a little thin. If you want quality than look no further.  This is an awesome pad with a nice thickness to it. Not like those cheapies that feel thin and are flimsy. 
bought this for my 2004 honda crv.  fit perfectly and cleared the code.  easy to do just give the threads some wd40 I have previously used in: 1980 Honda CX500C to fix a rough idle, 2000 Suzuki SV650 to stabilize fuel, and a 2005 Chevy Cobalt to fix a problem with stalling at idle. Fit perfectly on my 2012 Honda Civic Si. Way better than spending the premium for Honda to do it, takes like 1 minute. 
GLAD  I  WENT  WITH  THE  CHROME AND  NOT  THE BLACK ONE, I  HOOKED  THIS ONE UP TO  MY GV1400 MOTORCYCLE IF  YOU  HAVE JUST  A  LITTLE  KNOW  HOW YOU CAN  DO  IT YOUR SELF , ALL  YOU WILL NEED TO GO WITH THIS IS A RELAY THAT DOES NOT COME WITH IT. YOU  CAN  GET IT ON HERE OR ANY PART STORE, I  HAVE MADE MANY PEOPLE JUMP  DUE  TO THE SOUND OF  THE  HORNS  LOUDNESS. This are sooooo useful. I can't tell you how many of those stupid hooks or fasteners i broke before discovering these in a car forum. I hate those plastic fasteners. This solved my problem, they are perfect and has several different shapes and sizes. Thank god i found these.  I don't understand how people can give these bad ratings. have not in stalled this product yet but looks like it will do exactly what i need it to do.

It fits perfectly to my 2005 Honda Accord.Filter quality seems to be good. bought this for my 2004 honda crv.  fit perfectly and cleared the code.  easy to do just give the threads some wd40 
Great Fit Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!!

Have not tried it in the snow yet. This fit all four O2 sensors on my 2002 Toyota Tundra and I could have not completed the job without this specialized socket.

Fits my low clearance Mazda 5 that comes with alloy wheels and 3/4 inches of clearance between the inside of the tire and the suspension.  Have not tried it in the snow yet. When I stepped up to a 34 foot fifth wheel trailer my standard chocks looked undersized against the 16&#34; trailer wheels.  These fit the bill.  Nice and strong. I bought this steering wheel cover to hide the peeling leather on my 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited steering wheel. I measured the inside dimensions of the wheel, 15". I did not have to heat or stretch the new wheel cover, it fit perfectly and looks great. It's also much easier to keep clean with interior protectant.

Does what it supposed to do,Fits most of my scooters.Does not fit a Honda Shadow 750's disc brake, because the disc is too wide.One star less, because the mechanism to mount the pouch to the handlebars is very weak, and impractical (I can't install it on handlebars of scooters because they have the handlebars covered with plastic, and can't install it on the handlebars of my motorcycle, because the hand grips and throttle are too wide, so it does not fit; the pouch also does not have a locking mechanism, so it's kind of moot to try to mount it somewhere).Otherwise, a great purchase!

This is one of the best accessories I have purchased. It fits perfectly and keeps the heat down in my Jeep. This is great all year round but especially in the summer. The front window is big and the dash and steering wheel get very hot if not covered. I would higly recommend this product for form, fit function and good looks. Carries the Jeep brand also. I recently bought a 2011 Hyundai Tucson loaded to the gills and was astonished at how impossibly wimpy the single note factory horn was.  Leather seats, nav, panoramic sunroof, bluetooth, backup camera, kick-*ss sound system with subwoofer and iPod integration, etc., all kinds of toys.  Yet the factory horn sounds almost as robust as the horn in the 1966 VW bus my family had when I was a kid.  "Meep meep."  Note I said the Hyundai horn was ALMOST as robust as the '66 VW.  I think the VW horn had a little more oomph.  What was Hyundai thinking??I found a Hyundai tech to swap the original Hyundai/Kia P.O.S. horn with this item and the results are awesome.  My first ever new-car mod and it worked out great.

These will not fit a 2014 Jeep Sahara Unlimited just in case anybody wanted to know.If by chance if you have a 2014 JKU you need a an oil filter. That number is a MOPAR 349.Our local Napa store could not bring up a part number for a new Jeep? Exact fit for Lexus RX300. As easy to install as I could've expected with all parts: the sensor, the cable and  the plug matching the original layout. Returned found better kit with colors that help match RV. You need kit with colors to match most applications. 
It is clear and the flip thing works fine.  It fit my stock mount on my windshield perfectly.  It does come with a mount for you to use, just no glue.  But, as I said, it fit my old one with no problems at all. These don't fit quite right onto the stems of my Pirelli P-Zero's. The dealership neglected to put a cap back on my tire -- so I bought these just in case. They get the job done, but don't expect them to look or fit the same. I have an old 55 GMC with a Napco 4wd on 37 inches tires and it stands pretty high. Even getting to the oil dip stick is a challenge without a step.That tire step is really great, it unfolds and installs in 2 seconds over the tire. It fits my 37x12.5 (it won't work with a bigger tire) and is pretty stable.It comes with a nice pouch with handles to carry it with you everywhere you go. It folds nicely and can be stored under your seat. A really great item, and I am considering buying a 2nd one so that I can have one on each side when I am working in the engine bay of the truck. 
I put these on my 2012 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon.  They look good and are doing well protecting the door sills. I would install this on your Jeep as soon as you purchase the vehicle.  They're very easy to install and protect you from scratches that could lead to rust.  The guards fit perfectly on my 2011 Jeep Rubicon 2 door. They do work. Exactly as advertised.

the ones I received are not identical to the picture.  one can only be installed on the side and the other can only be installed on the front (or back).  the markings are different for left to right level vs front to back level. Received within 3 days. Saw Mythbusters do a test of these LifeHammers and they worked quite well cutting through the seatbealt and any of the windows EXCEPT the WINDSHIELD. Commit that to memory! In a emergency situation it will not easily crack or break the windshield, side and rear glass only. Mine is getting mounted in clear sight and access from the front seat, right in the middle of the rear seat benches so as to be easily grabbed by all! I have had experience with a stuck seat belt and they are a bitch to cut through with a semi-sharp pockt knife. Easy to mount and adjust. Since each one is made identical (there is no right or left, you just mount the mirror differently), one has the tensioner lever right next to the mirror (drivers side in my case). That is not a problem if you place it back from your mirror. Good sturdy mount and no vibration. Once adjusted they are easy on and off.

Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. Bought them with the cruiser plates and while they did fit the plates they did not fit the wholes on the car. Dont know why. Work fine on the front but not the rear. Also they are security screws, so do not lose the device that comes with them. FYI Fits a little tight especially around the front fender and floorboards but it works.  I have a 03' Shadow ACE 750cc.  After a couple rain storms I can report my bike stayed dry (except a portion of the front wheel) and through heavy winds, the motorcycle cover stayed put.  What&#8217;s nice about this cover is the price and how it has elastic hooks to secure the cover in place.  If you decide to buy a cover and your bike has a windshield, floor boards and aftermarket mirrors I recommend you buy a 2XL (if your bike is similar in size to a Shadow 750cc).  Look at the picture I posted, mine has stock mirrors and no windshield and fits VERY tight.  My mirrors shift out of place when the cover is on.  Before each ride I have to adjust them cause the cover is soo tight.  Also, if you have floor boards that&#8217;ll make the fit even more tighter.  Buying one size bigger and I would say you bike will be 100% covered.

This seems to be one of the better levelers. There are two different scales on these levels. One is for the side-to-side (back of the coach) and the other is for the front-to-back (side of the coach). The reason there are different scales are they are more-or-less calibrated in inches.For example, it is simple Trigonometry to determine how many inches the coach is out of level simply by using the formula for right-angles and solve for one side. The input values are the angle (determined by the level) and distance from the level to the point at where you want to know how many inches of lift are needed.For the side-to-side level, the 1&#34; markings are pretty accurate as long as you put the scale in the center of the coach, as most coaches are within an inch or two of width from another.  However, for the front-to-back level, even though you put the scale in the center, the result will vary wildly due to the length of the coach. Using this level on a 18ft coach will result in a far different measurement than say a 35ft coach.Also, if you don't put the level in the center (in the side or back), then the two ends of the coach will be different. For example, if the level is in the center, then when the level measures 1&#34; off level, that means 1&#34; on either front or back. But if you put the level off-center, then the level reading 1&#34; might truly be 1/2&#34; on one end, and 1 1/2&#34; on the other. Again, it is simply a principle of Right Angles in Trigonometry.Also, do not rely on the self-adhesive backing as over time it can move. As hard as it may be for you to do, drilling a couple holes and inserting screws into the levels is the best bet. The pair of levels are a great value.  I recently purchased these for a second time, as the originals were sold with my previous trailer and I wanted to make my new trailer easier to get on a level stance.There really isn't much to go wrong as far as product failure is concerned.  Accuracy is up to you with the initial installation.Recommended method of installation is to get your trailer level/RV, front to back, and side to side.  Once you have your trailer true, install the graduated levels in locations which will show you front to back level (placed on the side of the trailer) and side to side (place on the front or back of the trailer).  Make sure the bubble indicates "level" by being in the center point of the tube.Installation should be done once all your components are "stressed" as they will be for trailer/RV use (I.E. front tongue on a travel trailer, all the normal weight sitting on the winch foot, or in the case of 5th wheels/motorcoaches, landing gear down), try to place the levels on the RV in clear view of the winch/landing gear controls to enable leveling without having to relocate to a different location to view the levels.I accomplished this on a travel trailer by placing one level on the very front center, and the other on the side of the frame tongue close to the winch.  Though small, with sharp eye-sight, you can take advantage of the one on the front of the trailer as you position the trailer to see if you can establish a level side to side stance as you near your desired location.On my 5th wheel, my landing gear controls are on the front corner of the main body.  I placed one on the side of the rig for front to back level, and another right around the corner on the front side (for side to side level) still within sight of the controls, as well as from the truck cab for backing up.  Even though the level is off center, if it is installed properly with the trailer level at the time of installation, it will work fine.As far as the graduated scales are concerned, you will have to find your "scale" for adjustments, as it depends on where the levels are placed in reference to the center of the pivot points.The levels come with a self adhesive foam strip on the back for placement as well as two holes for screws if you wish to drill holes in the side of your rig.  I go with the adhesive strip route, as I don't like unnecessary holes.  The only negative with the adhesive strips is they will flex if stressed and it can put the levels off level, though this only happened to me with the first pair after the foam tape aged a few years.One last comment . . .the green bubble tube will fade from extended UV exposure.  It will not interfere with the accuracy, just makes it a little harder to read.If you are looking for larger levels which can be read from a distance, I know they are out there, but I have no experience with them to make a comparison.  I do not wish to clutter the appearance of the rig with large levels. The install is easy, just level your camper using a carpenter level of 3 feet or longer.  Set the level from side-to-side on your smooth flooring or counter top. Then set the level from front-to-back the same way on the smooth flooring or counter top.  Now position the Hopkins 08525 levels, one on the side you prefer to work from at the front of the camper, on a flat vertical surface.  Do the same on a side wall near the front corner on a smooth vertical surface.  Use the double stick tape to position, but consider adding pop rivets or small screws to hold the setting for many years.  Holes are provided in the Hopkins levels.Use the front level first to drive onto leveling ramps or boards, then use the side level along with the tongue jack to finish (after you unhitch). Extend your stabilizer jacks and you're set for level comfortable sleeping in your camper. 
I use this to monitor my RV battery.  Even though I have a solar system charge controller which displays voltage too, I use this sometimes to double check before I plug additional items in one of several 12 volt sockets I had installed.  I like it so much for its simplicity, that I'm buying a 2nd one for my truck.  This gadget is so simple to use and so accurate, that if you're on the fence about buying this, just do it.  More than worth the price!  Gives me a peace of mind at a glance. I bought this to work with the Master Flow 1040 air pump. I have one and it never blew my fuse. I have been reading that some vehicles may have lower rated fuses in the Accessory circuit. I tested this by connecting it to the battery and the pump ran just fine. I purchased the JNC300XL for my wife, because she has a habit of leaving some load "on" and drain her battery.  I was attracted to this product because, (1) it was ranked well on amazon, (2) it does have lots a solid reviews, and (3) it was small and not too heavy for my wife.  Before purchasing this product, I was spectacle of the "900 Peak Amp" rating.  I researched all of the internet to try to find any battery specs that comes inside this so-called jump starter.  When it arrived I tried it on a friends sedan.  Connected it up, turned over the car, and nothing.  I took the JNC300XL back home and opened it up to check the battery.  It is an 8ah battery inside. To be frank, I am not a battery expert, but how can a 8ah battery delivery 800 peak amps? I reassembled the JNC300XL and connected it back up it my friends car, and left it connected for several hours (~2-3 hours), and it did eventually work. If you are purchasing this as a jumper starter for emergency situations, I think you will be disappointed.  If you just need something to boost your battery, and time is not an issue, it works just fine.  I just think the product description is misleading.  It should say battery booster, not jump starter. 
The meter has all the functions you could ask for a multimeter in a compact size.  The digits are large for the size of the meter, so it's easily readable by middle aged eyes. It does get a bit warm while providing the 5 amps of power to the Koolatron car cooler (which I took into hotel rooms at night), but it did exactly what it was supposed to do so can't complain. One issue: There are two different sizes for so-called "cigarette lighter" outlets. This has the "big" size, which means "small" size plugs can have issues. Solution if that is a problem for your particular plug is simply to use a toothpick to "shim" the small-size plug into the large-size socket. 32mm is the correct size for my Jetta TDI oil cap, and this fits perfectly.It's also fairly low profile, another plus. 
A little 1/2 ounce tube at the parts store was almost 5 bucks. this is great for exhaust manifold bolts and where heat and rust are a problem. Comes with an applicator brush attached to the cap. Can use on all bolts, never have to worry about breaking another bolt cause it welded itself to the thread. a must for auto enthusiasts. Great spark plugs, the exact type my motorcycle required.  Very good quality plugs, gap already set appropriately.  They all come cylindrical cardboard tube over electrode to protect plugs while in the box.  So you have no worries of your box being dropped and cracking your porcelain around the electrode.Very clean, crisp threads and installed in motorcycle heads with ease.INSERT tip:  using a 3/8" rubber hose approximately 6-8" long, slide it over the top end of plug and use to insert plug into place.  If you begin to cross thread during insertion the rubber hose will slip around plug.  Whereas, with a ratchet one might be apt to keep tightening at this point, thus ruining the female threads in your cylinder head.ChrisEastern NC Can place inside the fill tube and walk away - didn't come shooting back out against the water pressure.  Only complaint is that it is a little long where the threaded portion connects with the hose.  Had to install another rubber gasket to get it to stop leaking. 
This works exactly as you expect. If your gap is too small, you can just slightly tilt the entire gauge while measuring the gap, and the gap will extend some... that is, measure, push to extend, re-measure, and repeat until you have the right gap.You can also use the inside of the small ring area to expand the gap. This is where I think the tool could improve. The small edge of the wedge on the inner ring could be smaller. Once, I happened to tap my gap too small to fit on that wedge, and had some trouble getting the gap to open back up enough to again work on the gauge.All in all, though, this is a necessity in my motorcycle tool bag. There are two horns, not one. One is 400Hz and the other one is 500Hz.PIAA | Automotive Sports Horn (400/500Hz) #85110The are exact fits on the mounts as the OEM horns and use the same bolts. A 1/4 inch drive ratchet and a 12mm socket is needed to remove and install the bolt. They came with grounding leads with ring spade lugs that mounted readily under the existing M6 bolts on the radiator supports. All you need is a 10mm socket.The two wiring harness leads are too short to connect the horns. Two wire tie mounts hold the harness to the aluminum bumper reinforcement. You can cut off the ties and use the OEM harness to connect the horns, but I chose not to.  I prefer NOT to cut off the OEM connector blocks.I made two pigtail extensions out of 18 gauge black primary wire, 5 inches long. One end needs a 1/4 inch wide exposed male quick disconnect. The other end needs an insulated female 1/4 inch quick disconnect terminal. Since I used 18 gauge wire, I used the red coded ones.The exposed male connector slides into the OEM horn connector perfectly. The female one clips easily onto the positive terminal of each horn.The horns how have a weather shield on the apertures.Best thing to my surprise is that they appear to be very high quality and Made in Japan.Also nice is that they need no modification to the horn relay or circuit. Solid pin. The keyhole cover slips often. I added 3 rubber o-rings to snug it up to the 2 inch hitch.

They came with grounding leads with ring spade lugs that mounted readily under the existing M6 bolts on the radiator supports. All you need is a 10mm socket.The two wiring harness leads are too short to connect the horns. Two wire tie mounts hold the harness to the aluminum bumper reinforcement. You can cut off the ties and use the OEM harness to connect the horns, but I chose not to.  I prefer NOT to cut off the OEM connector blocks.I made two pigtail extensions out of 18 gauge black primary wire, 5 inches long. One end needs a 1/4 inch wide exposed male quick disconnect. The other end needs an insulated female 1/4 inch quick disconnect terminal. Since I used 18 gauge wire, I used the red coded ones.The exposed male connector slides into the OEM horn connector perfectly. The female one clips easily onto the positive terminal of each horn.The horns how have a weather shield on the apertures.Best thing to my surprise is that they appear to be very high quality and Made in Japan.Also nice is that they need no modification to the horn relay or circuit. These were a perfect fit for my 2001 Silverado 2500HD with the 6.0 but I had to do some research to make sure I bought the correct wire set.  GM used round or square coils (two different manufacturers) for a few years and the plug wire lengths are different. If you have the round coils (plug wire connector on the bottom of the coil) you need these shorter wires ending in &#34;GG&#34;.  If you have the square coils with the plug wire connector on the side of the coil, you need the longer wires ending in &#34;HH&#34;. The HH wires are about 1.5 inches longer for than the GG's.  You cannot make the shorter wires reach a square coil. Installed this with a Curt hitch on a 2002 crv. It plugs into the ready made connection by the driver side quarter panel. I store the extra cord beneath the table in the storage area and just run the cord out through the rear door when towing. The weatherstripping protects the wiring from damage. Very easy and no splicing and wiring to mess with. Hope this review helps. 
The Tender Jr. does not come with a cigarette adapter so I cut this in half to make two. I purchased 2 lighter plugs for a buck each from China&#8230; with free shipping&#8230; and they are working fine. These aren&#8217;t an exact match with the Tender cables but they fit together OK and are easy to determine polarity with the wire colors. You can also just use this as an extension cord for your Tender. The description states a length of 12-inches&#8230; but it&#8217;s actually 14-inches tip-to-tip on the connectors. Nice item for the price and it&#8217;s made in Mexico. The RP-203EC is just what is says it is - a 12' extension cable for 12VDC. I needed a cable to extend the length to the cigarette adapter in one of my cars.  It was just what I needed.  All in all, it is nothing fancy, but the price makes it hard to pass up. It does get a bit warm while providing the 5 amps of power to the Koolatron car cooler (which I took into hotel rooms at night), but it did exactly what it was supposed to do so can't complain. One issue: There are two different sizes for so-called "cigarette lighter" outlets. This has the "big" size, which means "small" size plugs can have issues. Solution if that is a problem for your particular plug is simply to use a toothpick to "shim" the small-size plug into the large-size socket.

The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around! Fits well into the 7 pin socket and holds the 4 pin socket securely.  Works just like it's supposed to.  Nice adapter 
Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. a regular 32mm socket will not fit in the space of my equinox. this is a kind of shorter 32mm socket designed only for oil filter cap job. it works fine. 
Works great, nice to have a second cable, but the OBD end of the cable is angled.  In my case, this cable won't work on my Subaru Outback.  I would prefer the option of a straight OBD connector.  Note that the angle connector works on my other four cars (Mazda, Honda, Dodge). This is a plastic sandwich type holder for the flat 4 wire connector.  Not only did my connector fit loose and tilt at an angle as a result, but the holder did not have a proper channel to fit the cover for the 4 wire connector I just bought. The channel provided for the cover is very small and is evidently application specific. This was a waste of money.  I had to buy a different mounting bracket from a trailer place. The GM bumper connector has its own cap to keep the weather out, and so does this Adapter. But I really wouldn't leave this adapter plugged in all the time because the GM connector then is not sealed.This adapter fits well, with a locating keyway that fits the groove of the GM connector, aligning all the pins correctly. It's a tight fit so that it won't fall out in case the cable to your trailer has enough weight to tug on this adapter to any significant degree.I don't have any illumination problems so the LED functions are not fully tested.  Frankly, I do a walk-around after hooking up anyway, with marker lights and flashers on to check that everything works.  I presume the LEDs will tell me if there's an issue some day. 
Works as advertised. IT WORKS These item does fit perfect on my 2004 BMW x3. does what its suppose to do. so far so good thanks 
Used this with 1 gallon of distilled water, fill up the rest of my car with 50/50 mix, WOW my car runs cool now! It use to overheat on hot summer days with A/C on, now, the temp gauge actually goes down from time to time! Love it, will use every summer! I used to hold the EZ-pass up each time we hit a toll. This is great since we don't use the tolls on a daily basis. You can take the EZ-pass down with no sign it was there. Suction cups are STRONG. We've used it in all weather. Hot summers, cold winters, and rainy days are no problem.  Great gift or stocking stuffer. Too bad it can't alleviate NY traffic! I have 2 lawn mowers for summer and a snow blower for winter.  I have used Sta-bil for years in the gas can which I use for these machines for over 10 years.  The lawn mower sits around for months with gas in it over the winter.  Using Sta-bil prevents the &#8220;gum and varnish&#8221; residue that can be left behind when gasoline evaporates.  No need to drain the mowers or blowers every season.  The engines usually start right up after having been left idle for months.  Sta-bil has worked me and I will continue to use it. 
This wax goes on easy but you will get a work out taking it off but that will pay off, this wax will last for a while. I have applied it several months ago and the water still beeds up like I waxed it last week.  I used a electric buffer to take it off that will make it easier on you. Been using these dusters ever since I got my first car, over 20 years ago!!.. Worth every dollar, I use this to get the bulk of the dust off, then I use meguirs quik detailer spray and a microfiber rag to clean the body then rims. Last some stoner window cleaner and it looks better then what the car wash can do!!!!! I remember seeing an infomercial for Turtle Wax Ice when it was first introduced a few years ago.  I must admit, I was a bit skeptical that you could use it in direct sunlight and on plastics (admit it, all of you were too) but after finally buying some of this product all I have to say is WOW.  The results are astounding.  I drive a black Chevy Cobalt, and all of you who drive black cars know how hard they are to wax with conventional waxes.  The first wax this season I used the original Turtle Wax paste and I left little areas of it here and there all over the car that would not come off until I washed it.  With Ice, I don't have this problem.  It goes on clear and stays clear.  It somewhat has the consistency of baby oil.  It's so slick I often drop the bottle several times while going over the car, and have to wash the bottle off with soap and water when I'm finished.  One bottle of Ice will last you a long time.  I have waxed my Cobalt at least 4 times this summer and my Blazer once and I have used only about an ounce of the wax, at this rate this bottle will last at least 4 years.As for repelling water, Ice does an excellent job.  Water easily beads up and rolls off the car.  I can't yet comment on the durability of Ice, as I've used it after just about every wash this summer!  I apply Ice to all the exterior surfaces of my car (except for the glass), it makes the headlights glimmer in the sun and the plastic trim a deep, lustrous black (like when the car was new).  My coworkers are always asking me how I keep my car so shiny.  I even applied it to the taillights of our 2001 Blazer, one of which was a little oxidized, and while it didn't remove the oxidation it did add a little shine so it's not so noticeable.  I would apply Ice to the tires if I thought it would be safe!While Ice is a great product, it isn't perfect and does suffer from some of the same issues all waxes do.  Being that Ice is a new type of wax, it does take a bit of getting used to.  Leaving it on too long can leave a film on the car which will only come off after washing the car.  You seriously only need to leave this wax on no more than 10 minutes!  I found the best way to use Ice is to do sections of the car at a time.I highly recommend Turtle Wax Ice. 
I have been using this polish on my cars for years. Twice a year I polish THEN wax with meguiars high tech yellow wax. It's the polish that shines the car, then the wax protects the polish. Easy to wipe on, easy to remove. The best thing is it does not take long to do and it keep the car looking new. This wax has provided a durable, high gloss finish to my 2004 dark blue metallic GTO. I wax the upper surfaces every 3 months and the rest of the car every 6 months. If you use this wax regularly and garage your car at night, you won't ever need to use a cleaner product. Have used for years. It is the best car wash going. Removes the dirt, bugs and road grime, but, but leaves your wax on the car. 
These worked great to lift my car - very stable and sturdy, and I like that they were made in the USA.  A quality product. OTC is reliable, and this is also reliable.  The parts are durable and machined well.  If you wok on front ends, you need this kit.  The case is also durable. I purchased this product for my parents to use on a ceiling vent.  They were pleased with the product overall.  It was sturdy, easy to install, and serves the purpose of the purchase.  They said the magnet held on well also. 
After the battery is mostly charged, this charger goes to 16.4 volts and starts boiling the electrolyte. Normally when battery is mostly charged, the voltage should not go that high!!! The charger did not switch to a float mode either as it was supposed to.To make sure it is not a battery issue, I tried to use this charger on 3 different batteries and saw the same result. Charger at 16.4 volts and boiling electrolyte. If I was not keeping a close eye on the charger, it would have destroyed my battery by boiling out all electrolyte. I thought this thing is "smart" and "automatic."Did I also mention that one time I was tried to use the charger(see above for results) it was making a lot of loud noise because of a constantly running cooling fan. Excellent battery tender......keeps a constant charge on my battery.........shuts off when it has powered up the battery......really nothing to do but, but, turn it off when full. This is the Cadillac of battery chargers.  I put my Miata on the charger each winter.  Doesn't overcharge the battery, doesn't dry out the cells, just works perfectly.  It will even charge up a dead battery if you give it a few days.  At this low amperage it isn't ideal for this, but it will work.This is about $50.  A new battery is about $100.  Leaving a battery discharging or not charging for a long time (months) kills the battery.  Do the math and you see you can't afford not to have one. 
Does what it says it does......looks great ! It does exactly what it's supposed to do. No problems whatsoever. It does what it is supposed to do, that is to increase placement distance from the car to the electrical outlet 
Do yourself a HUGE favor and use a mass flow (MAF) senor cleaner to clean the MAF sensor.  DON'T use carburetor, fuel injector or throttle body cleaner or you'll ruin the MAF sensor. I required an ammonia-free window cleaner for my tinted windows. This does the job quite nicely. It isn't how well it does, rather how safely it does it. You'll never go back to conventional wipers after these.  Smooth, no chattering, wipes clean without streaking, and very easy to install.  Note: no snow where I live, so I don't know how they perform in cold climates 
This thing has 2 readouts and 4 scales and no instructions on how to read any of htem.  The SWR is easy enough to figure out but the others are anyones guess, came with some little wire antenna that is nowhere in the one sheet instruction that comes with it.  The signal strength meter dosn't seem to register at all.  It was cheap enough and probelly works, but your  have to find an engineer to tell you how to use it. When it works it works okay.But have to tap on it sometimes to get it to register. Makes me wonder how accurate it is... I probably should compare it to another to see how accurate it is, but I really like how easy it is to use and turns off and on by itself.

I decided to try this product on the recommendation of a friend who repairs and rebuilds transmissions for a living.  The vehicles I used it in are a 2004 GM 5.3L V8 with 4L60E 4-spd and a 2001 Honda 2.0L I4 AWD auto 4-spd.  The ATF in both vehicles had less than 25k miles on it, so I did not flush the system before using this.  Instead, I drained the pans, added the recommended amount of Lubegard Red ATF Protectant, and then refilled the pan using Valvoline Maxlife ATF in the GM and Honda ATF Z1 in the Honda.The result has been transmissions that shift faster and smoother.  The Honda is also less &#34;jerky&#34; (it has always been pretty sensitive to throttle inputs).  I also noticed the Honda has a more positive torque converter lockup since adding Lubegard.I'm happy with the performance of this product so far and plan on continuing to use it. Used this on my 2004 BMW 325Ci for my Transmission Fluid Change. Noticed an immediate difference on how the car shifts. I would recommend this product to all BMW owners This product does not work exactly how Lucas says it does. I used this in a Detroit engine that was not burning oil before I used it but afterwards was.I have talked with many drivers (truck drivers) who have used this with the same results. I will never touch another Lucas product. This stuff is a sham and a waste of a Drivers hard earned money. If you want to do something good for your engine use Synthetic engine oil. 
Great wheel lock that is easy to activate and unlock.  It comes with 3 keys, one of which has a LED light on it.  The product also comes with a reminder cord that attaches to the handle bar as a reminder.  It does just what I was looking for. Does what it says it does......looks great ! Well built with a weatherproof cover; comes with two keys and will protect your hitch or what ever you need to protect. 
A good buy.  Does the same job that the Honda OEM part does. Does what it says it does......looks great ! Does what it is designed to do and Amazon has great prices on them. But, if you are replacing yours on a ford f-250 with 5.4 go with 15718 with the longer cord. And a 2003 f250 w/5.4L only has 2 not 4 like it shows. 
Front side (towards the engine) oxygen sensor fit "exactly." That means there is not a bit of "extra" wire from the sensor to the connector. They do make one with a longer cord, but not sure why, because you can't get your hand/arm in there any better with a longer cord anyway!I did the front sensors on both sides of the car, because someone recommend it to keep things running smoothly on both sides. Glad I did, it seems to be working.Got a wrench? I ordered a fancy pants "socket" from Amazon along with the sensors to get into the "tight" spot. It turned out that the fancy sockets do NOT fit on the front sensors, at least not on this car, and then I ran around town trying to find one of those fancy pants "special" wrenches with the "split" socket on the end, but nobody had them.In desperation, and hoping for the best, I purchased a standard 7/8" combination wrench (where the heck is mine anyway?) to get the sensor off. Oops, I put the wrench on the old sensor and it wasn't even tight (probably why it gave me the DTC)! Installation was easy, aside from the arm and hand contortions getting the plugs loose (try a long shaft screwdriver from below to pop the clip while you're holding the other end from above).Note, on my car, "bank 1" is the cylinder set on the passenger side of the car! I could give you a long review full of performance enhancement claims, but I'll just be blunt. Ever since I switched to K&N, my used oil seems less dirty when I drain it and having the 1" nut welded to the top of the filter makes changing it a breeze. If you own a car with a hard to reach filter, that nut alone will make it worth every penny of the filter's cost. I have a Toyota Camry where I can barely even get my hand back to the filter through the tiny opening, let alone get enough leverage to loosen it by hand or use a conventional filter wrench. Not an issue with this filter. 1" socket on a ratchet with an extension shaft and it comes right off in just a few seconds. Works well but hard to empty. No matter how hard I try, I always end up with some spillage. Otherwise it's good for quick and easy oil changes. Both my cars have top mount filter cartridges. So why go under the car? If I had a car that required me to go under, I'd probably just pull the drain plug instead.

This is THE high temp silicone gasket sealant for stopping leaks or forming a makeshift seal in a pinch if you can't find a gasket. First off the label says it it non-toxic, which is kinda strange considering that it also says not to allow it to contact skin, eyes, painted surfaces and brake systems. I guess what they mean is that it can cause serious injury but wont kill you. Anyway the good stuff:Claims to work on:Engine leaksTransmission leaksPower steering leaksRack and pinion leaks& any other fluid systemException: do not use in brake systems.Pros:Does not appear to mush out (over-soften) rubber seals/rings when used full strength (undiluted). Seals seem to retain their elasticity and tensile strength (great).Not much odor, clear and easy to handle.Cheap for what it claims it does.Cons:Tiny bottle 8 oz.Observations:So far, I have not yet seen where the rubber seals/rings increase in size (expand)when soaked overnight at full strength (this was a bit odd).Cheap enough to be used for testing purposes. Based on limited testing I can only say that it seems that it would only seal very tiny leaks, since the rubber seals dont appear to swell (within human perception).I will update when further info becomes available (shortly). I am currently testing on a few items: transmission dipstick seal, civic top cover bolt seals, AC coupler o-ring, distributor seal, suspension bushing (front and back), radiator cap seal (watching this one closely).I will also change the rating - i hope it will do well.Update on Nov 10, 2012Transmission dipstick seal - works great, its now firmly in place - was very loose before using.Engine Oil dipstick seal  - works great, its now super firm in placeNote: Both dipstick seals took a whole week to swell and notice the difference.Civic top cover bolt seals - just applied some today, have to wait on results.AC coupler o-ring - no visible signs yet. Will have to use on live AC system totest. Windshield wiper rubber - Not recommended, rubber becomes too sticky and uneven - does not  clean debris well after use.Update to Jan 26, 2013:  Used it to stop a small power steering. It did make some difference to slow the leak even more. It did not stop the top cover bolt leak, nor the small transmission & engine leak (Only used a little in all three).Radiator cap seems marginally more prone to leaking after the fact. So I guess this product works best under certain "ideal" conditions. I would still buy itfor specialist applications due to its cheap cost. The 32778 Slide Out Rubber Seal Conditioner made things alittle better. But I am going to replace the seals. Not because of the conditioner. They have weather cracks on my seals. 
Filter is one of the best, price is one of the worst in the market.When you can get one of these for 5.38 at KMart why would you even want to buy it from amazon?I do not. This is a great product, love using this....but why the huge price increase?? almost doubled?I use this product on my side windows as well, works as good as Rainex. It really make water bead really good.I really recommend this product when it was going for $5.99....currently double?? I can get it cheaper at the local stores.My last 2 orders for this product either arrived damaged (leaked all over the place) or undeliverable because it was damaged. Still waiting more than a few months for Amazon.com to address this. 2007 2008 2009 2010 i spent more than $4000 buying stuff on Amazon.com  2011....have yet to spend a penny at Amazon.com. All cuz Amazon did not want to address a $12 purchase. I will never not use Sta-bil in all my power equipment, except my everyday use car. Everything else gets the treatment. It is like it was mentioned in another review "you never know when a toy or article will not get used for sometime." So better safe than sorry. I apply this to the bulk gas dispensers I maintain and thus each time I refill a mower, edger, etc. it will get treated. In so far as my boat, I maintain a bottle on-board so it is readily available to apply whenever I refuel at an auto service station. I buy this from Amazon because I get it just about a buck cheaper than the local brick-n-mortar vendors because I have Amazon Prime which shipping is free and quick. I save mostly on sales tax and it's nice to have something come right up to your door, and not have to wait in line at the local Whale-Mart. 
This fits nicely into my boat's HVAC system.  The original one was NASTY!  Hire a contortionist to install it for you. I installed this brake controller in a 1955 GMC pickup truck that I use for towing. Just follow the diagram for wiring and it just works like a breeze. I like the way you can adjust easily the voltage with the dial on the left and the mounts provided allows you to install it a convenient location under the dash (it works in any position).If you want to install this in a more modern truck without tapping directly into the wires, you will need additional adapters at extra cost. A snap to install, and easily transferred from one vehicle to another. I couldn't believe all the information that you can get off of the car's computer system. 
This four station battery tender is just as simple to use as the single units.  One simply plugs the unit in and connects the battery via alligator clips or a connection affixed to the battery. Its a simple task to tell what state the battery is in.  If amber the battery is deep charging, if green range it is 80 to 100% charged.  After the battery is charged, leaving in connected will put the unit in float mode, which will keep the battery "topped off" without damaging it.  My only concern is the housing is plastic and all of my single units are metal.  It does have mounting holes so it can be wall mounted or affixed more securely to a shelf, etc.  Like the single units, total time from opening the box to charging is about 2 minutes.By the way, instructions for deciphering the state of the amber and green lights are not in the instruction manual but on the right side of the unit.I also ordered the 12 foot extension cables, a good call if you need to have your batteries more than about four feet from the unit. I cut this extention in half and either solder and use shrink tube or use but connectors with shrink tube and have used it on my bikes or vehicles ove the years as add on accessory disconnects. I use the red as positive and the white as negative and the exposed white connetor with the covered red connector to connect to the battery to protect the wire from shorting out. This thing is Awsome.  It has all a camper or over the road traveler needs for emergency power and presurized air.  Comes with Battery Cables, Air Pressure Hose and Coinnections, Instruction Booklet (a must read), and several types of power outlets.  You will need an electrical extension cord, which is not included, to charge it up via AC Outlet, or you can charge it up via the 12Volt Auto Lighter Adapter Cord, which is included, but which I would not recomend unless you have no other source of power, because this thing looks like it packs a punch.  I like it and think it's worth the money.  I just started using it so Icannot speak to its durability, bt otherwise it is Awsome.  Recomend. 
these appear to be quality, and perform as expected for leads.  No issues, and price is right.  A lot cheaper than the leading brand's leads. While this fuel system cleaner is pricey compared with many others, it has the highest amount of poly-ethyl-amine (PEA) and as a result it has a very bad smell. However, it is the best fuel cleaner on the market, and I use it every oil change. This is cheaper and is at least equivalent to the other popular fuel system cleaner by Amsoil. It is also about 3x stronger than regular Techron, and it's about the same price when on sale. Excellent product, 5 stars. These filters are of a better quality than stock, cost about the same or less than stock and are mudh easier to remove.  Even the feel between stock and these K & N's is noticable.  They use better quality cases, filter media and gaskets.  Highly recommend. 
I use it all the time.  I use it to basically flood my engine via the intake/vacuum line.  I let it suck up about 2/3 of the bottle slowly without it killing the engine and then last 1/3rd I just push the vacuum line completely in the bottle and let the engine die essentially.  Then I let it sit anywhere from 30mins to overnight.  Next time you start the car, it will be smoking white smoke (as it burns off all the carbon build up that it helped dissolve) for maybe 5-10mins.  I do this about ever 6mo or so. This stuff is awesome. I put my first bottle (about half of it) in my ATV which was running a little rough. Threw some in the fuel tank and then sprayed some (with a spray bottle) directly into the carb while running. Let it sit for 5 minutes and repeated. It instantly ran smoother and had better throttle response. I thought okay, not bad for a quick &#34;miracle in a bottle&#34;. So i went over to my weed wacker which would run like crap at anything over half throttle. I figured if this stuff could fix my weed wacker than it has my approval.  I added a little to the fuel and repeated the same process (spraying in the carb and letting it sit twice). It smoked a ton but ran like it was straight out of the box new. SOLD! I love this stuff.Long story short I bought three more bottles and put it in both of my vehicles, my snowblower, generator, leaf blower, lawn mower, outboard mower, and anything else with an engine. Everything runs like it is brand new. Forget bringing your stuff to get fixed by a mechanic. For cheap money up front you can do a little preventative maintenance and stabilize, clean the gunk out of your machines, and keep them running smoothly.When I put it in my vehicles, I threw a third of the bottle in the fuel tank, SLOOOOWLY (READ SLOWLY) dripped a third of the bottle in my vacuum line, and may toss the last third in the oil right before my next oil change. If you throw it in the oil you need to change the oil and filter within 100 miles or it will be bad for the engine. Don't put it in the vacuum line quickly or you will hydrolock your motor and destroy your engine. You will be fine as long as you slowly drip it. DO NOT &#34;slurp it&#34; by sticking the vacuum line in the bottle. People do this all over youtube and it's the wrong way to do it. That is a recipe for disaster.  Just buy it and you will love it. I was apprehensive because of the reviews with people saying theirs only worked once.. But I get the feeling that they didn't understand how the thing works. You can easily damage the components by using it wrong. You pump the thing 3-4 times per quart, but you don't want to sit and pump while you're removing the fluids, that isn't how it works. Pump it a 3-4 times and wait for it to get done, then do it again. It goes pretty fast! I did my brakes, trany, oil, power steering, transfer case, and differential before pulling the plug to get the rest and not make a mess and radiator fluid on a couple different vehicles.. went smoothly. I recommend buying a half inch hose clamp for the rubber reducer. 
because, I have not used these yet.  I know they will be quite wonderful when I do need to use them This are sooooo useful. I can't tell you how many of those stupid hooks or fasteners i broke before discovering these in a car forum. I hate those plastic fasteners. This solved my problem, they are perfect and has several different shapes and sizes. Thank god i found these.  I don't understand how people can give these bad ratings. Cant say how it works until/if i ever need to remove the O2 sensor I used it to install.If i ever run out I will buy more. 
As title states, purchased for my wifes 2010 NIssan Rogue. Can never be prepared enough when it comes to families and the vehicles we drive. Opened up package and turned on car, plugged it in to make sure it works. BAM... Does just what it was intended to do. Any tech should have one of this when recommending replacement of a customers tire. Some states require you have this for state inspection. I've an Optima in my old Corvette that has now failed.  I've have read thru their warranty information.  It states that the battery must be returned to the selling dealer for warranty service.  It cannot be returned to Amazon for any reason.  Therefore my question is this:If the battery purchased thru amazon should require warranty service, how is this done and by whom? 
Always make sure you measure your plugs before install, this tool will do it for you do it yourselfers, thanks!! Don't believe auto makers that claim differentials never need their lubrication replaced, they only say that to avoid the costs during their &#34;free scheduled maintenance&#34; by removing this item from their traditional scheduled maintenance programs. This is one of the best oils for standard differentials; limited-slip differentials take a different Redline product. If you plan to keep your car for a long time, replace it every 30,000 miles, and Redline products are some of the best. I use this in my '91 BMW 850i which I plan to keep for a long time. I don't have much to say about it. Its a filter. Don't notice any extra &#34;freshness&#34; to the air. I had an old filter and it didn't smell, so this one doesn't add any extra benefit to me. I'll probably just stick to the cheaper filter next time. Definitely change these yourself. DO NOT let your oil change guys do it for you. Look up your car on Youtube and type is cabin filter replacement. I'm sure you'll find a simple step by step video on how to do it yourself. I'm guessing you'll save $30+ 
Wow! this product really works! It saved my neck, and stopped the rear main seal leak in my 01 Dodge Intrepid. Following what Scotty Kilmer recommended I just added the full bottle into my engine oil and took my car for a drive for several hours. Left it over night to do it's "magic"  The next morning the leak was still leaking but less then before.... After several days the leak was sealed and no more leaks. I will put another update after 6 months (when i do an oil change im going to add another bottle to full seal the leak). But this isn't a product that will seal right away takes time just like a wound would when you put a bandage on it. I have a 2001 Acura Integra with slow leak out the front main seal, and a camshaft seal.  At first ( after the suggested 5 hrs ) it did nothing to slow down or stop the leak.  But after a few days, checking morning and evening for the leak, it finally stopped.  I'm completely amazed that such a product exists AND works.  Will be using at oil changes until it's time to fix the leak for good. The cap failed to open properly after about 4 weeks....it would not open without extreme force...and after the 3rd event of not opening I discarded and went to Napa parts. The Napa parts fuel cap was about $0.98 more but still smoothly operating. I 
First, as with all of the Dupli-Color Metalcast paints, if you want the metalcast effect, you'll have to use the Dupli-Color Metalcast Ground Coat (MC100) on the surface before you apply the color or it will not come out right. The can says that it also comes out the same if you're painting directly onto chrome like surface but I have not tried this so I don't know. Now for this green. I'm more of a blue and purple guy for dark colors so only by my personal preference do I say that this green comes out just a tad light in color for me. Overall though, if you use the ground coat this comes out great with a nice metal sheen. I recommend this product. I have a dark colored car, so I purchased one of those "black" tinted spray waxes which claimed it also cleans and shines black plastic and metal trim.  Wrong.  I also use a regular (not black) liquid spray polish detailer.  It's okay on regular black plastic and window trim surfaces.But neither could clean the paste wax residue ruining the look of the textured black plastic on top of my rear bumper.  But Mothers Back-to-Black certainly did.  Now my car looks showroom new again.The product is a cream colored liquid (not black).  So my product applicator (an old sock) and my wiping cloth (an old t-shirt, both from my husband) aren't stained.  I'm very happy and I would I highly recommend this product to everyone. This is great wax! It truly deserves the Gold Class name. I use this after the Meguiar's Ultimate Polish. I also have migrated to a 6 in buffer/polisher. I used to do all of my polishing and waxing by hand, and with the buffer, this turns out great. I have an 89 LeSabre that is Black Sapphire in color. Before using the polish/wax combo, it looked more like a darker blue. Nothing really deep. After polishing and waxing, it now looks like the black in black sapphire. It looks great in the shade, as it should and looks beautiful in the sun. There is a nice deep, glassy color, and I am pleased with the results. The water also beads very nice, too. 
IT WORKS Works as advertised. does the job. 
I bought this product and you can't tell from the picture, but it has an extra 'ring' that keeps it attached to the hitch even when the plug is not in the hitch... when you're using it to tow or to hold a rack.  This is a great bargain for the money and seems to be a genuine Mopar part. Keeps items from falling out on TT/RV I bought this item to keep my screen closed all the time and keep bugs out of the coach.  Product works well and was priced right. 
3M knows how to make sandpaper. When you get to 2000 grit you're really polishing. I use this prior to polishing something. Like all things 3M--it works & woks well This thing really cleans what you do not expect do get cleaned and even with ease. Try it and you'll know what I'm talking about. 
These caps fit on top of the Tri Lynx levelers (Tri Lynx 00015 (10)  Lynx Leveler) or by themselves, for under stabilizer jacks or the hitch jack (if you have a light trailer).  They can also be used on top of the levelers, for under the tire(s) to level your RV.  I don't know how much weight they can bare, but they do well with my 3,400lb trailer for all of the uses described above. I grew up in the 80's so I remember well playing with Legos.  Building everying from cars to forts.  Well the Tri Lynx Comapny has brought us back our nostalic youth with Tri Lynx Levelers.  These are large square plastic pads (roughly 9"x9"x1" thick) that are stackable to just about any confgiuration you can imagine.  You can stack them in a "column" fasion for leveling jacks.  Or you can stack them in an offset alternating "brick wall" fasion for an interlocking leveler that is safe to drive on without fear of displacement.  They can even be stacked side by side for larger duel wheel RVs.  For my use, I wanted to use them for my leveling jacks and for pads were there was a side leaning tilt.  The box says to never stack more than 4 levelers high for a single configuration.  I've gone to 10 under my jacks and they still feel rock solid once pressure is put on them.I'm on my 4th set of Lynx levelers.  I'm convinced you can't have too many.  With that I fianlly invested in these "Stop'n Chocks"  Wonderful!!!  As I said these can be used under your wheels as well.  So the Stop n' Chalk stacks as the last piece at the rear of the Lynx configuration to allow the driver  just back up against them.  Now these are the most versitle set of leveling / chalking pads you can buy becasue they allow for front to rear leveling and side to side leveling.  If one side of the coach is lower than the other, you can build up just that side and use standard chalks on the other.  Also if you have enough of the Tri Lynx levelers you could potentially place say 2" of lift under a front axel on an tandem configuration and 4 or even 5" under a rear.  The one draw back is that you would need enough to building this as one continous pad (say 8' long or so.)  But like legos, if you have enough, your imagination is the limit.A couple of notes:  You MUST use these in conjunction with TriLynx levelers.  They will not work on their own.  In addition there is a noctch carved out of the front to force the user to stack in the above mentioned "brick wall" alternating fasion so that there's no risk of sepertaion between the levels as the rig is driving on or off the pad.  Also, I stongly suggest a spotter!  Driving a rig on or off a 9" wide "rail" is dangerous and having someone to tell you that you a little too close to the edge is a must. Perfect for washing the RV...strong pole you can scrub as high as you need to go or can leverage. Holds its position when set.  Very pleased. 
This product is more of a glaze than a swirl remover.  While it does have some cutting ability it may not work well on new clear coat paint.  If you use this product I recommend to top it off with a good quality wax or sealant such as Meguiar's  Ultimate Wax.  (paste or liquid) This product was designed to make tires look new again without using the usual silicone based (make-um-shine) stuff which actually dries out your rubber trim. Though this product does contain some silicone it does not have as much as the stuff that it resembles. If you like your tires to look wet and shiny this product is not for you. If you want your tires to last longer and look new even when they no longer are, 3M Tire Dressing does just that. It is a good quality wax, but don't expect super shiny glossy finish from this wax. Basically it is just a cleaner wax and not anything exotic. 
This little gadget keeps my lift handle paired up nicely when mounted to my vehicle. It can get in the way when jacking, but it is easily solved by just pulling it up onto the d hook on the top. Does exactly what it is supposed to and you can use it without having to run around the vehicle to turn the water on and off. Keeps the pointy Greenfield kickstand from easily sinking into softer ground.  Installation is so easy even a caveman can do it. 
Does a super job on brass, copper, silver, aluminum, bronze and stainless steel. Polishes most metals to a mirror-like finish. Very similar to Flitz polishing cream. This is a pretty simple item.  Two standard SAE 12V bullet plugs and a wire between.  The reasons Ive docked a star are as follows:1) The cable gets fairly stiff in the cold.  Since tending seldom used batteries is often a winter capability, this is an important consideration.2) The metal connectors are not a shiny, bright metal like they were on the older connection accessories, but rather a galvanized or other coated metal that shows the effect of corrosion if used outdoors.  The connectors that have bright metal (stainless?) show no signs of corrosion after many years. WHEN TO USE EPOXY CEMENTWhen you need a strong rigid workable (e.g. sandable and/or paintable surface) adhesive, particularly for use on metal or hard plastic, epoxy is usually the best choice.  Most epoxies dry with little running or shrinkage, and so are good for filling gaps.  The major drawback to epoxies is that they consist of two parts (resin and hardener) which must be mixed in small batches, and then applied with your own applicator (e.g., a toothpick or popsicle stick). Some are packaged in a dual-syringe--but that is not an adequate solution, because the components must still be manually mixed in order harden to maximum strength.WHEN TO USE JB-WELDJB-Weld is a very strong epoxy cement.  JB-Weld is the cement/glue of choice when joining metal parts or filling holes in metals.  Otherwise, ordinary epoxy cement or other types of cements/glues are usually better choices.  Some other reviewers have complained that the descriptive name "weld" is inappropriate---to some extent that's true.  JB Weld can do some jobs welding can't.  Conversely some simple welding jobs like joining two thin metal rods at right angles are difficult with JB Weld.HOW TO USE JB-WELDGeneral Principles: Although JB WELD makes an excellent filler---and can even be used to cast small parts, it is not remotely as strong as real metal used this way.  Whenever possible, use JB WELD as an adhesive---a very thin layer of JB WELD holding two pieces of metal together.  Always reinforce with metal pieces when possible.  For example, rather than building up a massive flange with JB Weld, you might be able to use scrap peice of metal to form most of the flange, held in place with JB Weld.  The greater the relative surface area of contact, the strong the bond will be.Surface Preparation:  As with any adhesive, the surface must be clean and rough.  Clean with a solvent (according to another reviewer, acetone is the best solvent for this purpose, but rubbing alcohol will work), roughen the surface, then clean with the solvent again.  Use a clean cloth for each application of solvent.  I generally use a small grinding wheel in a Dremel tool to roughen the surfaces.  You can also scratch the surface with a knife, or use coarse sandpaper, or both depending on the material.The solvent cleaning is for removing the LAST TRACES of oil from CLEAN surfaces.  If the parts are oily, even multiple cleanings with solvent may not be enough---you may redeposit oil from your cleaning cloth or as the solvent evaporates on the surface.  So, if you can detect any oil on any portion of the part, or if you have any doubt, clean it with a degreaser first.  If you do not have a commercial degreaser handy, a paste of laundry detergent and a stiff brush may do the trick.  Only when you are certain that there are no traces of oil is it time for the solvent cleaning(s).Joining Broken Parts: If you are joining broken parts, with a clean but irregular matching surfaces, limit the roughening to scratching with a wire brush or etching with an acid (but be sure to wash off all traces of the acid). Apply a THIN uniform layer of JB WELD, lightly clamp together hard enough to squeeze out any excess. Sometimes a thick rubber band is perfect. Often you can arrange pieces so that the weight of the top piece will hold the joint together until the JB Weld cures. Sometimes you can place a weight (such as a brick) on top to apply gentle pressure.  Do not remove the clamp or pressure until the JB Weld has cured completely.  After an hour or two, after the glue has set but is still soft, you can cut off any excess with a knife or razor---but if you don't need to cut the excess off, don't.  Often you can build-up the surfaces around a break for added strength.  Sometimes blue painters tape can be used to help hold pieces together while the glue sets, and/or to make a temporary stand to hold the pieces in the best orientation.ScotchBlue Painter's Tape for Multi-Surfaces 2090-.75A, 3/4 Inches by 60 Yards, 1 RollJoining Dissimilar Parts:  Minimize any gaps if possible, e.g., by sanding if possible so that the contact as perfect as possible.  If you will be filling substantial gaps, sometimes it is helpful to cover openings with blue painters tape to prevent the JB Weld from flowing away and leaving gaps.Joining Long Thin Parts (rods or sheets): Try to overlap if possible, or reinforce them with a similar overlapping peice of metal glued in place with JB Weld.  To join a 1/8" steel rod, to another 1/8" steel rod, forming a "T" (a common and easy welding job, almost impossible with just JB-Weld), cut two 1"-long "L's" from a heavy-paper clip, (or make L's from similar wire), and embed those with JB-Weld on opposite sides of the joint.  You can further strenthen the joint by wrapping fine steel wire around the rods holding the "L"s in place---before  covering it all with JB-Weld.  Be sure to thoroughly clean the rods and wires first (see below).  For small parts, or when wire wouldn't work well, unwaxed dental floss is remarkably strong, and can do an excellent job of reinforcing joints (when embeded in JB Weld). Ideally, apply the JB Weld, then wind the floss tightly into the soft JB Weld.Filling Holes:  Don't forget to prepare the surfaces as described above---even if you can only roughen the surfaces with an ice pick or awl.  JB Weld shrinks very little as it cures so fill the hole completely.  If it is possible to sand the surface when the JB Weld has hardened, then overfill the hole slightly.  Since JB Weld flows a little until it sets, the surface should be horizontal.  If not horizontal, you can apply the JB Weld and then cover the hole with blue painters tape until the JB Weld sets.  Depending on the job, it is often a better strategy to fill the gap as much as possible with a piece (or pieces) of metal embedded in JB Weld that a single mass of pure JB Weld.Reinforcing a leaking pipe:  Work JB Weld into a piece of fiberglass cloth or with a spatula, apply, and then add more JB Weld to any thin spots and to feather out the edges. You may have to apply several layers of the JB Weld-saturated fiberglass cloth. Sometimes wire cloth (window screening) can be used.Holes in car body panels etc:  If you can cover at least one side of the hole with a piece of sheet metal (held in place by JB Weld) that is a good strategy---the combination of pop-rivets and JB Weld often works especially well, even if you ultimately sand the heads of the pop rivets away.TEKTON 6555 Rivet Gun with 40-pc. RivetsMixing:  Follow the instructions.  A paper plate can be a good mixing surface; popsicle sticks are the best mixing tools.  Beware that you must use the same amount of resin and hardener, and they MUST be VERY thoroughly mixed.  Mix until you are certain that it is completely and thoroughly mixed, and then continue mixing for twice that time.  Seriously!!!Curing:  Follow the instructions, but wait longer than recommended: the longer you wait the stronger the bond.  A a day or two at 70 or 80 degrees is a reasonable MINIMUM.  Note that epoxies do not "dry"--there are no solvents to evaporate, instead a chemical reaction hardens the cement (a plastic resin).  Chemical reactions are proportional to temperature (the rule of thumb is that for each 10 degrees, the reaction speed doubles).  Using the rule of thumb, if it takes 1 day to cure at 80 degrees, then it takes 16 days to cure at 40 degrees, and that's only to minimally cured.  Okay, I know that waiting this long is not practical in many circumstances---you can probably get away with curing for 4 hours at 90 degrees (but don't go much higher than 90 degrees), and "take it easy" for a couple of days.WHEN TO USE OTHER EPOXIESFor materials other than metal, particularly for rigid plastics, other epoxies are usually better than JB Weld.  Some epoxies are clear, or white, or specialized for particular purposes.  For exampleCLEARBOND H-3S Clear Strong Epoxy Adhesive Syringe - .85ozWHEN TO USE QUICK-EPOXIESOrdinary (slow) epoxies (whether JB Weld or other epoxies) dry harder than quick epoxies and are generally the best choice.  Maximum strength is the whole point of epoxies--if you don't need maximum strength---you probably do not need epoxy.  Use quick epoxies when 1) the hardening speed is essential, 2) when the item cannot be supported in the required orientation while the epoxy sets (at least several hours), or 3) when you have to absolutely minimize flowage.  Super-glue is often a good alternative in such situations.WHEN TO USE OTHER CEMENTS OR GLUESWhile epoxies are ideal for a few specific uses (primarily when you need a rigid cement for metal or rigid plastic)--there are many situations when other types of glue are better choices.  Epoxies are generally NOT recommended for flexible surfaces, such as leather, wood, or flexible plastic, and generally do not adhere well to glass, etc.  While epoxies may work with porous surfaces (paper, wood, ceramics, etc.), other adhesives are usually better.White Glue: For most light-duty indoor household applications which do not have to be waterproof, ordinary household white glue is safe, cleanup is very easy, and in most cases repairs are redo-able if you make a mistake.  White glue shrinks a great deal as it dries, and so is not good for filling holes or large gaps.  For example:Elmer's All Multipurpose White Glue, 7 5/8 oz. (E379)Glue Stick: Think of glue sticks as thick white household glue in stick form.  Glue sticks are great with paper, but have few other applications.Avery Glue Stic, 0.26 oz, Pack of 6, (98095)Wood Glue: Carpenters's wood glue is essentially water-proof (when dry) white household glue.  It penetrates and strengthens the wood better than any other type of glue. It is safe, and cleanup is easy. If the joint breaks again (because the wood is weak), it can be re-glued. For example:Elmer's E701 Carpenter's Wood Glue 8-OunceGoop:  Goop will bond virtually any material, including leather, plastics, glass, and metal.  The bond is clear, VERY strong, waterproof, and hard but flexible.  Since Goop is clear, if a little extra oozes out, it is barely noticeable. I've used Goop to repair ceramic plant pots, water hoses, and shoes; to seal holes in air-mattresses, to close small holes in window screens, as plumbers paste in assembling plumbing parts, to  I also use it to seal rust spots on my dishwasher rack--the Goop it also makes a "cushioned" surface that will prevent scratches to dishes.  Goop is particular good for repairing damaged electrical cords.Amazing Goop All-Purpose Household Goop, 3.7-Ounce Tube #130012Silicon Glue: Silicon glue is best for glass, and when you want a truly flexible connection (for example, to absorb vibrations). It is a good alternative for Goop for general household use on glass, plastic, and metal when you do not need the maximum possible strength. It is safer than Goop, and cleanup is easier. Like Goop, silicon glue takes days to reach reasonable strength, weeks to reach maximum strength. For example:GE Silicone II Household Glue, 2.8 ozFabric Glue:Beacon Fabri-Tac Permanent Adhesive, 4-Ounceworks amazingly well on fabrics, saturating the surfaces enough to provide a very strong bond, but without soaking through.  Depending on the application, fabric glue can be better than sewing.  It remains very flexible, e.g., it would probably be great on leather or heavy vinyl (e.g., women's handbags, shoes, luggage, etc.)Super-Glue (Krazy Glue): Super-glue is very strong, rigid, and fast. In many ways it is similar to 2-minute epoxy---except that no mixing is required. Although very hard, super-glue is brittle, and so, is not recommended for flexible objects. Super-glue is hazardous in that it can easily glue fingers (etc.) together.  Previously, I used super-glue frequently on objects (e.g., jewelry) when a clear bond was required---however, Goop is better for such applications, safer, and more conveneient. Opened super-glue keeps poorly, even in tighly sealed glass containers---so I recommended packages of multiple very small tubes.BAZIC Super Glue, 3 grams 0.10 ounces, 6 Per PackLiquid Nails/Construction Adhesive:  When you need to permanently join a large amount of surface, of almost any kind, Construction Adhesive is usually ideal. If you need to join 2 2x4s to make a 4x4 Construction Adhesive is better than nails.  Most construction adhesives are slightly flexible, and so can even be used on leather (i.e., to repair a loose shoe sole), etc.  Construction adhesive may leave a stain on porous surfaces, and may stain-through thin surfaces.  For small projects, Goop is usually a better choice.Caulking Compound:  You can think of caulking compound as white household glue with alot of inert filler--to use when you need to fill holes.  As an adhesive, it is the weakest on this list, but is strong enough for many purposes when spread over a large surface, such as the back of a ceramic tile.  A few years ago, I made a brick column to support a mailbox.  Traditionally, I should have used mortar--which would have been very time consuming.  I could have used construction adhesive (albeit any excess that squeezed out would have been ugly)--but caulking compound was quick, cheap, looks good, and was more than adequate for the job. 
In PA winter road salt causes rust on car frames - this product is a great solution. I tried Permatex because the spray-on rust sealant at the local auto parts store did not last. This product turns rust black and forms a hard protective coating that can be painted. After several months it appears to be holding up well. We are now painting over the treated frame areas with black spray paint. This also works on tools, lawn mowers, etc. Works great so far. Live in the north east so it has functioned in all types of weather so far. Make sure to spray a little WD40 in the cylinder to protect against rust This treatment works well to &#34;kill&#34; rust and should be used along with a good rust primer and top coat paint to prevent future reoccurrence of corrosion returning. This product essentially treats the rust as the surface of the metal becomes pitted and sanding or grinding does not remove all of it before painting. Good product to use in any area you do not want to continually do over. This product is an absolute must to have on the shelf for any auto or product used in high salt states such as in the Northeast area of the country. Small price to pay for an added layer of security to your rust prevention project. 
The door protector is the perfect size. thick enough to protect the door even if you open too hard. Other protectors are thinner. Easy to mount. You will need to provide your own screws. I needed a large funnel for adding an ammonia solution to a container for a diesel engine (DEF cannister) and did not want to try to empty a 2.5 gal container of the solution into the engine compartment and having the ammonia all over the place.The Hopkins funnel is large enough that it is an easy target for the liquid being used and it has a grip area so that if you have average size hands it is easy to hold on to it. If you have small hands the design is not going to work particularly well but it can be held by the rear section. As advertised everything that this thing claims it can do it will. Also the packaging was nice, big but nice. 
I now have 4 Battery Tenders, this being my 2nd Battery Tender Jr.  I use the larger models for 2 cars I store each winter, and I use the Jr. models for my generator and my lawn tractor.  Easy to use and work great, I've not yet needed to replace a battery after a storage season. I was looking for a general purpose multimeter for troubleshooting the starter on my 97 geo metro, I got this and I'm extremely satisfied with the product, I was able to check the voltage of the ignition switch and found that I had a faulty starter, I was able to get theDB Electrical SMT0054 Starter Chevy Metro 1.0L 1.3L 98 99 00 01 30005925and it worked great. I was also able to test the voltage on a coin battery, this product is great! Highly recommended! Hi All.I'm an RV'er, and have been for over 46+ years now.  So I am always looking for something for our Motorhome.  Having this adapter is great when you have Power, and you want to run 12 Volt items.  I'd buy another one in a second it needed.  Good Luck.  Happy Travels. 
Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.  The pickle fork is the last resort for me, as it will damage the balljoint boot.I prefer to use the Snap On balljoint remover.  If that one cannot fit, then I will try this tool.  If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork. I would not buy this product again. It does what it should but If I had to do it again I would just stick with detaling microfiber towels from Viking/Cobra. I hope I never have to use this but if I do I'm sure it will perform fine. The hammer point should break glass just fine and the seat belt cutter should work too. 
The kit makes cleaning the K&N filters so much easier and cuts through the grease and grime better then average soaps without leaving a residue behind. This product fit perfectly on the oil filter cover on my 2011 Lexus RCX350  . This one works great, and makes changing oil a breeze.  Make sure you use synthetic 0W20, get an OEM filter element, proper plastic drain plug, and your ready to change your oil in less than 20 minutes.  On a Lexus, you will save at least $150 (after buying the oil and needed parts/tools). Was able to purchase the 5.1qt jug for ease of oil changing.  My SLK230 takes right around the 5.1qt mark and this is much easy to pour in new over opening five separate containers of 0W-40.  I did find this at Walmart a bit cheaper but was convenient to recieve all my car parts bundled together from Amazon. 
Schumacher SEM-1562A 1.5 Amp Speed Charge MaintainerWell worth the price...does exactly what it is suppose to do.(Update) After using this charger less than 5 mos. to maintain my R.V., which is seldom driven, I have found that, because of the charger failing to cycle back to the charge mode properly, the battery that it was hooked to was stone dead. Now, I'll do some research to find out the annoying process of returning the charger for warranty.(Update) I have contacted the manufacturer, Schumacher, concerning the failure of this charger but after 3 weeks, have received no response and it doesn't look like I am going to. So, I guess I'll just take the loss of making a bad choice and trash it. BTW, I am using two Chicago Electric on Board chargers, one on my Jeep and the other on my Mercury Sable. Both are giving very good service and are less expensive than the Schumacher or the Battery Tender. I wound up spending $200 or more replacing my Vent Valve Solenoid, purge valve and Evap Canister because I was sold a defective AcDelco GT276 gas cap. I got the dreaded p0400 code and learned the first thing to check is the gas cap. Bought the Delco brand because of the tassle and hoped that it would be the same as the oem cap. Well, it's not!After replacing the gas cap and getting the same code a couple weeks later, I began to try and troubleshoot the EVAP system and quickly learned that it is a booger...After spending the time and money to replace the above mentioned parts and continuing to get the SES light and monitoring results thru my system/code reader, I turned my focus back to the Gas Cap. I had noticed that the tension on the cap before it began to click wasn't even as strong as the old oem cap I had replaced. At my wits end , I decided to go ahead and purchase the STANT brand gas cap and give it a shot. I read some good reviews about Stant. The new cap arrived and the tension and fit on it was 10 times better than this cap. After replacing with the Stant cap, I monitored the cars system and it PASSED the EVAP check. At that time I felt relieved that I found my problem, but I was also peeved that I had spent $200 on other parts because of this defective cap. So I would advise anybody out there to buy a Stant instead..... Oh, and the Delco is made in Germany Plews Lub hand pump. Works just fine to refill Dual Pump Fluid in my Honda CRV. Must for service every 15,000 miles. 
Can't say anything bad about the gun -- well constructed and built to last a lifetime. However, I see what people are talking about with the instructions. They're not really instructions. No parts labeled, nothing but a drawing of the unit itself, and another small diagram showing the spring release pulled back and locked. Other than that, the instructions literally consist of one 107-word run-on sentence that leaves you scratching your head. So just don't even read it, just throw it in the trash unless you want to laugh. It works well for a few days and after that I have to dump my tank and deposit more Bio-Paks. I just don't know, I may be doing something wrong. But, I don't think so because I am following the directions on the package. If any one has some tips please post them.................... I am not a good mechanic, I don't even pretend to play one on TV. Mostly I am somebody who is sick of paying $80 to the local mechanic to find out the gas cap is cracked or some $10 part needs to be replaced. I finally decided to buy a code scanner to facilitate my repair efforts.---THE GOOD STUFF---* The unit worked right out of the box on both my 2006 Subaru Outback and my 2002 Jeep GC. The hardest part of the whole deal was finding the port on the Subaru. (Tip-look under the hood release).* There seems to be a whole INNOVA website that they want you to go to for help translating the numeric codes into English. So far typing every code I have seen into Google has brought back more information than I know how to use. Not sure how this works for more serious mechanics who might need access to technical bulletins, but for us Saturday morning driveway hackers, it is fine.* The unit seems reasonably well made, although not sure it would stand up to the day-to-day use of a professional. For us "couple times a year" mechanics, it seems fine.---THE NOT SO GOOD STUFF---* There are no directions included, only a CDROM. The CD doesn't even have the directions, but points you to a website. Actually it doesn't even do that, instead it loads an application onto your computer and the app has a link built into it to get you to the website. Kind of convoluted and time wasting.* Plugging the scanner into your USB port kicks off the loading of a driver. No warning, and no idea what it loaded. I hate that.* The box could really do with a quick-start guide. Really all you need to know is how to plug it in, when to power (not start) the vehicle, and what the little buttons do. Would fit on an index card. Instead it is a 15 minute software deal.---SUMMARY---It seems fine for what I want it to do, namely just scan codes quickly. The whole PC/CDROM could have just as soon been skipped. For my use, no reason at all to plug it into the computer, and the installed app just looks like trouble.Ideally a quick-start guide, or better yet, some abbreviated instructions printed on the back, would have made this so much easier for a first time scanner user. That is the reason for the 4 stars and not 5.No idea how robust the unit is, or how long it will last, but I will probably lose it or drop it before it "wears out". 
a regular 32mm socket will not fit in the space of my equinox. this is a kind of shorter 32mm socket designed only for oil filter cap job. it works fine. This is designed to work with the Valterra bayonet fitting on your Gray or Black water dump valve and it does just that... Works as needed, only problem is it will only fit a standard oil jug not the gallon. 
This fits my 2004 Lexus RX330 perfectly. IMHO I feel that thisplain paper is superior to "carbon" type filters. How long can athin sprinkling of "carbon" last? Plus you can easily see howdirty the filter actually is and replace accordingly.  A good value. Great to be able to buy a six pack of oil from Amazon.  This is great oil and I use it in a European car that requires this from the factory specs. This 30W non-detergent oil is what you should use in your 4 cycle lawn mower or garden tractor.I have a garden tractor with a 26 HP Kohler engine and this 48oz is exactily how much the engine uses when you change the oil and filter. I like not having left over new oil. That lets me use the container for the used oil.  Ordering was convenient and shipping was fast. 
This tool is perfect for solo bleeding brakes. All you do is attach it to a bottle/jar/container via some adapters and tubing and then bleed away without the fear of getting air back into the brake lines.The only tiny problem is that the tubing attached to the bleeder screw is a air tight one way check valve so when you take it off a large amount of brake fluid is trapped on the intake side of the tube and if your not careful may make quite a mess on the calipher. I wish they included some button on the tool to open the check valve fully to allow the excess fluid trapped in the tubing to flow downward into the container to minimize the chances to make a mess. This was a bit loose on my grease gun, and a bit awkward to get fastened. An OK product, not exciting but serviceable. It does allow hanging the grease gun with some placement precision. Very well constructed but it has a design flaw that makes it useless. The internal plunger has a disc with a slot and the T handle needs to engage the disc perfectly or the rod pushes into the grease and not the disc so the grease does not load properly. I have 4 other standard grease guns and these work perfectly but I wanted the pistol grip so I could pump with one hand.I have not idea what the intended purpose is in having the rod disengage from the plunger disc as this is unique in my experience to the Lincoln grease gun. 
Great price, better than local HW store.Product is a rather large bottle and if ordered from a prime vendor, will come quickly This fits my 1998 323is, but Amazon shows it as not compatible.  However, the same filter from other suppliers on Amazon show as compatible.  So check other sites for the part number that fits your vehicle.This is a good price and convenient with Amazon Prime.  I used to have to plan weeks ahead for oil changes to wait for it to arrive, or keep a spare on hand. This was a fraction of the price of the ones at the store and fit perfectly for my 2004 Lexus RX 330 AWD. 
I am satisfied with this product, and what it does, because we all know how rust is and if we don't, let me say it can be a pain in the but you know what i'm trying to say, so to expect miracles would be beyond expectations.will use again. Never used one of these before so and the instructions are a little confusing so I did not know how to use it. I looked up YouTube and found out how to use it and it works fine. I probably should compare it to another to see how accurate it is, but I really like how easy it is to use and turns off and on by itself. 
It works well for a few days and after that I have to dump my tank and deposit more Bio-Paks. I just don't know, I may be doing something wrong. But, I don't think so because I am following the directions on the package. If any one has some tips please post them.................... I probably should compare it to another to see how accurate it is, but I really like how easy it is to use and turns off and on by itself. The open tube of other brands has a short pot life. I buy this one because I get to use the whole tube no matter how long it takes.The tube also is stronger and you don't end up with a handful of stuff coming out where it is not supposed to.I buy this brand in quantity as I know that down the road when I open a new tube the stuff will be the same as the one I just finished. 
When researching what to do to make my car paint smooth as glass, I found this clay kit.  Works wonders, especially on weathered finishes.  Test your paint surface for roughness (everyone's has some) by putting your hand in a plastic baggie and wipe it over your car paint.  If it feels rough, which it should, then Meguiar's Clay Detailer is the cure!  Using the spray as a lubricant, the clay is rubbed along the paint surface removing bonded contaminants which cannot be removed by washing alone (tar, etc.).  I love it! I learned about Gold Clay Bars in a Honda CRV forum, where car enthusiasts shared their favorite products.This was three years ago. Since then I clay my car twice a year, in the spring  and the the fall.I just finished my spring treatment when a fellow walked by my car and asked if this was 2011 CRV that I waswashing.  I told him it was almost 4 years old and he could not believe it.  I have toadmit that the car does look like new with much of the credit to regular claying and using back-to-blackon plastic parts.I should mention that I store Gold Clay in a plastic container which used to contain onion dip.  This keeps it pliable and clean.  It is a bit strange that the container for clay did not come with the package.  If clay dries out it will stop working. And it is sticky, so if you leave it without some sort of container it will pick up dirt that could scratch the car the next time you use it.Claying system removes contaminants that attach themselves to the car. Clay does not polish the car or remove any paint of finish, so it is totally safe to the finish if used properly (i.e. with plenty of lubrication).The clay material (which feels like play-doh)makes the small particulars that are deposited on the car finish attach themselves to the clay and get lifted from the car finish. Clay needs to be used with heavy lubrication, which Showtime Instant Detailer, included in this package, provides.I start by washing my car. I don't dry it as this time as water drops will be removed by other steps. Then I clay the car. I don't clay every inch of the entire car. I just examine the car by sight for any imperfections and by my running my hand over the paint to feel any tiny bumps. When I feel some grittiness or see some dirt on the paint, I generously spray that section with Showtime Instant Detailer, then knead the piece of clay in my hand and rub it against the spot I identified. Normally, you see the dirt disappear in a few swipes.  Sometimes you need to reapply the Detailer and repeat.  Kneading is important as you want to work the little pieces of dirt into the clay, and not leave it on the surface of the clay ball where it can scratch the car. This year we had a rough winter and I had some rubber marks from my snow removal tool in addition to the regular dirt specs.  Clay did a great job on removing those marks.I also use the clay on non-painted areas such as glass and chrome. It does a great job as well. After the claying step I wax the car is small sections.Mothers 05701 California Gold Carnauba Cleaner Wax Liquid - 16 ozAs my final step I apply Back-to-blackMothers 06108 Back-To-Black - 8 ozto non-painted surfaces. This turns the dull plastic into shiny new looking surface.  Back-to-black is also effective in removing any wax that might have accidently got on the plastic, that's why I do back-to-black as the last step. I just finished my first spring washing when a fellow walked by my car and asked if this was 2011 CRV that I waswashing. I told him it was almost 4 years old and he could not believe it. I have to admit that the car does look like due to wonderful Mothers products and some elbow grease.Mothers Carnauba Wax is one of the weapons in keeping my car looking good.I start by washing my car. I don't dry it as this time as water drops will be removed by other steps. Then I clay the car to remove embedded specs, stuck on dirt, and this year I had rubber marks from clearing the snowMothers 07240 California Gold Clay Bar Paint Saving System. I don't clay every inch of the entire car. I just examine the car by sight for any imperfections and by my running my hand over the paint to feel any tiny bumps. When I feel some grittiness or see some dirt on the paint, I generously spray that section with Mothers Showtime Instant Detailer, then knead the piece of clay in my hand and rub it against the spot I identified. Normally, you see the dirt disappear in a few swipes. Sometimes you need to reapply the Detailer and repeat. Kneading is important as you want to work the little pieces of dirt into the clay, and not leave it on the surface of the clay ball where it can scratch the car. I also use the clay on non-painted areas such as glass and chrome if they have stains.After the claying step I wax the car is small sections using Carnauba Wax. It easy to work with.  I put it on a small section (each side of the car is done in 4 sections, for example), by the time I am done spreading it, it is ready to be wiped off, you don't have to wait.  I use micro fiber towels to wipe the wax, using a fresh piece of the fiber on each section.As my final step I apply Back-to-blackMothers 06108 Back-To-Black - 8 ozto non-painted surfaces. This turns the dull plastic into shiny new looking surface. Back-to-black is also effective in removing any wax that might have accidently got on the plastic, that's why I do back-to-black as the last step.Carnauba Wax gives a superior shine.  It is easy and pleasant to work with.  I highly recommend it. 
have not in stalled this product yet but looks like it will do exactly what i need it to do. I don't have much to say about it. Its a filter. Don't notice any extra &#34;freshness&#34; to the air. I had an old filter and it didn't smell, so this one doesn't add any extra benefit to me. I'll probably just stick to the cheaper filter next time. Definitely change these yourself. DO NOT let your oil change guys do it for you. Look up your car on Youtube and type is cabin filter replacement. I'm sure you'll find a simple step by step video on how to do it yourself. I'm guessing you'll save $30+ I haven't used them yet but they look good and it will do what I need. I need to wash my car I guess 
Great clay bar kit that anyone can use, includes two large clay bars, microfiber towel, and clay lube spray. Meguiar's Clay kit took the bugs ground into the front of my 2011 GMC Terrain without marring the surface. Very solid product. I use these pads for final polishing and sealant application.  Yes, I flat out love these pads.  Oh yeah.After washing and cleaning the paint surface with the proper compound, I follow up with Ultra Cut and sealant, both of which I apply using this pad.  Surface prep listed below:1. Wash with Meguiar's Gold Class Car Wash.2. Clean surface with Ryobi, 6&#34; orbital sander and 6&#34; terry cloth pad combined with Meguiar's &#34;Ultra Cut Compound&#34; or &#34;Medium Cut Cleaner.&#34;3, Polish surface with Ryobi, 6&#34; orbital sander, with Hook-Loop Velcro strips attached to pad and polish with &#34;Ultra Finishing Polish&#34; applied using a 6.5&#34; soft foam polishing pad; the yellow 6.5&#34; foam pad.4. Finish using the yellow, 6.5&#34; soft foam polishing pad.  The Synthetic Sealant goes on very easy and with a micro cloth, comes off equally easy and leaves a very satisfying shine.Warning: due to splatter factor, make sure to smear Ultra Finishing Polish and Synthetic Sealant onto the surface before turning the dual action (DA) buffer on.After taking the time to wash and clean the surface of the paint with Ultra and/or Medium Cut Compound, applying Ultra Finishing Polish and Synthetic Sealant to the paint is pleasure as with this pad, it goes on very nicely.(all compounds, polishes and sealants are removed with clean micro fiber cloths.)In my opinion, for final polish or sealant application, these pads are the bomb. 
I used this pad with the Porter Cable buffer and Astro Pneumatic 4607 5" PU Velcro Backing Pad to apply Meguiar's Ultra Finishing Polish and it worked great. This pad is easy to clean. After buying the Meguiars DA Polisher and the "frequently bought together deal" including the 6.5" finishing pad and the 6.5" polishing pad I found out directly from Meguiars that they have updated the pads to 7" which include a recess to make centering the polisher's backing pad easier AND have improved the Velcro backing pad adhesive so that the new 7" pads are actually machine washable.  The Velcro pad is attached far more securely.  The older 6.5" pads often lose their Velcro backing due to washing/cleaning.There is no doubt in my mind that the pad material is of high quality on either the new 7.0"  or this older 6.5" pad, it's just that Meguiar's has improved and updated their pads now.  The recess on the back of the pad definitely aids the user in centering the pad, that one feature alone makes buying the 7.0" pad a no-brainer.  Combine that with the improved backing pad adhesive and now we have a slam dunk.Here are the links for the newest and improved pads:SOFTBUFF 2.0 FOAM POLISHING PAD 7 inchMeguiar's W 9207 7" Soft Buff 2.0 Foam Finishing Pad This pad and the yellow polishing pad are perfect. Cell foam material is durable, wash and reuse. This pad worked perfectly on my Home Depot's Ridgid Random Orbital Sander with the hook and loop pad. Don't spend $140+ on a so called "car" random orbital polisher. The Ridgid is basically the same thing...yet only costs $60 and I can use it for home improvement work after my car is done. Meguiar's Scratch X 2.0 also works good with this pad to remove minor scratches and blemishes. Use Ultimate Compound for heavier oxidization. 
Good product!! Great product. This product is very good but not great. It's their consumer grade polishing glaze and their professional line is really great! A good product at a very reasonable price. 
I bought two sets of Braxton seat covers: A tan set, and this grey set.  They both fit well and look good.Installation was easier than I expected.  Not surprisingly, they were much easier to slide over the leather seats.  It wasn't hard getting them on my cloth seats, just a bit more difficult.  On the up side, they don't slip around as much on the cloth seats.The seat covers have a little flap that you have to wedge through the gap where the seat bottom meets the seat back.  That flap has holes in it.  The bottom of the seat cover, near the back, has an elastic band on each side, with a plastic hook on the end.  (Two extra hooks are also included with each cover, affixed in a little bag to the inside of the seat cover bottom.)  After sliding the seat cover into place and getting the flap through that gap, you attach the hooks to the holes in the flap.The hardest part of installation wasn't the fault of the seat covers, but because of how my Sonata's seats are designed.  The cloth on the seat back extends past the gap where the seat back meets the seat bottom.  There are a couple hidden straps that hook the cloth to the underside of the seat.  Once I figured out how to unhook that, I was able to access the flaps of the seat covers, and finish installation.I got two slightly different "versions" of the Braxton seat covers.  My grey set is, according to the date on the box, a few years older than the tan set.  The flap on the older seat covers is a simple flap with two holes in it.  The tan set I have has flaps with four holes in them, and the end of the flaps also have a spongy, cylindrical insert in them.  This insert is presumably intended to help keep the seat cover in place.  The additional holes must be to accommodate different seat designs.  I found both changes (the extra holes and the spongy insert) completely needless, but maybe on some vehicles they would be helpful.  The spongy insert did (of course) make it harder to get the flap through the gap in the seat.In short, these seat covers fit smoothly in both my cars.  They look quite good and they don't slide around enough to be a problem.  They make leather seats more comfortable year-round, and they help keep sweat and dirt off cloth seats.Be sure to check your owner's manual before installing seat covers. Some vehicles have air bags built into the seats, and any kind of covering could impede air bag function. (In fact, the aforementioned Sonata has air bags built into the seats, and I had to stop using these covers in that car.)Recommended! After buying the Meguiars DA Polisher and the "frequently bought together deal" including the 6.5" finishing pad and the 6.5" polishing pad I found out directly from Meguiars that they have updated the pads to 7" which include a recess to make centering the polisher's backing pad easier AND have improved the Velcro backing pad adhesive so that the new 7" pads are actually machine washable.

Combine that with the improved backing pad adhesive and now we have a slam dunk.Here are the links for the newest and improved pads:SOFTBUFF 2.0 FOAM POLISHING PAD 7 inchMeguiar's W 9207 7" Soft Buff 2.0 Foam Finishing Pad I prefer this pad over the one supplied with my Porter Cablr Polisher.  Its really soft and works into the corners and tight places easily.  This is also my favorite pad of all the Megs pads as its the easiest to work. 
I have two cars, both of which require the large #14 sheet metal self-tapping screws to mount the plate to the nylon retainers behind the plate (the ones mounted on the car that the screws screw into). Problem is that diameter of the plastic ring that holds the screw covers is too small to take the screw's large diameter head. The maximum screw head diameter that will fit the ring is .435 inch (11 millimeters). Option 1: Replace the nylon retainers on the car, but different cars have different retainers so one must search for new ones that will accept a #12 screw. Option 2: Try to find #14 self-tapping screws with smaller heads. I shopped around for #14 screws with smaller heads to no avail. Option 3: Grind down the screw head's diameter. Option 4 (not good): On one car I used #12 sheet metal screws that have a smaller diameter, but DO fit the rings, and wrapped the threads with tape. This sort of works, but I really can't tighten them down satisfactorily. So I have to check their security now and then. I'm leaving the other car as is for now. Maybe someone has more practical ideas? Sure would like to hear of them. BTW, SEE THE UPDATE BELOW.UPDATE 11/16/13:I think I've found a viable solution to the above problem. I used a #12 sheet metal self-tapping screw, placed a 1/2-inch long piece of ordinary shrink tubing (1/4" i.d.) over the threads towards the pointed end of the screw. Used a heat gun (or you can use a match, BIC lighter or soldering iron) to shrink the tubing which effectively increases the thread diameter to about that of a #14 screw. This allows me to tighten the screw securely and will last much longer than ordinary tape. One more thing: The THICKNESS of the screw head doesn't quite allow the chrome cap to fully snap into place over the nylon ring. The top of the head needs to be filed down a little leaving enough Philips "X" to use the screwdriver. There are two horns, not one. One is 400Hz and the other one is 500Hz.PIAA | Automotive Sports Horn (400/500Hz) #85110The are exact fits on the mounts as the OEM horns and use the same bolts. A 1/4 inch drive ratchet and a 12mm socket is needed to remove and install the bolt. They came with grounding leads with ring spade lugs that mounted readily under the existing M6 bolts on the radiator supports. All you need is a 10mm socket.The two wiring harness leads are too short to connect the horns. Two wire tie mounts hold the harness to the aluminum bumper reinforcement. You can cut off the ties and use the OEM harness to connect the horns, but I chose not to.  I prefer NOT to cut off the OEM connector blocks.I made two pigtail extensions out of 18 gauge black primary wire, 5 inches long. One end needs a 1/4 inch wide exposed male quick disconnect. The other end needs an insulated female 1/4 inch quick disconnect terminal. Since I used 18 gauge wire, I used the red coded ones.The exposed male connector slides into the OEM horn connector perfectly. The female one clips easily onto the positive terminal of each horn.The horns how have a weather shield on the apertures.Best thing to my surprise is that they appear to be very high quality and Made in Japan.Also nice is that they need no modification to the horn relay or circuit. This is a plastic sandwich type holder for the flat 4 wire connector.  Not only did my connector fit loose and tilt at an angle as a result, but the holder did not have a proper channel to fit the cover for the 4 wire connector I just bought. The channel provided for the cover is very small and is evidently application specific. This was a waste of money.  I had to buy a different mounting bracket from a trailer place. 
This is great, nice color yellow and banana scented to match the color and make applying the wax more pleasent. Spreads very easily and also great value.So remember, this is one of Meguiar's cheapest waxes, so you should not expect it to do as much as the more expensive ones such as gold class, nxt gen and ultimate wax, I love taking care of my vehicles.  I have used many expensive, imported products over the years.  However, Meguiar's keeps winning me back with their incredible offerings.  They are of high quality, effective, easy to find, and affordable.  However, take the affordable off.  I'd use their products, if they were 3x the price because I've used products that cost that much and are less effective.Meguiar's NXT Generation Tech Wax 2.0 highlights that experience.  I didn't want to like this wax/sealant as much as ones I paid thirty, forty, or fifty dollars to buy.  However, the results were obvious. On my vehicles, this is the best wax/sealant I have ever used.For optimum results I strongly encourage you before apply NXT 2.0, clay your car, clean with a paint cleaner (i.e. Scratch X or Deep Crystal Step 1), polish with a pure polish (Deep Crystal Step 2 or #7 Show Car Polish), and then apply this wax.  The results are truly remarkable.To maintain your shine, remove loose dirt and contaminants with Quick Exterior Detailer, or Ultimate Exterior Detailer.Meguiar's keeps delivering the good stuff, and I'm a fan. I love taking care of my vehicles. I have used many expensive, imported products over the years. However, Meguiar's keeps winning me back with their incredible offerings. They are of high quality, effective, easy to find, and affordable (while being as good as expensive boutique products in the opinion of many "car crazy," people like myself).Meguiar's Gold Class Liquid Wax is another example of that experience. Meguiar's effectively markets this wax and who doesn't love using something called Gold Class that comes in beautiful packaging? However, it is not smoke and mirrors. Inside the tin is a very good wax that will greatly enhance your paint's finish, while providing all-important protection.Today, liquid waxes tend to be more popular, and Gold Class is certainly available in liquid.  Both versions are the same formula and provides the same benefits and results according to Meguiar's.  However, call me old fashioned, but there is something about applying a paste wax that I enjoy.  I find it fun, and the tin and packaging of this paste wax is really gorgeous.  It feels like something that is valuable and of the highest quality.  I like that!For optimum results I strongly encourage you before you apply Gold Class, to clay your car (Meguiar's Smooth Surface Clay Kit works great), clean with a paint cleaner (i.e. Deep Crystal Step 1), optionally polish with a pure polish (Deep Crystal Step 2 or #7 Show Car Polish), and then apply this wax. The results are truly remarkable. Again, I have used many waxes to top off my detailing, and Gold Class is one I keep going back to. It's one of my favorites and one of the best.To maintain your shine between washings and detailing, remove loose dirt and contaminants with Quick Detailer, or Ultimate Quick Detailer.Meguiar's keeps delivering the good stuff, and I'm a fan. 
This paste wax is a great wax when added with a long lasting cleaning wax to have the perfect shine and protection of your cars paint. This wax can be used on modern cars' plastic headlight assy.While this is one of the best waxes available, I'm switching to Zonyl/Teflon wax as they produce much better shine. I used Zym&ouml;l Z503 on a newer vehicle that had minor contaminants in the finish.One characteristic that is important to note about Zym&ouml;l is that you need to be a bit more synchronized w/ its application - it dries really fast compared to other cleaner waxes I've used.This cleaner wax requires more effort to buff clean. The extra amount of elbow-grease required resulted in a superior shine.PROS:1. natural formula2. solid reputation3. provides intense 'wet' shine4. cleans off concrete easily (inevitable drip or two on the garage floor)5. smells like tropical paradiseCONS:1. very thin consistencyI'm not sure if the Zym&ouml;l Z503 is the same formula that I've used in years past, that said I'll wait a while to evaluate how long the protective finish lasts. 
This drain works good but is starting to corrode. It really should be made from stainless steel or even plastic. I have a brushed titanium finish bike with polished aluminum components, and this polish works well on both metals.I also used it to polish the brushed stainless steel exhaust tips on my car, with very good results. Good quality R.V. water heater drain valve. Brass construction with a steel finger tip handle built in. A vital component when winterizing or just performing general maintenance. Teflon tape will seal threads upon install. Great replacement for older leaking or rusty valves. 
I used this wax on my Platinum Gray VW and the surface had a near perfect mirror reflection.  I will continue to use this wax I use this stuff to shine the chrome on my motorcycle. I also like to use it to polish feed ramps on shootin irons. I have a dark colored car, so I purchased one of those "black" tinted spray waxes which claimed it also cleans and shines black plastic and metal trim.  Wrong.  I also use a regular (not black) liquid spray polish detailer.  It's okay on regular black plastic and window trim surfaces.But neither could clean the paste wax residue ruining the look of the textured black plastic on top of my rear bumper.  But Mothers Back-to-Black certainly did.  Now my car looks showroom new again.The product is a cream colored liquid (not black).  So my product applicator (an old sock) and my wiping cloth (an old t-shirt, both from my husband) aren't stained.  I'm very happy and I would I highly recommend this product to everyone. 
Lately, there seems no difference between polishing compound/rubbing compound. The latter used to refer to very coarse material but this no longer seems true.I use this compound mostly on plastics and it can remove residual adhesive, scratches, etc... It can also be used to polish clear coat layer on metallic paint. Paint whatever with metallic paint first, then spray a few layers of clear paint (gloss). Wait a day or two to completely dry and lightly polish with this compound & soft cloth. You'd be happy with the result. I did my brake calipers last summer with this vht spray and still have awesome results. I love and highly recommend this product.Steps u did for my results, brake cleaner, sprayed 1 coat primers on each caliper, let dry than 2 coats of vht red with 15-20min between each coat, 2 coats of clear on each.Long lasting professional resultsHighly recommend you take your timeIf it gets on the car use a clay bar I decided to try this polish after using both Turtle Wax & Mothers on most ofmy previous cars and to date I have had no regrets.Meguiar's NXT Generation Tech Wax 2 is very simple to apply and goes on easilyand also wipes off effortlessly without leaving any white waxy residue; it providesgood protection.It gives a clean bright, deep, long-lasting, beautiful shine to my black 2011 Nissan Tiida;in addition it leaves the surface smooth and glossy. 
Have used for years. It is the best car wash going. Removes the dirt, bugs and road grime, but, but leaves your wax on the car. cleans very well removes brake dust and stuck on grime..need to spray on and let soak scrub with brush..hose off..if stains are old or been on rims for awhile you will have to do a second clean but it will remove 95% of grime Used this to clean the vinyl in the interior of a 2011 Corvette that was supposed to be charcoal but had developed a chalky white nasty residue since delivered new from Bowling Green. This cleaner, sprayed on to a microfiber towel, removed all of it very easily and the best part is that it left no residue on the vinyl. It is alcohol based so don't spray it all over the place inside the car, spray on towel then clean. I then applied a coat of Meguiars Protectant Natural Shine with a sponge and wiped excess and the color is now a low luster (no gloss) charcoal that is beautiful as it was intended. 
This paste wax is a great wax when added with a long lasting cleaning wax to have the perfect shine and protection of your cars paint. It is a good quality wax, but don't expect super shiny glossy finish from this wax. Basically it is just a cleaner wax and not anything exotic. Used these pads with a Ryobi polisher and the Meguiar's Ultimate Compound, Polish and NXT 2.0 wax. Cleaned with some Simple Green and warm water in a bucket and they're good as new. 
I bought this converter so as to use my &#34;Snap&#34; sat radio in my truck in the garage. The snap radio is used in the 12v power supply in my truck and to be able to use elsewhere I decided to try this out. Plus if need be it can be used as a cell phone charger. I have not used it enough to comment on quality but I have 2 other Schumacher products that are high quality. I see no reason why this product would be any different. This big strong board is another Camco product for RV's that Amazon offers. It is fantastic, stores out of the way and can be used to clean fish or game outdoors. I've been using Red Line Products for years. This transmission oil is the only one you can safely use in classic British sports cars. Highly recommended. 
I required an ammonia-free window cleaner for my tinted windows. This does the job quite nicely. It isn't how well it does, rather how safely it does it. Does just what is says it will do.  It makes filling the fresh water tank less messy, simple as that. Fits your standard 12&#34; buckets and works as described. This really does help settle all of the grit and muck from washing. If only there was a way to always have perfectly clear water to wash my car to begin with! 
I have read about this wax for the past couple months on detailers forum.  I thought I would give it a try and all I can say is why; did I not know about this wax years ago?  This is amazing.  It leaves a clean slick surface on a silver car that it makes the surface look like glass.  After three washes the slick surface is still there and I find myself staring at my car, I know it sounds silly.  Yes you do need to prep the paint surface (clay, polish).  Then apply two coats of this wax and be prepared to be amazed. The benefits of this wax are that it goes on and comes off like butter, and leaves a nice, deep shine.  The problem with it is that it doesn't LAST LONG.  I just waxed my Truck 5 weeks ago and the water isn't beading off anymore.  It only rained once here and while i've done a couple of washes since the wax, my car wash soap (meguiars or mothers) won't strip off any wax.  So while this product looks great, it's only lasted about a month...that isn't gonna cut it.  I'm not waxing my truck 12 times a year.  I've read great things about the newly released Ultimate Liquid wax which has the newest in wax technological advances and has some amazing polymer properties...so I bought 2 bottles of it and will wax sometime in the next couple of weeks.  Per Meguiar's, they say that the ultimate liquid wax will out-last ANY of their other waxes and because of the newest advances in the wax formula itself,...I'm anxious to use it.  Once I do, rest assured i'll be leaving a review for that too.  All in all this tech wax 2.0 is a good wax but just doesn't last long. I used this to seal paint on an old corvette painted 16 years ago that was still in good shape. I polished the finish first and used this as final step to seal/protect finish. I used an electric polishing wheel to apply this and removed after about 15 minutes or so as recommended with a microfiber cloth by hand. I think I have used just about every wax and polish ever made and am happy with the glossy shine this sealer leaves. also when removing this it doesnt leave any dust or powder residue like most waxes do. I cant attest to how long shine lasts yet since I just applied this product today. 
Great for bikes. Not for cars. It doesn't hold much, but it's low enough and it's designed to have the capture cone on the corner, so you can fit it for bikes.Other than that, I can't imagine having this tiny thing for car oils. It works for both my bike and my car, because my car is tiny 4 banger and it doesn't hold too much oil. These fit nicely against the tires and do a nice job of holding the car.  They stack for easy storage. the tire pressure gage is easy to read and  use, is small enough to carry in your pocket,  saddle bag, or glove box if using the gage for car or truck. Angled tip works well for motorcycle tires. 
I have mixed feelings about these bags. I replaced a set of Dowco teardrop shaped sport saddlebags with these. The Dowco's held more stuff and were fairly waterproof, even without the rain covers. I bought these bags in order to match the tail bag I had purchased, since they were a "system" but let me tell you... these things are not nearly as "water resistant" as they are advertised to be. In fact, without the built in day-glo rain covers (which ARE nice to have), these bags allow even the lightest sprinkling of rain in. You better use a waterproof liner if you have anything that needs to be kept dry. IF you have enough forewarning to put the rain covers on, you're good but get caught in a sudden down pour and your stowed gear is damp, at the least. Over all, for the price (and for the fact that all my soft-sided luggage now matches) I'd say it was a good buy. Just be aware of the weather and if you even THINK it's going to rain, deploy the rain covers. I haven't had a chance to use them in the rain but for normal riding they are very good.  Easy to put on with the two zippers and they seem to have a complete liner that is waterproof.  Comfortable too.  They are not SIDI or BMW quality but for the price are fine.This was added after a 4 hour ride in the rain.  This boot is a rain magnet, I had so much water in these it could be dumped out.  I need to change these to NO STARS as the main point of buying a waterproof boot is to have it be water-proof and these are NOT.  Don't buy these if you want any sort of water resistance or water proofing as they are bad for that. I've always had great experiences with Meguiar's products. This stuff works great and I used it on a Black car. A black car is very hard to keep the paint looking show room. I've used Detailing spray from local auto stores and they got nothing on this Meguiar's product. This stuff does not leave any smears but only if you use it under the sun it does and its very easy to wipe clean. This stuff removed deep water stains with ease that my car had, just use it under shade and cool car and you'll get a show room quality car. 
They only fit around a standard thickness roll bar not the newer jeep arrangement with the plastic cover shroud of the late models. Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. I tried to be careful, so I enter my car information. Amazon fit checks show that it would fit 1996 Lexus LS400. I ordered and found out it didn't fit. My car has an arm that requires the thin side but this wiper blade is too big to fit. 
Don't buy this rear wiper for a 1st generation xB, it will NOT fit! Get OEM or a wiper from elsewhere! Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. 
These are thick and well-made, and provide smooth application of wax on your car.  On the down side--because they are so thick, they absorb a lot of wax that just ends up being washed out of the pad after use.  Also, I did soak the pad overnight because it was a little dirty after using it all over my car.  It still hasn't cleaned out all of the dirt and excess wax.  I'll see how it looks after washing it in my washing machine. This is a great quick dusting tool if you are like me and try to take care of the paint on your car.I do a quick dusting with this before covering up the car at night. I use a CalCar Cover (Noah) to reduce sun damage and do a quick wipe to remove dust from the day before pulling the cover over. This will help reduce scratches in the clear coat and paint. These dusters are good when pollen is in the air too, but I would recommend being careful not to try and wipe down too much pollen. The yarn on this duster is soaked in wax so things will stick to them. Although they say to shake out the brush after wiping down the car, I wouldn't want to overload the duster and risk scratches down the road. These dusters last a long time, and are effective even when they've got a few years of dirt/dust on them, so maybe I'm being a little over cautious. However, I've been using my original duster for 13 years and just got a second, new one, this past month. The new dusters are a little lower in quality, seeming to have less yarn and are a little lighter, but they appear to be just as effective as the older ones. They come with a plastic sleeve to store it in, which is very handy to keep the duster from getting messed up when not in use.Be aware the duster needs to be &#34;seasoned&#34; after purchasing. This means that the first few times you use it you may get some streaks from the wax on your paint. The wax comes off easily with a microfiber cloth. This wax streaking will stop after the first few uses.Also you should NEVER use it on a hot surface (like a car left in the sun or on a hot hood/engine cover after driving). Wipe the dust off in the shade or in the evening and after the engine has had time to cool off.Finally, don't use this to replace washing your vehicle. If you have a clean car to start with then this will help keep it clean/dust free longer. It's only designed to take off a light layer of dust on the paint and glass surfaces. This dust will usually collect on the flat horizontal areas, so that and the top edges are the places you'll most frequently use it. Use care and try to avoid wiping behind the wheels where road dirt kicks up. You don't want this duster getting tar and other oily grime on it. I can't say how good it is with beach/sand dust since that's a lot sharper/more damaging and heavier. Maybe other reviewers have commented on that elsewhere.I'd also recommend the mini duster (search Amazon for California mini duster). It's a great complement to the full size one, but perfectly sized for a quick wipe of the dashboard, door sills and other smaller, less dusty areas. You have to wash the leather chamois before using or there will be residue left on your car. After it is broke in it worked great for drying with a microfiber cloth. 
Easy to use. Keeps my trailer hitch safe and secure.Has a cover over the key hole to protect from rain and dirt. I needed a cover for my bike that I park outside, this cover is made to cover your bike inside to keep the dust off. very thin don't think it would make it a full year outside so I got a heavy duty one. I use this one for a dust cover on my tool box. These should come factory standard.  They look awesome installed, they give you some traction when stepping on the doors lower frame, and they keep you from uglying up the paint.  Couldnt be easier to put on, just rag off any mud/dust/ect from the area, use the supplied alcohol wipes to take off any oils and such from touching the area and line the piece up, pull the strip off the double stick, and press down along its length, easy peasy. 
Fits perfectly for my 2003 Toyota Camry, but the number of folds in the filter were fewer than the OEM one. It's short 10 folds compared to the Toyota OEM cabin air filter. Fit perfectly on my 2012 Honda Civic Si. Way better than spending the premium for Honda to do it, takes like 1 minute. Looks and fits the same for a 2000 Toyota Sienna van. I ordered extra so I will not be without any at a later date.

I bought this one (Super Jumbo) for my Toyota Camry, hoping it would fit. Well, it did not fit. I had to return it, and order the regular Jumbo sunshade. The regular Jumbo sunshade fits the windshield like a glove. Quality is good, and it folds up to about 14&#34;. So, if you have a 2007-2013 Toyota Camry, DO NOT BUY THIS ONE!!! Order the regular Jumbo size.Amazon, can you please look into getting some sort of reference guide that will show customers the correct vehicle application? This would make buying this product a whole lot easier.CPS 
Sizes listed in reviews and the two in the description (15.8 x 10.5 x 5, and 12.5 x 9.5 x 7) don't match to what I received...The bag I received is in between what has been listed in the descriptions:  13.5" x 9" x 6" (empty).While seemingly a good quality bag, with a fair amount of straps and attached rain-cover (hidden in the heel of the bag), it seems the manufacturer (or seller) has no idea how to use a measuring tape!The bag itself is quite nice... good padding, rubberized bottom to prevent sliding, small pockets on either side, and zippers seem of reasonable quality.For the price and bag quality, I'm not complaining.  It works great on my CB750, and it does fit on the pillion of my VT1100c2 (without having to remove my rider backrest)  So if you have standard seating (or a touring/adventure style), this bag will do well for you as a pillion bag, and with a little strap adjustments, it also fits vertical on the front or back of a sissy-bar, or horizontal on a larger luggage rack... I bought two sets / 4 total. I use them near the middle of the lifting range which puts the saddle about 18 to 19 inches high. This is perfect to get my truck off the ground and give me an inch or so of ground clearance to R&R; the tires and do other work underneath the vehicle.I don't need 6t worth of lift, but I like how these j/s have a wide lifting range. With these set for my range (as stated above), they are not teetering at the top of the range like others I've used in the past, but are comfortably in the middle. They are very stable and solid units.It would be helpful if the info stated the lifting range of the units, not just the tonnage they can support as a pair.Min. Lift Height (in.)14 29/32Max. Lift Height (in.)23 1/2 Like others I have found the cover to fall short in the sizing department. I understand it's leather and unlike a comparable vinyl based product, sizing is critical because unlike vinyl, leather can't be stretched too much for a fit. This limits you to a steering wheel that is within 5mm of the product's diameter. I have tried fitting this on two steering wheels. First on my F250 and it was literally impossible. The diameter of the cover missed it by inches. Then I tried fitting this on my Saturn Vue. Now this is important, because the Vue is geared towards women whom have small hands, ergo the steering wheel is smaller and skinnier. So you would think the Vue is a perfect candidate...NOPE. I wrestled with the installation and would described it like sparring with a bear. After 10mins (not including breaks) I finally got the thing on the Vue. The result was the leather had stretched so much, it literally developed permanent stretch marks. Also, like other's who have commented in their Feedback, the wrap only made it barely halfway around the grip of the wheel. So there are now two pressure points on my hands from the front and back seams of the wrap when gripping the wheel.I gave it a rating of three due to it's exceptional quality. It is well made in the sense that its leather is very thick and the seams are well stitched. If this was right-size for my application it would have rated it Five.Part of the poor fit was my fault since I didn't pay close enough attention to the specs and prior to ordering I should have measured my steering wheels for proper fit. I mistakenly assumed since I had two steering wheels and one that is especially skinny, that It wouldn't have been a problem fitting.Take proper care with the dimensions of 15 x 1.5  Measure the girth of your steering wheel with a seamstress measuring tape. If 1.5" does not cover at least 70% of you steering wheel circumference and the wheel's diameter is great than 15 inches, you will be immensely disappointed or at the very least frustrated with the install. 
We have an SUV. I would normally setup the side view mirrors so that when viewing the rear view mirrors and side view mirrors, there is just a bit of overlap when looking at them. This presents a problem when backing up as you cannot see the curbs clearly. So this helps a lot. The side mirrors are now just looking straight back helping in parallel parking as well backing up to a curb. These mirrors help in making sure that when you are driving and changing lanes, you can see if there is any object in your blindspot without glancing over your shoulders. Great mirrors and to this day, they remain clear. I will get another one - the smaller version of these mirrors - for my sedan. I drive a car that has dead spots on both sides.  This fits the bill as it provides a larger area of view.  You need to look more carefully as all these types of mirrors make the car in view seem a lot further away so use as a reference.  Since these mirrors are fairly small they only use up about 20% of the existing rear view mirrors viewing area.  I only use these on my rear view mirrors as that is when the blind viewing areas occur.  I usually purchase a few different types of these mirrors so I can determine which works best for me and my wife.  Also try on different spots of the existing mirror, before removing the adhesive covering, to determine the best location.  If you attach it in the wrong location these mirrors can be removed by using a one sides razor blade.  Just push down on the razor slowly to prevent the existing mirror from cracking.  Once off you can always purchase new double sided tape to reuse the convex mirror. Put these on a 2006 Yukon Denali XL to see around a 26' travel trailer. They fit like a glove and look very nice. Both the mount and the mirror are solid. You can adjust the little mirror, but it is stiff enough that it doesn't vibrate going down the road. The instructions recommend cleaning your mirror before you put these on and I would recommend it too. The didn't scratch my mirrors and they were hard to slide on and off, but they are tight enough that if you have a large chunk of something on your mirror, it may cause damage to your mirror over time. 
I had a concern with sizing when I bought this.  I purchased the large and it fits my F800GS with a Tourtech top case very well.  Because of the top case, It doesn't cover the tires below the hubs like the photo shows but everything else is securely covered.  The cover is easy to put on and there is no loose sagging fabric.  Nice product for the price Fits a little tight especially around the front fender and floorboards but it works.  I have a 03' Shadow ACE 750cc.  After a couple rain storms I can report my bike stayed dry (except a portion of the front wheel) and through heavy winds, the motorcycle cover stayed put.  What&#8217;s nice about this cover is the price and how it has elastic hooks to secure the cover in place.  If you decide to buy a cover and your bike has a windshield, floor boards and aftermarket mirrors I recommend you buy a 2XL (if your bike is similar in size to a Shadow 750cc).  Look at the picture I posted, mine has stock mirrors and no windshield and fits VERY tight.  My mirrors shift out of place when the cover is on.  Before each ride I have to adjust them cause the cover is soo tight.  Also, if you have floor boards that&#8217;ll make the fit even more tighter.  Buying one size bigger and I would say you bike will be 100% covered. I bought two sets of Braxton seat covers: A tan set, and this grey set.  They both fit well and look good.Installation was easier than I expected.  Not surprisingly, they were much easier to slide over the leather seats.  It wasn't hard getting them on my cloth seats, just a bit more difficult.  On the up side, they don't slip around as much on the cloth seats.The seat covers have a little flap that you have to wedge through the gap where the seat bottom meets the seat back.  That flap has holes in it.  The bottom of the seat cover, near the back, has an elastic band on each side, with a plastic hook on the end.  (Two extra hooks are also included with each cover, affixed in a little bag to the inside of the seat cover bottom.)  After sliding the seat cover into place and getting the flap through that gap, you attach the hooks to the holes in the flap.The hardest part of installation wasn't the fault of the seat covers, but because of how my Sonata's seats are designed.  The cloth on the seat back extends past the gap where the seat back meets the seat bottom.  There are a couple hidden straps that hook the cloth to the underside of the seat.  Once I figured out how to unhook that, I was able to access the flaps of the seat covers, and finish installation.I got two slightly different "versions" of the Braxton seat covers.  My grey set is, according to the date on the box, a few years older than the tan set.  The flap on the older seat covers is a simple flap with two holes in it.  The tan set I have has flaps with four holes in them, and the end of the flaps also have a spongy, cylindrical insert in them.  This insert is presumably intended to help keep the seat cover in place.  The additional holes must be to accommodate different seat designs.  I found both changes (the extra holes and the spongy insert) completely needless, but maybe on some vehicles they would be helpful.  The spongy insert did (of course) make it harder to get the flap through the gap in the seat.In short, these seat covers fit smoothly in both my cars.  They look quite good and they don't slide around enough to be a problem.  They make leather seats more comfortable year-round, and they help keep sweat and dirt off cloth seats.Be sure to check your owner's manual before installing seat covers. Some vehicles have air bags built into the seats, and any kind of covering could impede air bag function. (In fact, the aforementioned Sonata has air bags built into the seats, and I had to stop using these covers in that car.)Recommended! 
The leather sofa, love seat, chair and ottoman were faded and looking rough. One bottle of Lexol restored them to new condition. I cleaned some worn and stained areas with a good saddle soap with a day to dry. Then in one day I was able to go over the furniture with one coat. Use a dish sponge with the blue scrubber top. Use the sponge part, not the scrubber. The scrubber worked well with saddle soap to clean.Let dry for a day. Repeat. Expect the leather to darken. The white stains are curing salts that have worked their way out of the leather. They melt with the Lexol and return into the leather.The result is a buttery soft leather that looks great. A relatively thick, viscous liquid that cleans leather like crazy.  You only need just a bit on a wet rag, then it's off to the races cleaning your leather.  I use this on a leather couch, auto upholstery, shoes, boots and a leather jacket.It only cleans, but it does that well.  For protection you'll need something like Lexol Leather Conditioner (furniture, auto, jacket) or Nikwax (shoes and boots).A little goes a LONG way, doesn't take much to get the cleaning done.  One bottle has lasted me several years. This is a fantastic cleaner for all kinds of dirt. I used it on the painted sheetrock wall where the kids run their hands along it while going down the stairs. You know the kind of dirt that is? It got all that off and did not ruin the finish of the paint. Another example is the grease stain on our synthetic porch floorboards came right off and did not damage that material either. 
I used to purchase these from Honda directly but they charge around $20. For $12, I can find no difference between this product and the OEM. I was a touch skeptical. But I can afford to throw it out if I don't like it.  Well I can say, I will NOT be throwing this out!  I was so impressed with how my cars looked when I was done that I had to ask my self. Why didn't I buy this sooner. And it is true. A little goes a long way. What can I say that has not already Been said.  I love this product and will use it till it is gone then buy some more. 
I wish the tool was about an inch longer. For a 1995 VW Jetta, with the tie rod inserted, I can't clip the wrench part in place because the tool is about a quarter inch too short. It's still usable but the wrench part won't clip in place so there's a lot more fumbling around. I have two cars, both of which require the large #14 sheet metal self-tapping screws to mount the plate to the nylon retainers behind the plate (the ones mounted on the car that the screws screw into). Problem is that diameter of the plastic ring that holds the screw covers is too small to take the screw's large diameter head. The maximum screw head diameter that will fit the ring is .435 inch (11 millimeters). Option 1: Replace the nylon retainers on the car, but different cars have different retainers so one must search for new ones that will accept a #12 screw. Option 2: Try to find #14 self-tapping screws with smaller heads. I shopped around for #14 screws with smaller heads to no avail. Option 3: Grind down the screw head's diameter. Option 4 (not good): On one car I used #12 sheet metal screws that have a smaller diameter, but DO fit the rings, and wrapped the threads with tape. This sort of works, but I really can't tighten them down satisfactorily. So I have to check their security now and then. I'm leaving the other car as is for now. Maybe someone has more practical ideas? Sure would like to hear of them. BTW, SEE THE UPDATE BELOW.UPDATE 11/16/13:I think I've found a viable solution to the above problem. I used a #12 sheet metal self-tapping screw, placed a 1/2-inch long piece of ordinary shrink tubing (1/4" i.d.) over the threads towards the pointed end of the screw. Used a heat gun (or you can use a match, BIC lighter or soldering iron) to shrink the tubing which effectively increases the thread diameter to about that of a #14 screw. This allows me to tighten the screw securely and will last much longer than ordinary tape. One more thing: The THICKNESS of the screw head doesn't quite allow the chrome cap to fully snap into place over the nylon ring. The top of the head needs to be filed down a little leaving enough Philips "X" to use the screwdriver. Fits a little tight especially around the front fender and floorboards but it works.  I have a 03' Shadow ACE 750cc.  After a couple rain storms I can report my bike stayed dry (except a portion of the front wheel) and through heavy winds, the motorcycle cover stayed put.

I use this product on the car's leather seats. The seats are a tan color and really show dirt and stains. This product cleans them up nice. I bought this based on the reviews. Though it seems to condition the leather, it didn't really seem to buff up the finish and restore my leather to its' original, or near new condition. After cleaning all the floors in my home, and all of my car's leather interior, I followed the directions on the package for conditioning and protecting the leather seats in my car.  While it does make the leather more supple and soft, it doesn't buff up to a shine, or even satin finish, Instead, it seems to leave a dull, chalky finish. I own a lot of leather items from car seats to leather couches.  This product is great for both Batick type leather (laquered corrected grain) and semi aniline drum dyed leather.  The cleaner easily removes color transfer caused by blue jeans on your quality leather product.  Just be careful to rub only gently and take your time.  The conditioner is good, but I prefer &#34;Leather CPR&#34; to keep my leather items soft and pliable - also available at Amazon. 
This does not only protect, but cleans stains, road film etc. off the paint and bring its to nice clean shine. My cars have ranged from light colours (white and silver) to darker colours (red and blue) and this works perfectly to clean and protect. Sometimes, depending on how dirty the paint was,  2 applications would be done to restore the finish. Safe on clear coats and glass this is perfect. Also, one heavy shower does not remove the wax. Give it a try. First off, don't get turned off by the name, Yellow is the color of the stuff, it won't turn your paint yellow!  It does look great on yellow paint though, also reds and darker colors like dark blue and black.  For lighter colors you are better off going with something else, Collinite 845 is a great choice.Pros:-DRIPPY wet looks.  You'll want to grab a towel and dry your paint, its that wet!-Decent durability, approx 2-3 months on a car parked outdoors-Fills in minor swirling-Leaves paint nice and slickCons:-Stains trim (rubber, black plastic)-Needs to be applied very thin, otherwise it can be hard to take off-Can streak if used on a hot surface or if too much is usedOverall, this is a great wax that has been around for a very long time because it looks so great.  its a total steal at the price. Used this to clean the vinyl in the interior of a 2011 Corvette that was supposed to be charcoal but had developed a chalky white nasty residue since delivered new from Bowling Green. This cleaner, sprayed on to a microfiber towel, removed all of it very easily and the best part is that it left no residue on the vinyl. It is alcohol based so don't spray it all over the place inside the car, spray on towel then clean. I then applied a coat of Meguiars Protectant Natural Shine with a sponge and wiped excess and the color is now a low luster (no gloss) charcoal that is beautiful as it was intended. 
As with all lexol products...excellant quality and works extremely well for general interior (namely dash) protection.  Serves my needs extremely well.  I highly recommend all of lexol products. This is a leather spray that does help keep the leather soft and looking nice. It is NOT a heavy duty cleaner thus if your leather is in really poor condition like one of my chair covers, this spray will not do the job. This works well on my auto seats and does give a good shine and soft feeling. I like the product. It is easily applied. Do not apply if the leather is really hot after sitting in the driveway as it gets sticky. I should have known better. These item does fit perfect on my 2004 BMW x3. does what its suppose to do. so far so good thanks 
I repaired damaged exterior redwood house siding with Bondo in many places where bushes and trees had rubbed against the siding for decades, leaving deep, sweeping surface mars, some over 2' long and 1/2&#34; deep. Worked perfectly. Also great for patching holes in anything( yes, that includes cars). One car guy I know took 300 lbs of lead out of an older car repair and replaced the lead with Bondo saving that 300 lbs, the weight of two people(or one beer-gut from Wisconsin)! An instant gas mileage improvement.Bondo is nearly a wonder material if used correctly, and that is to use as little filler as possible. In metal, bring the repair surface as close as possible to original, then use Bondo to smooth. Use like putty in small wood and soft material repairs, but for larger and deeper repairs, drill small 1/4&#34; deep anchor holes at differing angles in the bottom/sides of the hole for the Bondo to &#34;grab&#34; onto.  It will then never come loose or fall out.  All craft work is deserving of our best efforts. Give it the respect it deserves by doing your best, and by using the best tools and materials. These scrapers always break at the smallest part of the handle right behind the head. I heated up a length of 3/4 PVC conduit and slid it over the entire handle,allowing it to spread out slightly at the scraper head. Works like a charm, and now it's long enough to reach the center of my truck windshield! Fits a little tight especially around the front fender and floorboards but it works.  I have a 03' Shadow ACE 750cc.  After a couple rain storms I can report my bike stayed dry (except a portion of the front wheel) and through heavy winds, the motorcycle cover stayed put.  What&#8217;s nice about this cover is the price and how it has elastic hooks to secure the cover in place.  If you decide to buy a cover and your bike has a windshield, floor boards and aftermarket mirrors I recommend you buy a 2XL (if your bike is similar in size to a Shadow 750cc).  Look at the picture I posted, mine has stock mirrors and no windshield and fits VERY tight.  My mirrors shift out of place when the cover is on.  Before each ride I have to adjust them cause the cover is soo tight.  Also, if you have floor boards that&#8217;ll make the fit even more tighter.  Buying one size bigger and I would say you bike will be 100% covered. 
Great cover! I put it on in minutes after delivery and warming a little, and it is not moving; low 80's outside today but likely over 110F in the car. I do not have sweaty hands and it does not look like color came off. It is smooth leather and is dyed black, much like belts and shoes, which can rub off on contact (belts do after repeated hand-contact and probably stain the inside of belt loops without our knowing). For those with sweaty hands get a rubber-cover with grips (stinky) or vinyl (slippery) but neither are very durable in hot cars; you won't be as happy with the comfort unless it is leather. Non-leather will smell toxic or be slippery, but it will not bleed color. If your hands sweat they may slip on vinyl or smooth rubber. This product has a great grip and feel and leathery smell.There is an inner rubber-sleeve )non-smelly) that prevents the cover from moving. I set the product in the sun for about 5 minutes and it made it ply-able enough to work it on. I recommend starting with the center-most seam on top of a straight wheel(there are 3 seams at roughly 12,4,8 O'clock), carefully work the outer edge over the wheel and down both sides evenly (the first 3/4's is easy), use patience and care, then roll the edge into position. If it is off-center it cannot be slid sideways. Take it off carefully and begin again with it more centered and work each side evenly; a little here, a little there. Do not put this on cold or stretch without warming; it can damage/crack/tear cold leather.I placed this on a 15" 2008 Chevy Aveo5 steering wheel (do measure your wheel diameter before ordering). The only con to these types of covers is they cannot wrap the inside, so the fingers feel the outer edges of the cover; in this case it is smooth, rolled, and well stitched and I have gotten used to it. It is probably made in China at this price but it looks and feels like good quality. I recommend this and would choose to buy again and recommend to a friend. I also recommend a little leather conditioner on this, much like one would use on leather car interiors. It is smooth leather, not suade or roughened.In 'the old days' I bought wrapped 'stinky' vinyl, and used vinyl to thread through holes and wrap around the cover with tension (still available) and it filled the inner part of the wheel. It was difficult and time-consuming, and, the vinyl strings eventually breaks. I recommend this 'new and improved' version. Rubber and vinyl degrades in heat and UV. Did you know that wonderful 'new car smell' is highly carcinogenic, expecially when hot, and all the glue they use on carpeting and interior fabric, also. This has been well known and accepted for over 50 years but it sells cars. FYI. I have used this same model cover on my bike for nearly a decade, and this is my fourth cover purchase.  They are fantastic quality and fit for the price!Storage indoors, and the cover will easily last 5+ years if you're careful not to snag it, as it will tear easily on sharp corners (mirrors, license-plates, etc.).  For the first 5-6 years of my bike's life, it was stored indoors, and one cover lasted easily during that period... where I live now, I don't have that luxury (yet).Outdoors, this cover will keep your bike dry and protect it from harmful UV damage for at least two seasons (mine started to fall apart after 3-years of year-round, outdoor coverage, but I also coat it annually with Camp-Dry to increase water repellent ability and UV protection).  The elastic does start to give out after a couple of years, but still holds the cover securely on the bike in high winds.Sizing:For sizing, The XL fits perfectly (slightly snug around the license plate and rear turn-signals) over my 1100cc Honda Sabre with 19" windshield, large saddle-bags, and small tour-pack behind sissy-bar.  This XL fits exactly the same as the XL made 10 years ago, with the only exception being the snugness around the license plate and rear turn signals... I'd be happier with an extra inch or two of material back there.If I had to buy again, it would be a toss-up as to the XL or XXL.  My last one was an XXL and it was very loose-fitting, which caused it to flap in the wind, catch wind under it, and sagged in heavy rain, which created places where water would "pocket" on top or droop to the seat-level, eventually soaking through the material.  The XXL also covered (almost) all the way to the ground, which meant more chances of getting it dirty at the bottom or having hot pipes/engine touching the black material (not the heat-resistant silver).Design Change:The newest version of this cover also does not have silver running 360-degrees around the cover, as in the picture.  The black material of the top now covers down to the front wheel, and the silver starts right behind the forks.  This does help you to find the front of the cover in poor lighting, and actually looks much better when on the bike.Cons:My only real issue is that the material of the newest version of this cover is slightly thinner and more "nylon-feel" than "cloth-feel" of the ones made 10 years ago (or even five years ago), and the cover does not have the full Nelson-Rigg logo... missing "More than just a Bike" wording below the logo... no biggie, but having the full logo does make it easier to find the "front" of the cover in the dark :)  I do not believe the thinner feeling material affects the cover in the least, as mine has successfully kept my bike clean and dry during heavy snowfalls and torrential downpours over the past three months, and still looks like NEW.  We'll have to see about longevity... but if it lasts 2-3 years in outdoor conditions, I'll not be complaining!Update 6-8-14:When putting the cover on my bike today in anticipation of rain, the cover ripped as tension was placed over the windshield and mirrors.  The rip was not bad, but very disappointing to spend $40 on a cover that has barely held up to 6-months of use and very mild weather!  I will be contacting Nelson Rigg to obtain a replacement under warranty! I was suprised how well and how easy they worked even on an extended van.  It saves wear and tear on the shoulders. 
This is a leather spray that does help keep the leather soft and looking nice. It is NOT a heavy duty cleaner thus if your leather is in really poor condition like one of my chair covers, this spray will not do the job. This works well on my auto seats and does give a good shine and soft feeling. I like the product. It is easily applied. Do not apply if the leather is really hot after sitting in the driveway as it gets sticky. I should have known better. Armor-All is a miracle worker for tired, dried, old upholstery. It cleans, seals, protects, covers scratches, and makes leather and vinyl look new again. I've been using it since the early 1980s, and highly recommend it.  I use it on the seats, dash, inner doors, and even on the tire sidewalls.  I've also used it on leather and vinyl purses, an office chair, and leather book covers.Just spray, let it soak in, then wipe it off well.  If you buff it, it doesn't leave an oily residue or any odor.  Don't use it on any place that would be a slipping hazard, like floors, because it does leave a slippery finish.Try Armor-All and you'll be amazed at how great your car seats can look! I don't know why Wranglers don't come with some kind of door sill protection, but these are inexpensive and easy enough to apply.Look great, appear to be durable, and have no odd edges to snag. 
This made my 2011 Corvette vinyl interior (door cards, dash, console, etc.) look great. I didn't want a gooey shiney coating that slimes the inside of the windshield and this product is perfect. I cleaned the vinyl first with Interior Detailer and then applied this with a yellow Meguiars sponge and buffed excess with a microfiber towel. The vinyl looks better than when it came from Bowling Green and there is a beautiful low luster non-slimey finish. I bought this steering wheel cover to hide the peeling leather on my 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited steering wheel. I measured the inside dimensions of the wheel, 15". I did not have to heat or stretch the new wheel cover, it fit perfectly and looks great. It's also much easier to keep clean with interior protectant. I own a lot of leather items from car seats to leather couches.  This product is great for both Batick type leather (laquered corrected grain) and semi aniline drum dyed leather.  The cleaner easily removes color transfer caused by blue jeans on your quality leather product.  Just be careful to rub only gently and take your time.  The conditioner is good, but I prefer &#34;Leather CPR&#34; to keep my leather items soft and pliable - also available at Amazon. 
At less then $10 this is a steal!  The unit is well made and really does a nice job.  It's far bettter then the round adapter that plugs straight in and that on the back side you plug in the 30 amp cord.  The 90 degree 15 amp plug emliminates the problem of the cord pulling out or partially disconnecting from the outlet. This is the kind of spark plug gapper / gap tool you should use when gapping Iridium spark plugs. Simply wonderful. Works great for lubricating spark plug and coil boots to allow them to easily slide on and off without damaging the spark plug wire. Just use a little bit in the end of the boot. It will not impeded the flow of current to the spark plug or coil. I have been using this for years on every type of ignition system including lawn mowers and race engines. 
This product appears to include the cable. IT DOESN'T. It's just the mount which it does okay, but you'll have to buy the cable separately. Very quick and easy mounting and really adds to the look of the rear of the Jeep.  These are metal and not a cheap plastic and mount with included screws into the existing lens cover screw holes. The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around! 
Works great, nice to have a second cable, but the OBD end of the cable is angled.  In my case, this cable won't work on my Subaru Outback.  I would prefer the option of a straight OBD connector.  Note that the angle connector works on my other four cars (Mazda, Honda, Dodge). I purchased this belt for my 2003 Chevy Tahoe. I had no idea Chevy would put 2 serpentines on a newer generation vehicle. This smaller belt fits the A/C system only. It works like a champ and fits perfectly. I would recommend the Gatorback belts to EVERYONE! As an installation side note, you have to remove the air intake and larger serpentine to get to this "bottom of the motor" mounted unit.... way to engineer that one GM! I purchased this to be able to attach a high-end hydraulic assisted bike rake on the back of my Jeeps (JKs) with the rear tire still on.  It fit perfectly and teamed with the Bolt Lock BLT7018448 5/8'' Receiver Lock (Keyed specifically for your line of vehicle) it can be kept in the Jeep and my daughter doesn't need anything but her car key.The extender is exactly as advertised, well made, fit perfectly and does eactly what it is inteded for. 
fits my car perfectly, works perfectly, was easy to install. The best measure of a wiper blade is that it does what it is supposed to do, when it is supposed to do it. This product does not fit your 2012 Toyota Tacoma! That's according to Amazon.YES, IT DOES FIT MY 2012 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab.I don't know what that white powder is on the rubber seal, but I cleaned it before installing the cap.  No error codes and no gas stolen so far. They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. 
I have some fog lights that I use on the back of my truck to light up the sides of my 5th wheel when I am pulling in to a camping spot at night. I got these so I can easly connect and disconnect these lights. They make it very easy to connect/disconnect anything you have that just needs power and ground. I spent several weeks trying to decide if i wanted to invest in a brake controller for our new-to-us travel trailer. Since i grew up on a farm, trailers are nothing new to me but brake controllers are. I am pulling a 26' bumper-to-bumper trailer with a 2006 Yukon Denali XL and the 400 miles that I have pulled it have been without issue. However, there was one time that I wished that I had more stopping power and the trailer seemed like a load for the Yukon's brakes,so I started researching brake controllers. First I looked at a middle of the road option from Wal-Mart, but then I ran across this one for $40 more. Somewhere in the reviews a person mentions the cost of not having one, and he/she could not be more right. $20,000.00 SUV, $4,000.00 trailer (weekend warriors), and my priceless family and family pets....and I had to think for two weeks about spending $100.00???I ordered the brake controller and the proper wiring harness from Amazon and had it in two days thanks to my prime membership. With the $10 wiring harness for the Yukon, I was able to install the controller in 20 minutes...no joke. No splicing...no fuse manipulation..no electrical tape...just plug-n-play. Also to my surprise the Yukon had two pre-drilled holes in metal directly under the steering column that fit the brake controller mounting bracket perfectly. Now for a test run.I hooked the trailer up and the controller immediately detected it so I took off slowly down my driveway. While I did look at the brakes when I purchased the trailer (I am pretty sure the previous owner never used them), I had no way of testing the overall system so my first test was to see if the trailer brake system actually worked. It did. In fact, the boost was set on 2 and the wheels locked up with little effort. I tried no boost and then settled on boost 1. I can see where the options of no boost, boost 1, and boost 2 will be nice when going through the mountains.Anyhow, the final test, I took off down the road and not 3 miles from house some yahoo decided to pass me on a two lane road at the crest of a hill and forced me into a situation where I had to put the brakes to the floor. In that instant the trailer brakes locked and stopped the Yukon, not the other way around, and every ounce of buyers remorse was gone just as quickly.Give yourself some piece of mind while saving the brakes on your towing rig. Buy it and grab a wiring harness while you are at it. Almost too bright, but I love it.  Maybe the 100 watt model would be better than these 130's if your eyes are sensitive to bright lights.  Exactly what my 2004 Dodge Ram needed because the factory headlights stink.  My brights were no brighter than my low beam, and my old 1985 Nissan had brighter brights, but these KC 130 watt driving lights solved that problem perfectly.  For not being the full, long range lights KC offers, they sure shine pretty far, plus spread the light out to the sides and up into the trees, a good long range / flood combination.  I mounted them to my push/brush guard.  Took about 3 hours to install because I like to route, hide, and secure the wires very well.  I connected the white switch / relay hot wire to my high beam (brights)wire on the drivers side, so they go on and off with my high / low switch, plus I have the master switch mounted (without the switch frame) near the dash to keep the KC lights off completely if I want.  Just make sure you dim your lights (turn off the KC's) before you see anyone ahead of you or you'll blind them and can get a ticket if on a public road.  First night I tried them a big 8 point ran across the road in front of me, then stopped and pretty much "tip toed" off the road as if he was totally blind and afraid to move.  So beware of animals freezing in front of you with these things.  I turned them off and honked so he could run away.  And no, I don't hunt that way.The wiring diagram on the outside of the box did not show the white power / relay wire, as if it was pre-wired into the main power wire, but luckily there was the white power / relay wire available to tap into my high beam wire.  The wiring diagram on the directions in the box was correct.  Some vehicles newer than 1999 may not allow tapping into the high beam wire because of the vehicle's computer that senses voltage changes, but it worked on mine.  Only thing I had to supply was a sheet metal screw to secure the relay.  I cut off about 5 feet of extra wire that went to the switch.  The length of wire to the lights was just right. 
Works great for lubricating spark plug and coil boots to allow them to easily slide on and off without damaging the spark plug wire. Just use a little bit in the end of the boot. It will not impeded the flow of current to the spark plug or coil. I have been using this for years on every type of ignition system including lawn mowers and race engines. The Wolo Model BA-97 Heavy Duty Commercial Grade Back-Up Alarm is perfect for the rear of any RV of size.  It&#8217;s small ( about 3 wide x 3&#8221; tall and 2&#8221; deep) and loud enough to alert anyone you are backing.  The sound is exactly like what you hear on garbage trucks and many commercial vehicles.Wiring the unit is simple and one of the mounting bolt/screw holes automatically grounds the horn to the vehicle chassis. I used the backup light wiring in the truck to trailer cable that was not used by my trailer to get the 12 Volt positive voltage to the trailer.  I then connected to the trailer wiring block using a14 gauge &#8220;hot&#8221; lead to take the voltage to the backup alarm mounted on the read of the trailer.  Whenever I have the trailer attached to the truck and then shift the truck into reverse Bingo.  The alarm begins beeping.  Of course anytime the truck backup lights are activated, like using the key fob to shut off the truck burglar alarm, the backup horn activates for about 30 seconds. Easy to install, setup, wire up and use.  Its nice to have one connection point and be able to plug pin what ever kind of trailer you might want to tow. It works great with my camper, snow mobile trailer, ATV trailer and my old beater gravel, dirt and construction material trailer.Installation:  If you have a 4 wire harness already installed (like I did) you can just plug into that for all the lights, blinkers and brake lights, then simply add a break controller for trailer breaking  and connect to the wiring on the multi tow adapter. It also has pass through power connections for your attached trailer- which is great for charging your camper batteries while driving down the road.  We used this feature all summer while dry camping (camping with out plug in power) all over the midwest United States. 
These things are awesome.  I bought two along with some relays and relay sockets so I could get them enough power directly from the battery to do serious audible damage.  Make sure to buy this one with its mate, the 72102 high tone.  After wiring in the relays, these went in my 2000 Civic perfectly.  They replaced the crappy horn in there, and I used the wiring to tie into the relay signal hot wire.  Then, I grounded the relay to the body by tying it into the ground wire from one of the horns.  The horns come with these little wire slide connectors that you can clamp onto your wires.  I used wire nuts to tie all the wires together - I suggest you do the same.  I was able to mount them facing away from eachother with grounding connectors in between the mounts using a single bolt that held the old Honda horn.  This was ideal, and very clean - no drilling required!I suggest finding yourself a 12V DC 4-pin or 5-pin 40 Amp SPST ISO Micro Relay for this project.  Also, it really helps to have a 5-Pin Wire Harness Relay Socket.  This will give you all the wires you need directly from the relay.  These are really cheap items, and you shouldn't have trouble finding them.  The 4-pin relays work fine with the 5-pin sockets.  Then, educate yourself on how relays work, and wire that bad boy up!  I got my relay and relay socket on ebay.Overall, I'm very pleased with this product.  Buy it now if you want to be heard on the highway. These things are awesome.

I bought this dual horn kit from another outlet, but figured I'd add my review here. This was purchased for a 2012 Wrangler Unlimited. The stock horn is fairly weak and usually doesn't produce a reaction from anyone who has cut me off or drives 15 mph while chatting on their phones.The install was rather tight. I didn't remove the front grill and just worked from the top down, right above the driver-side headlight. I mounted one right to the bracket where the stock horn was, and the other was mounted in a nearby hole where a hood alarm sensor would be located. Since I don't have a remote start kit, the sensor was absent.I highly recommend that you have some type of magnetic tool to pick up dropped bolts. Unless you remove the grill, you will be dropping things. Also, the kit comes with nothing more than the two horns and 2 ground wires. I had to purchase the mounting bolts/nuts and decided that, rather than splice into the factory wiring, to make a couple of harnesses (see image). I used male blade connectors on one end of (2) 10", 18 gauge wires, then used splice connectors to attach another 6" wire to each of these leads. On all of the (4) remaining wire ends, I placed female blade connectors. It turned the wiring job into a simple plug-n-play operation, while utilizing the factory hot and ground.The horns are definitely louder and the dual horn tone cuts through like a champ. It does startle people all around me when I lay on it. That was the idea, so I'm really happy with it. Supposedly, they upgraded 2013 models to a dual horn. Some report that it's still weaker than this PIAA upgrade. I recommend this horn kit if you want to restore your horn's functionality. 
Easy to replace. It lacks Toyota instructions, but it is exactly like existing Toyota part with all wires colored the same way so it is very obvious how to connect those.The original part has a silicone rubber tube going all the way from top to bottom with wires running inside it. This part only provides a short length of tubing that, at best, would cover half of the length of wires on my car.I thing they should provide a &#34;telescoping&#34; tubing of two diameters with one going inside of the other while you are crimping wires and then extended to cover the full length of wires The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around! The relay setup is a breeze, if you want to make things easy just connect the aux plug directly to the power plug & horn will work at all times, rather than just when the car is on. You CANNOT take the bolt off on the back, dont try to, the covers can be removed and painted with ease by removing the black screws around the bezel. Also, we cut & drilled a new hole on the bracket to place them where we wanted them & that bracket is made of reinforced Steele & took forever to drill through. Excellent product

We used this feature all summer while dry camping (camping with out plug in power) all over the midwest United States. We often tow our a-frame travel trailer which is near the tow rating of our Grand Vitara. A hot day with a strong headwind proved to be too much for the factory cooling system &#60;a pipe through the radiator&#62; and the transmission fluid got too hot and bubbled over.I had been debating getting a cooler thinking &#34;Why would I need one if it is rated  for this work from the factory&#34;. If you don't have an external cooler and will be towing near your maximum, just do it and forget about it!  For the do-it-yourself installer, the hardest part is mounting it. Great way to keep your tongue jack from resting on wet ground or concrete, likely extending the life by not letting it rust out so quick.  Using with a tow package that includes a weight distribution assembly can prove problematic for smaller SUV's/cars though (tested with a 2008 Ford Escape with Class 3 hitch), as the tongue jack stand is so tall that you have to sometimes jack up your car up to clear it!  Still, I can't fault the jack stand for that.  Highly recommended. 
Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.  The pickle fork is the last resort for me, as it will damage the balljoint boot.I prefer to use the Snap On balljoint remover.  If that one cannot fit, then I will try this tool.  If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork. They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. IT WORKS 
bought this for my 2004 honda crv.  fit perfectly and cleared the code.  easy to do just give the threads some wd40 Inexpensive, yet works as good as the ones sold by Honda dealerships. Made true to specs and fits right into the slot on my Accord 2006.Will buy again. Fit perfectly on my 2012 Honda Civic Si. Way better than spending the premium for Honda to do it, takes like 1 minute. 
It fits perfectly to my 2005 Honda Accord.Filter quality seems to be good. bought this for my 2004 honda crv.  fit perfectly and cleared the code.  easy to do just give the threads some wd40 fits my car perfectly, works perfectly, was easy to install. The best measure of a wiper blade is that it does what it is supposed to do, when it is supposed to do it. 
Accutire MS-5550 is perfect to fit in the trunk of a car/van for those times when an air compressor is needed.  It has the standard adaptors for sports balls, air mattress inflatables etc, and the standard locking valve stem connector.  This works well on bikes and the inflatables.  Car tires take more time to inflate or get up to pressure.  Power for this little compressor comes from the 12 volt outlet in the car/van.  There is good length on the power cord and depending where the 12 volt outlet is on your vehicle it will reach to the car's tires.  Light weight and easy to use make this ideal for carrying around.  The problem with this is that on flat surfaces the compressor doesn't stand still when started.  It will walk around. Gauges are small and hard to read and there didn't seem to be a light for night time reading.  This is basically something to add to the traveling safety kit or to have on hand for those emergency bike tire inflating times.  Made of plastic that feels cheap.  I'm betting this would not take much of a drop to break.  With so many better compressors out on the market today, I can only moderately recommend this one.  It will work but there are better ones, Black & Decker comes to mind, and not for that much more money. If you are adjusting headlights on a Ford with 4mm adjusting screws this tool is a must. The review that states that the screw moves out enough to keep you from removing the tool from the end of the screw is questionable however. On all the  headlights I have seen, the adjustment on the light moves in and out and the screw dose not, so If you can get the tool on, you will always be able to get it off. Tool is well made and the infinite ratchet is handy. Should last a lifetime even though the vehicle will not. All mechanics I know have one and Amazon is the cheapest. I ordered one that said it was used, in good condition, for ten bucks. When it arrived, it was on the original blister pack, unopened. This is not always the case, but this time, it was. If you are thinking of buying one of these tools, do it. I had a need for dielectric grease and this fit my needs.....I use it on my motorcycles ,cars, boat and trucks. on ignition /wiring connections. keeps dirt  and moisture out and makes for great electrical connections.  pricey ,but I have to have it. 
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Purchased this as an OE replacement per the factory manual for a Honda powered snow thrower and it works just fine! Bought this to install with an aftermarket Kenwood Navigation 7120 on my 08 Toyota Tacoma.  It took several hours to install, but it works great with the wheel controls in my Toyota. 
How can one really rate it, as it is used for protection and no idae how long it should last, yet is was as listed so I give it the benifit ogf the doubt... I was suprised how well and how easy they worked even on an extended van.  It saves wear and tear on the shoulders. Not only do they not fit, very thin and wonder how long they will last.  Also if you have batteries with the post and screw/nut the latter is not covered. 
Almost too bright, but I love it.  Maybe the 100 watt model would be better than these 130's if your eyes are sensitive to bright lights.  Exactly what my 2004 Dodge Ram needed because the factory headlights stink.  My brights were no brighter than my low beam, and my old 1985 Nissan had brighter brights, but these KC 130 watt driving lights solved that problem perfectly.  For not being the full, long range lights KC offers, they sure shine pretty far, plus spread the light out to the sides and up into the trees, a good long range / flood combination.  I mounted them to my push/brush guard.  Took about 3 hours to install because I like to route, hide, and secure the wires very well.  I connected the white switch / relay hot wire to my high beam (brights)wire on the drivers side, so they go on and off with my high / low switch, plus I have the master switch mounted (without the switch frame) near the dash to keep the KC lights off completely if I want.  Just make sure you dim your lights (turn off the KC's) before you see anyone ahead of you or you'll blind them and can get a ticket if on a public road.  First night I tried them a big 8 point ran across the road in front of me, then stopped and pretty much "tip toed" off the road as if he was totally blind and afraid to move.  So beware of animals freezing in front of you with these things.  I turned them off and honked so he could run away.  And no, I don't hunt that way.The wiring diagram on the outside of the box did not show the white power / relay wire, as if it was pre-wired into the main power wire, but luckily there was the white power / relay wire available to tap into my high beam wire.  The wiring diagram on the directions in the box was correct.  Some vehicles newer than 1999 may not allow tapping into the high beam wire because of the vehicle's computer that senses voltage changes, but it worked on mine.  Only thing I had to supply was a sheet metal screw to secure the relay.  I cut off about 5 feet of extra wire that went to the switch.  The length of wire to the lights was just right. I have some fog lights that I use on the back of my truck to light up the sides of my 5th wheel when I am pulling in to a camping spot at night. I got these so I can easly connect and disconnect these lights. They make it very easy to connect/disconnect anything you have that just needs power and ground. I installed these on my 2005 GMC Envoy XL with brush guard and they work and look great. They really light up the offroad trails and remote roads at night. I used to have the very large Hella offroad lights and these are just as bright.Installation is no more or less difficult than other lights. There's no magic here - you have to run 12V and ground to the lights, the relay, to the battery, etc. 
Fantastic price for a very handy tool in the garage!  When working on automotive and motorcycle accessories one needs to &#34;power them up&#34; to test them or their function and this power source provides the juice required.  You can also use auto accessories having the standard cord and cigarette lighter plug, e.g. CB radio, car vac, inflator, etc.  I use mine for testing lighting and accessories I install. Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars I use K&N; oil filters on all my vehicles.  This one fits my 2000 Honda S2000.  As I don't drive it much, I change the oil and filter annually, not on mileage.  Full synthetic oil and a quality K&N; filter are cheap insurance for a 9000 RPM motor.  Glad Amazon stocks them at a competitive price.  For the Honda, easiest access is underneath, and easiest removal tool is this:GearWrench 9032 1-Inch Combination Ratcheting Wrench. 
The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around! Installed this with a Curt hitch on a 2002 crv. It plugs into the ready made connection by the driver side quarter panel. I store the extra cord beneath the table in the storage area and just run the cord out through the rear door when towing. The weatherstripping protects the wiring from damage. Very easy and no splicing and wiring to mess with. Hope this review helps. I purchased this to be able to attach a high-end hydraulic assisted bike rake on the back of my Jeeps (JKs) with the rear tire still on.  It fit perfectly and teamed with the Bolt Lock BLT7018448 5/8'' Receiver Lock (Keyed specifically for your line of vehicle) it can be kept in the Jeep and my daughter doesn't need anything but her car key.The extender is exactly as advertised, well made, fit perfectly and does eactly what it is inteded for. 
This is a leather spray that does help keep the leather soft and looking nice. It is NOT a heavy duty cleaner thus if your leather is in really poor condition like one of my chair covers, this spray will not do the job. This works well on my auto seats and does give a good shine and soft feeling. I like the product. It is easily applied. Do not apply if the leather is really hot after sitting in the driveway as it gets sticky. I should have known better. This steering wheel cover is exactly what I was looking for.  Soft leather, and is very durable, and the stitching is very high quality.  I love the way this makes my interior look and the feeling is great. I like this stuff, it's easy to work and doesn't get lumpy, sands nice and quick.  Just prep properly and apply in thin coats, sand almost all of it off and do again til you get it right. 
These are a good accessory to have because the clips are decent quality and the varied colors are helpful in keeping track of all the wires. please note these are not white - but beige... other than that they are standard rv baggage catches These are typical hard plastic handles, contoured for grip. The stock bar is substantial at 7/16". Edges are finished nicely. The metal shaft is unpolished and has a finish to prevent slippage.I don't care if all my hand tools are the same color, if it matters to you then note these may come in a different color than illustrate (see my pics).Made in the U.S.A. - nice.j 
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. I put these in my '03 TJ Jeep Wrangler.  They fit perfect and work exactly as you'd expect they should.  I installed a set of 55w HIDs in them and the light output is tremendous. 
The GM bumper connector has its own cap to keep the weather out, and so does this Adapter. But I really wouldn't leave this adapter plugged in all the time because the GM connector then is not sealed.This adapter fits well, with a locating keyway that fits the groove of the GM connector, aligning all the pins correctly. It's a tight fit so that it won't fall out in case the cable to your trailer has enough weight to tug on this adapter to any significant degree.I don't have any illumination problems so the LED functions are not fully tested.  Frankly, I do a walk-around after hooking up anyway, with marker lights and flashers on to check that everything works.  I presume the LEDs will tell me if there's an issue some day. Bought them with the cruiser plates and while they did fit the plates they did not fit the wholes on the car. Dont know why. Work fine on the front but not the rear. Also they are security screws, so do not lose the device that comes with them. FYI I purchased this to be able to attach a high-end hydraulic assisted bike rake on the back of my Jeeps (JKs) with the rear tire still on.  It fit perfectly and teamed with the Bolt Lock BLT7018448 5/8'' Receiver Lock (Keyed specifically for your line of vehicle) it can be kept in the Jeep and my daughter doesn't need anything but her car key.The extender is exactly as advertised, well made, fit perfectly and does eactly what it is inteded for. 
You have to have this. Mounts most typically on the outside of the RV.. Just tilt the outside door/vent open and Olsen the peacock valve. No tools required!  Very cool! Installed this with a Curt hitch on a 2002 crv. It plugs into the ready made connection by the driver side quarter panel. I store the extra cord beneath the table in the storage area and just run the cord out through the rear door when towing. The weatherstripping protects the wiring from damage. Very easy and no splicing and wiring to mess with. Hope this review helps. Pretty straightforward, I use it on all my under-hood electrical connections where dirt/water/debris could pose a problem. Spark plug boots, battery terminals, ground straps, etc. 
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. Exactly what was offered, fit nicely, no major prep work, won't fade or crack, adjusts perfectly, easy removal and fits under seat in truck Great Fit

The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around! There is no need to lower muffler, just let it cool then install the hitch. You may also want to purchase the bracket for the trailer wiring flat 4 connector . (Hopkins 48595 flat 4 bracket) Our 2012 Sonic only came with the anemic, cheapo small car sounding one note horn.  I initially bought the low note, thinking it was what the car needed, but that is the note/tone that came on the vehicle stock from GM.  The high note gives it the two tone sound, similar to what is on our larger Yukon SUV.  It does get noticed much more than a single note horn.Note: For those installing this on a Chevy Sonic, Cruze or Aveo, I was able to unbolt the driver's side front fender liner, starting on the forward side, and removed 4 screws up to the top of the wheel well.  Next i had to hold this fender liner back temporarily with a small block of wood and some string in one of the holes tied to the rim.  With an assistant honking the horn, I easily found the stock horn, spliced into the positive horn wire and used an existing small mounting hole, behind and below the existing horn mount location.  The supplied screw and ground wire worked perfectly.  If you use the 'piggyback' style wire splice that taps into an existing wire, be sure to put some clear silicon caulk over the splice ends after crimping, and then wrap some electrical tape around the snap cover to keep the connection dry and tightly secured. 
These were for our rv and they work great. I have used them several times and once you get used to using them you will like it. I own three packs, one for each of my cars. They work as advertised and have never failed me. Clore makes quality booster packs. I have used all 3 numerous times and have also used the packs to power tire inflators. I own one that has the built in inflator. It also works as well as the 660. I am happy they have added the battery charge indicator light. Its easier to know when you have gotten to the full charge and you cannot overcharge the newer style units. The unit simply cannot be overcharged. The ones without the charge light make you rely on the specs for proper charge time. The gauge is good but you cannot be 100% sure you are at full charge unless its a newer style unit. I have been using these towels to remove wax for years on my cars.  They are wonderful.They are extremely soft and can be flipped many times during the removal process.  If there is any stray drops of water from washing the car these mop it right up.  They also fare well in the washing machine and come out looking like new.Buying these in 3 packs is a great deal and they will last you a long time. 
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Exact fit for Lexus RX300. As easy to install as I could've expected with all parts: the sensor, the cable and  the plug matching the original layout. 
Perfect for exhaust work.  I bought it for a catalytic converter and o2 sensor project because it is rated for: -30F to 1800F I welded a piece of flat stock on the insert for the motorhome. This adapter is for my Dodge Grand Caravan. Works great, nice to have a second cable, but the OBD end of the cable is angled.  In my case, this cable won't work on my Subaru Outback.  I would prefer the option of a straight OBD connector.  Note that the angle connector works on my other four cars (Mazda, Honda, Dodge). 
This product appears to include the cable. IT DOESN'T. It's just the mount which it does okay, but you'll have to buy the cable separately. Very quick and easy mounting and really adds to the look of the rear of the Jeep.  These are metal and not a cheap plastic and mount with included screws into the existing lens cover screw holes.

They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. This makes it SO easy to charge in conjunction with my battery tender.  So far it has fit all my vehicles batteries ( Acura integra, Toyota Tundra, Toyota Pickup ) Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted.

PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars Inexpensive, yet works as good as the ones sold by Honda dealerships. Made true to specs and fits right into the slot on my Accord 2006.Will buy again. Works great, nice to have a second cable, but the OBD end of the cable is angled.  In my case, this cable won't work on my Subaru Outback.  I would prefer the option of a straight OBD connector.  Note that the angle connector works on my other four cars (Mazda, Honda, Dodge). 
I welded a piece of flat stock on the insert for the motorhome. This adapter is for my Dodge Grand Caravan. Though Amazon stated this cap would not fit my 2013 Ford E-450 chassis (for a Jayco, Class C, Greyhawk, RV), I ordered it anyway as it fits many other years of Ford trucks and looks the same. It is rare for the same vehcle to change a design like that. It, in fact, fits perfectly. Our RV gas filler has no cover (not that that is a deterrant) and 60 gallons is a target for remote theft of gas, or a target for vandalism. This cap fits well. I have not been able to fit the stock cap-retainer onto it yet. I understand these modern vehicles have anti siphon plugs but one can still end up with foreign substances in the exposed fill-tube. This is a good 'ounce of prevention'.Highly recommended. I purchased this belt for my 2003 Chevy Tahoe. I had no idea Chevy would put 2 serpentines on a newer generation vehicle. This smaller belt fits the A/C system only. It works like a champ and fits perfectly. I would recommend the Gatorback belts to EVERYONE! As an installation side note, you have to remove the air intake and larger serpentine to get to this "bottom of the motor" mounted unit.... way to engineer that one GM! 
I beleave I can really feel the difference in the power in the car can't tell the difference in mileage yet . The engine is quieter and smother running . Yes I would recommend this oil to all my friends.Paul Installed these thinking it would aid in poor lighting on a motor home, but I honestly can't tell much of a difference I could tell the difference it made in my limited slip differential . It was quieter and seemed smother . to soon to tell if it made a difference in mileage . Yes I would recommend it to a friend .Paul 
They fit perfectly onto the vehicle and or trailer wire when not in use. With the retaining loop they stay with the connectors when you are connected vehicle to trailer. Front side (towards the engine) oxygen sensor fit "exactly." That means there is not a bit of "extra" wire from the sensor to the connector. They do make one with a longer cord, but not sure why, because you can't get your hand/arm in there any better with a longer cord anyway!I did the front sensors on both sides of the car, because someone recommend it to keep things running smoothly on both sides. Glad I did, it seems to be working.Got a wrench? I ordered a fancy pants "socket" from Amazon along with the sensors to get into the "tight" spot. It turned out that the fancy sockets do NOT fit on the front sensors, at least not on this car, and then I ran around town trying to find one of those fancy pants "special" wrenches with the "split" socket on the end, but nobody had them.In desperation, and hoping for the best, I purchased a standard 7/8" combination wrench (where the heck is mine anyway?) to get the sensor off. Oops, I put the wrench on the old sensor and it wasn't even tight (probably why it gave me the DTC)! Installation was easy, aside from the arm and hand contortions getting the plugs loose (try a long shaft screwdriver from below to pop the clip while you're holding the other end from above).Note, on my car, "bank 1" is the cylinder set on the passenger side of the car! Nice product. To install you remove the headrest and then slip the ends of the strap through the head rest poles. Simply re-insert the headrest and you are all set. I have a 2012 JKU and passengers who ride in the back love it. Helps them (especially the shorter ones) get in the Jeep. 
Picked one of these up to replace my old cap. The old cap had two problems - first, the gasket was long-gone, and second, it had only two "hooks" on the bayonet connection instead of four.The Camco has good gaskets, a solid fit, and four "hooks" to create a snug fit on the bayonet connection. All in all, far superior to what I had before. my old one broke and this one was a pefect fit replacement. Just unscrewed the old one and used the new screws supplied. Worked fine in the Wife's 2002 Bravada.  Factory 7-Blade GM Towing Connector.  Took longer to hook the trailer to the ball than to plug in my trailer lights. 
I have used Mobil 1 on all my vehicle's for years and after buying a new to me, HD 2010 ultra Limited was pleased to see the they also made the V-twin moil 1 for it. I call them to ask what makes this a better product than the OEM oil that HD sell's and they explained that it is specially formulated to meet or exceed the requirement need with air cooled HD engineers as well as trans and primary case requirements. I believe that they manufacture a superior product and will be only running it on my bike. You can't say much about this quick disconnect plug. But one for sure: having it installedcharging your motorcycle is much easier than using those old fashioned alligator clamps.If you also interested in buying a battery maintainer the harness is included in this one:&#34;Black & Decker BM3B 6V and 12V Battery Charger / Maintainer&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051D3MP6/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0You may also like to hear that there is a adapter available from SAE-2-USB plug available:&#34;SAE to USB Adapter - Motorcycle Cell Phone Charger&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007VFFQRE/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1So if you also use a navigation system while riding you can easily charge this on the road. I was using this to power my Viair 00073 70P Heavy Duty Portable Compressor but with 6amp it doenst do the Job, returned it and went with Schumacher 1216 12V 15 Amp Power Converter, good to go! 
This doesn't fit my 2007 Toyota Tacoma factory hitch.  It needs to be 2 7/8".  The package on this lock reads 2 5/8 but I measured it at 2 3/4.  I'm going to have to grind the bolt.Update, Jan 2014.  An noted I had to grind the inside ends to make this fit in my Tacoma OEM hitch.  Once, it was ground to the proper length, I spray-painted the bolt and have used it to haul a 19-foot trailer and attach my tow hook ever since with no further problems. The reason I am giving the lock three stars is the lock would not work for our trailer hitch. we have a Lance trailer and the hitch was to wide for the lock to fit over. I may grind down the sides of our hitch so I may use it, I will check with Lance first so not to weeken the hitch if for and reason it may then the reese lock is unuseable for my lance trailer and I will pass the lock on to someone who can use it. I like that this can be installed on multiple hitch balls, so if a new vehicle requires a higher or lower hitch height I can just move this to the new hitch.

Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. Fits on my Hi-Lift jack just fine. Does exactly what it is supposed to do.If you are using it on wheels that are deep make sure the straps are long enough to reach the spoke pattern. I wish there was a guide somewhere that shows you what cars these sunshades fit. I bought this one (Super Jumbo) for my Toyota Camry, hoping it would fit. Well, it did not fit. I had to return it, and order the regular Jumbo sunshade. The regular Jumbo sunshade fits the windshield like a glove. Quality is good, and it folds up to about 14&#34;. So, if you have a 2007-2013 Toyota Camry, DO NOT BUY THIS ONE!!! Order the regular Jumbo size.Amazon, can you please look into getting some sort of reference guide that will show customers the correct vehicle application? This would make buying this product a whole lot easier.CPS 
When I saw at the picture online I thought they were reflective, like a mirror finish, but they were just light gray, with a darker fabric on some of the sides. They fit the window fairly well, with only a small area in the bottom middle of the window where light gets in. It does help a little with keeping the car and steering wheel from getting too hot while sitting in the sun. Its better than using nothing. I've owned Jeep Wranglers for seven years now. I switched from a traditional cleaner-wax product because Jeep Wranglers have black plastic hard-tops (well, during the winter at least!), black plastic fender flares, black plastic mirror housings, and on the newer Wranglers, black plastic bumpers and door handles and assorted other trim. A traditional wax applied to any of those turns them white, but if you don't treat them with something, they fade to an ugly mottled gray over time. Thus the Turtle Wax Ice, which can be applied to everything -- hard top, fender flares, bumpers, and the Jeep itself. This allows me to make my whole Jeep shine without worrying about getting some white residue on things that aren't supposed to have white residue.Note that this cannot be used on glass, it just streaks. So to make your glass  and mirrors nice and shiny and keep them from fogging up easily in the winter, you'll still need a traditional wax, not a polymer-based product (note - do not apply to exterior front or back glass, just to interior glass and to the side windows!). The same is true for plastic windows on Jeep soft tops, a traditional wax will keep them from turning yellow and help keep them scratch-free, a polymer product like this will just make them streaky. And if you're looking at a deteriorated finish or one with baked in bugs and tar, use some other product first to recondition your finish, don't use this on a badly oxidized or bug-and-tar-spattered paint job. So this product (and other similar polymer products) is not a solution for all protective purposes, but it sure does work well where it does work. This product is pricy, but not as much as others that don't fit the bill as well.  Cruiser Accessories 76100 Tuf-Shield Clear Flat License Plate Cover is just that and a good product to use to simply and effectively cover your vehicle's plate with a protective clear plastic cover, while so many other immediately darken from exposure to the sun's rays, this one seems to stay clear. 
just what i needed but got at a discount. ordered 5 of them to save time and to keep a stock of them. i have 2 cars that both use this filter so im sure they will be used up quickly and ill be ordering again!2007 grand prix 38002004 grand prix 3800SC I bought these horns to replace my rusted out horns on my camaro.  Note that you need the high and low as they work in unison.  It took me about 15 min to replace them and these work as good as new. You'll have to splice in to your existing wiring ( I just used some 3m quick connects to splice in ) and I reused the stock locations and bolts.  These horns come with brackets as well. These work great just as described. The bulb I had in the right headlight recently blew out in the middle of the night which resulted in getting pulled over ten minutes later. I probably would not buy these again, instead I am going to get a pair of HID lights. 
I was in need of an Air Compressor but I did not want to get one that was huge.  This little guy is pretty small and does the job!  You set your PSI, plug it in and hook up to whatever needs air.  The Air Compressor will stop automatically once it reaches the preset PSI.  It is awesom if it ever breaks down I will be picking up another! Fits my 2002 Silverado LS 5.3L vortec RWD, extended cab. Very simple install, DON'T remove the third bolt closest to the driver side of the under dash shield, you can move it out of the way without taking it all the way off, saving you a headache trying to line the cover back up again. Doesn't have a &#34;fresh breeze&#34; smell and I can still smell the dirty air of city driving, but still a HUGE upgrade from what I had in there. Basically a pile of dirt and leaves with some filter in the middle. Air flow is superb. This little compressor has far exceeded my expectations. I have had two plumbed to an air tank that ran air tools on my rig. They run forever and have never gave me a problem. The only thing I would suggest is to switch out the male hose adaptor. This will allow you to run a regular sized higher quality hose that can attach to regular air tools/hoses in a pinch. The one that comes with it is an odd ball size. Don't get me wrong...you can't run air tools directly from this compressor. But using two into a tank makes it possible. I would buy another one in a heart beat. A little noisy but what compressor isn't?! It pushed a decent amount of air for the money. You need one for your vehicle so just buy it. 
The springs are a god send and do a great job of closing the screen door behind you. They were easy to install and will buy them in the future with our next trailer. Picked these up for the solar panels I installed in my trailer and truck. They are nice quality and will work just fine. After years of being an idiot and trying to gently use my fingers to prevent my door from scraping on the wall of my car port, I bought this. Works exactly like it should... by being a barrier between my door and the wall. The thickness is perfect. It could stand to be a little longer for my inaccurate parking jobs... but very good nonetheless. Even has two holes cut out so you can drill the sucker into a wall if need be.Note: The vinyl tape that it says is frequently purchased with this product will not work on a textured (stucco) wall. 
GLAD  I  WENT  WITH  THE  CHROME AND  NOT  THE BLACK ONE, I  HOOKED  THIS ONE UP TO  MY GV1400 MOTORCYCLE IF  YOU  HAVE JUST  A  LITTLE  KNOW  HOW YOU CAN  DO  IT YOUR SELF , ALL  YOU WILL NEED TO GO WITH THIS IS A RELAY THAT DOES NOT COME WITH IT. YOU  CAN  GET IT ON HERE OR ANY PART STORE, I  HAVE MADE MANY PEOPLE JUMP  DUE  TO THE SOUND OF  THE  HORNS  LOUDNESS. When it comes to safe transportation, I try to take every preventive measures no matter how unlikely I will ever need it. First aid kits, flashlights, safety triangle, fire extinguisher, light reflecting outfit and finally this one, these make make up my doomsday inventory so far. Among them this may look to be the most extreme item but believe me people do get trapped in the car and unfortunately lose their lives just because they can not free themselves in time.I am afraid I don't have hands on experience about how this device works and I would never want such an experience, but just by writing the name resqme on youtube you will instantly see over 20 videos about that device. There you will see that it can really cut through the seat belt with one blow and somehow pulverize the window glass within seconds... So when you need it, if you can keep calm, it may take less than 30 second to get yourself out of the vehicle which would otherwise take minutes or not be possible at all.Due to great reviews and demonstrative videos, I purchased this item. I paid around $10 for a single one but sometimes there are bundles on amazon and you can buy a dual pack for $15.Although it is designed as key chain which is how you can keep it accessible on an operating car (provided that you don't have one of those new keyless devices) but like many other reviewers, I did not put it on my keychain. Although it is as small as it can be, still takes up some space in your keychain and feels bulky. Besides, since it has a built in blade, it may be misunderstood as a knife and put you some headache in airports and places like that. So, to me the best place to carry it is in the glovebox in a tiny case. But make sure that at no circumstance, it moves from where you put it and that you can access it easily from where you are trapped. This solution may not be ideal for some people and/or cars but then I advise you to look for a place that you can use for the purpose.I wholeheartedly recommend this product for anyone who values their life and wants to raise the safety level of their car trips and wish that you will never ever need to use it... I bought this to look in my winch on my Jeep. I just took one of the bolts out and put this in, I would thing if they really want it I'm sure they can get it out, this just makes it a little harder and if you install two they will have to work twice as hard. And for the price you can buy two..

First perfectly on Toyota GenII Prius which includes model years 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009. The replacement is super easy, taking less than 2 minutes if you know what you are doing. If you have never done it before, save yourself $80 at the dealership and take 5-10 minutes to do it.1) Open the lower glovebox2) Squeeze in on the sides of the glovebox near the top where there are 2 plastic cylinders that keep the glovebox from falling to the ground and lower the glovebox past where the stoppers stop it from going3) Remove the little piston on the right side of the glovebox that slows its decent by moving the ring part to the right and off of its little plastic nub house.4) The glovebox should now completely detach, and you can rest it somewhere where it won't get scratched.5) The white box directly behind the glovebox contains the HVAC blower motor that gives you air circulation in the car as well as the filter. There are two tabs on the left and right sides of the smaller rectangle on top. Squeeze the tabs and pull towards you. This small book sized thing will come out completely. Take this to a garbage pail or outside and remove the cloth filter from inside.6) Replace filter with this one. Make sure to put the flat side on the bottom like the original and position the little tabs over the fabric to hold it loosly in place.7) Replace the white small book with new filter into the slot you removed it from above the blower motor assembly. Note that the white plastic piece you removed has the words &#34;Up&#34; or &#34;Top Side&#34; molded into the plastic. Make sure to install it so that these words are right side up (readable).8) Replace glove box reverse of disassembly9) Enjoy the $80 to $120 you saved versus going to the stealership and know that it was done correctly. This product fits like it should and would look really nice if it had been shipped properly!  I got it and the box was all crunched.  The item had no cushioning around it and the front is bent in.  Need to return for a replacement!  It would have been 5 stars if the front had not been bent in and it was packed properly!  Fits right over my 3 burner RV stove and rest on the counter top.  I will be adding rubber feet so that it will scratch the sides of my stove nor my counter top!  To secure it you have to screw it to the counter top.  The back has a hing with 5 screw holes in it where you can secure it or it will stay put without screwing it down.  It came with 5 long screws.  Not sure if i want to secure mine yet.  I have a new RV and not sure i want to put screw holes in the knife holder behind the stove! Truly an impressive assembly of 4 parts. If there is a finer example of a little piece of rubbery roll-y wheel attached to a wooden handle with some metal parts in the middle tying it all together, show me. 
This steering wheel cover is exactly what I was looking for.  Soft leather, and is very durable, and the stitching is very high quality.  I love the way this makes my interior look and the feeling is great. This made my 2011 Corvette vinyl interior (door cards, dash, console, etc.) look great. I didn't want a gooey shiney coating that slimes the inside of the windshield and this product is perfect. I cleaned the vinyl first with Interior Detailer and then applied this with a yellow Meguiars sponge and buffed excess with a microfiber towel. The vinyl looks better than when it came from Bowling Green and there is a beautiful low luster non-slimey finish. The cutting board is really nice!  Solid piece of wood and it has the RV shelf liner attached to it so it holds fast to the RV stove top.It also has the flexible plastic sheet (flexible stowaway cutting mat) included.  Wish I knew that before I bought the flexible plastic cutting mat but now I just have two. 
I wish there was a guide somewhere that shows you what cars these sunshades fit. I bought this one (Super Jumbo) for my Toyota Camry, hoping it would fit. Well, it did not fit. I had to return it, and order the regular Jumbo sunshade. The regular Jumbo sunshade fits the windshield like a glove. Quality is good, and it folds up to about 14&#34;. So, if you have a 2007-2013 Toyota Camry, DO NOT BUY THIS ONE!!! Order the regular Jumbo size.Amazon, can you please look into getting some sort of reference guide that will show customers the correct vehicle application? This would make buying this product a whole lot easier.CPS Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars 
These Jeep Wrangler 2 Door-Door Entry Guards are nice looking, easy to install (just clean the area) and remove the double sided tape and stick it down. It's that easy and they are useful. these are a great additional tool for leveling the front and sides of the camper when you are by ourself! They are large enough to see from a distance to keep things on the level Received within 3 days. Saw Mythbusters do a test of these LifeHammers and they worked quite well cutting through the seatbealt and any of the windows EXCEPT the WINDSHIELD. Commit that to memory! In a emergency situation it will not easily crack or break the windshield, side and rear glass only. Mine is getting mounted in clear sight and access from the front seat, right in the middle of the rear seat benches so as to be easily grabbed by all! I have had experience with a stuck seat belt and they are a bitch to cut through with a semi-sharp pockt knife. 
It does a great job of hold a good charge and then turns off, and just senses the charge and turns back on  when battery starts loosing charge. would wreck amend this product for anybody that has anything that the battery will stay in over the winter or any kind of storage... Michael I bought this for my Mom.  She has a riding mower that sometimes sits for a long time without use.  I used the connectors that you screw onto the terminals and then you have a little plug that you then connect to the charging unit whenever you need.  No clamping onto the battery, just plug it in.  You can leave this on all the time and it will shut off when the battery is charged coming on only when needed.  Safe and easy.  Great for over-wintering a battery when you want to keep it charged.Update.  I bought one of these for my truck which is not driven very often.  I first made sure the battery was charged since it is a heavy duty truck battery.  Then I did the screw mount connectors and leave the charger on all of the time.  It keeps the battery charged by shutting on and off as needed.  No need to tend it.Can't say enough good about this product for battery maintenance. This is my third battery charger for my cars.  This was for my Toyota 4Runner which is 2-wheel drive and doesn't get used much here in Colorado winters.  Keep the battery up to par, so turned over quickly when needed.... 
Red line diff  oil for my 02 C5 Z06!!!other than all diff oils smelling bad, great oil and will put my Z06 to the limit w/o worring about diff. You can't say much about this quick disconnect plug. But one for sure: having it installedcharging your motorcycle is much easier than using those old fashioned alligator clamps.If you also interested in buying a battery maintainer the harness is included in this one:&#34;Black & Decker BM3B 6V and 12V Battery Charger / Maintainer&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051D3MP6/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0You may also like to hear that there is a adapter available from SAE-2-USB plug available:&#34;SAE to USB Adapter - Motorcycle Cell Phone Charger&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007VFFQRE/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1So if you also use a navigation system while riding you can easily charge this on the road. A nice charger. Is also smaller than it appears on the picture. So easy to carry and handle.Unfortunately I had to send it back because it just has the standard clamps to charge.There were no &#34;Quick Disconnect Extension&#34; option to easy plug-n-charge a motorcycle.So I bought the &#34;Black & Decker BM3B 6V and 12V Battery Charger / Maintainer&#34;:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051D3MP6/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0 
i got this tender for charging two motorcycles that i have.  i was able to fully charge a brand new battery i purchased (its recommended to charge a new motorcycle battery after adding the acid).  i like that this comes with a long enough cord so i can plug it into the outlet without moving my bike or using an extension cable.  it also comes with the clamps and adapter you can use if your battery has this for easy charging.  i used this on a shorai battery for my cbr and worked great.there are no settings to change, just attach the connection to the battery and plug it into the wall outlet and you're good to go.great tender for a good price Sure the switch placement sucks,but I do like the pump overall.I can plug in to a 120 outlet or use the 12 volt car accessory outlet. Installed in a friends van so he can charge his PC and cell phone when he camps.  I had to cut off the clamps and solder wiring with a fuse and on/off switch directly to the battery.  Created a 250 watt draw and the inverter didn't even get warm.  So 400 watts should not be a problem.  I would buy this unit again, 
Around the time I got this product I was in the process of reading more about lead acid batteries than I ever wanted to know. Like with many subjects, this one is rife with mythology and outright BS. If you cut to the chase, in the vast majority of cases, one thing alone is responsible for killing or shortening the lives of lead acid batteries: sulfation.  There are only two things you can do to keep a lead acid battery from sulfating: 1) always keep it on a charger at 13.6V, which is unrealistic except for emergency only equipment, 2) limit your depth of discharge, 3) periodically rejuvinate and desulfate your batteries.  It's in the last bit that this product has proven handy.  If you put your battery on this machine every now and then, say once a week or so for overnight, you can be sure your battery, no matter the type of lead acid battery, will work better and live longer.I would (have) bought this product and its variants more than once after this initial purchase. I haveAlso know that no product can work a miracle.  If you abuse your batteries, you will kill them and it's not that hard to do.  But with the price of your typical car battery going into the $200 to $500 range these days, the price of maintaining one properly seems less and less.  Why toss your money and your battery into the scrap heap when you can use one of these to keep it working better and longer? Bought the Battery Tender Junior to keep my lawn tractor's battery charged over the winter.  I've had it now for about two weeks.  I know it says I can leave it attached overnight and it will decide on its own when to charge and when to remain idle but I unplug it at night and plug it in again in the morning (I'm retired, so I have lots of time for this sort of nonsense).  In any event, it does what it claims it will do.  The battery on the tractor is now always ready to go, so no need to lug out my large automotive charger.Note that the transformer that plugs into an outlet is large, so you need some space around the outlet to let it "hang" when it's plugged in.  Small point but my outlet was in a crowed space so I had to plug it in upside down.  Its weight in that position made it prone to pull away from the outlet.  I solved that by wrapping the charger line over a cup hook to hold the charger brick in a more upright position against the outlet.Summary:  This item works well, does what it says it will do and I'm sorry I didn't get it sooner. If you have vehicles that you only run half the year- a motorcycle, or a snowmobile, or a large outboard- it's important to keep the battery charged during the rest of the year, or it'll self-discharge and eventually self-destruct. The best way to keep that battery fresh is to bring it indoors and connect an intelligent trickle charger that'll keep it topped off without overcharging. I have a constantly changing collection of small motorcycles and scooters in my garage and a marine battery that gets used occasionally to run a trolling motor, and to go with them, a small collection of these battery tenders in both 6 and 12 volt models. They're not terribly expensive, and they work. You can also buy multi-charge models like theBattery Tender 021-0128 Battery Tender Plus 12V Battery Chargerthat will handle from two to as many as ten batteries at once, and if you do have more than one battery to maintain, they'e a better deal, and the higher end models are also regulated and temperature controlled. If I was starting from zero that's the way I'd go, but I started with just one, and they're all still working, so I have no need to upgrade. 
I ordered 2 different chargers to maintain my gate opener's deep cycle battery (a simple 4 output charger with extension cords for charging other deep cycle batteries from amazonBattery Tender 022-0148-DL-WH 12V 4-Bank Battery Management System) and this unit has a far superior charging design.The 4 bank battery tender does a simple fast rate charge then switches to a trickle charge at a constant voltage with 4 outputs.This unit pulses the battery under charge and features 3 operating modes with different current outputs for different sized batteries. The selections are motorcycle which also works well for SLA gel cells or AGM batteries, standard automotive starting battery, deep cycle batttery, and off.What makes the CTEK unit special is that it uses a pulse charge in all modes to attempt to desulphate batteries, while the battery tender does not.  This method of charging has proven successful in restoring lead acid batteries that won't take a charge any more.It comes with a waterproof 12V output cable and a set of clips or rings for permanent installation under the hood of your car.  In addition to the LEDs for indicating the type of battery being charged, a second set is provided for empty, 1/2 full, and maintenance pulse charge mode.There is also a noticable increase in quality between the battery tender and this unit - small details like a water sealed housing and gaskets on the connectors indicate quality in manufacture.For a single 12V lead chemistry battery this is a useful, well made tool. This four station battery tender is just as simple to use as the single units.  One simply plugs the unit in and connects the battery via alligator clips or a connection affixed to the battery. Its a simple task to tell what state the battery is in.  If amber the battery is deep charging, if green range it is 80 to 100% charged.  After the battery is charged, leaving in connected will put the unit in float mode, which will keep the battery "topped off" without damaging it.  My only concern is the housing is plastic and all of my single units are metal.  It does have mounting holes so it can be wall mounted or affixed more securely to a shelf, etc.  Like the single units, total time from opening the box to charging is about 2 minutes.By the way, instructions for deciphering the state of the amber and green lights are not in the instruction manual but on the right side of the unit.I also ordered the 12 foot extension cables, a good call if you need to have your batteries more than about four feet from the unit. PROS:Indicator light while charging. Shows when charging is complete.AC power cable.Easy to get inexpensive terminal adapters so you can leave them on your vehicle and trickle charge as necessary. 
This is a high-quality, well made grease gun. It connects well, and you have to move the connection sideways to pop it off the grease fitting - which is perfect because you do not want on that pops off easily. I pumped a lot of grease through this into hubs and the pressure was high, the pump action was smooth and nothing leasked. When disconnected, it also does not leak (it does not pressure out unless you pump it). Pros:Light weightLength is goodBias cut on the end is a great feature.Cons:Valve does not completely shut off water flow.Takes some serious pressure to turn off valve.This makes filling my RV potable water tank so much easier. Once it is full, I can shut off the water at the filler tube, rather than having to run back to the spigot. It also prevents excessive back flow. Seems a bit flimsy but works well .... I always hated leaving the hose in when it topped off and water spewed out I would need to run to the hose to turn it off while it was geyser of water flying out the side of my trailer .... I just wait till its full ... turn the shut-off valve off and I'm good to go wit no mess. Plus having a large valve at the end help with the hose not folding and crimping. For the price it does what it's suppose to do. 
Perfect for washing the RV...strong pole you can scrub as high as you need to go or can leverage. Holds its position when set.  Very pleased. Mitt holds lots of water and both sides can be used as it is a flat style with cuff. Have used it for several applications besides my MAF, and will be using it on a regular basis as needed. 
Well made Excellent quality.  American made.  Top notch all the way around.  Built to last. Great quality.  American made. 
For the price, this is a reliable and accurate gauge. I keep a digital tire gauge in all my cars, and the readings this unit gives is consistent with the others. I have not encountered any challenges re type of rim in using this gauge. Fits fine. THIS IS THE PERFECT TIRE PRESSURE GAUGE FOR CHECKING TIRE PRESSURE ACCURATELY, QUICKLY AND EASILY.  SIMPLY PUT THE END OVER THE VALVE STEM, HOLD IT FIRMLY FOR A SECOND OR TWO AND READ THE PRESSURE.  THE GAUGE ON THE NEW TIRE PUMP IS NOT CORRECT AND NEITHER IS THE PRESSURE GAUGE ON THE ELECTRIC TIRE PUMP THAT ATTACHES TO THE CIGARETTE LIGHTER. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE ACCUTIRE MS DIGITAL TIRE PRESSURE GAUGE. I have purchased other tire gauges from Accutire and have found them to be sturdy, long lasting and accurate. I purchased this gauge for use on my Honda Goldwing motorcycle. I needed a right angle low clearance gauge to clear the brake disks and check my suspension pressure. I also have found the gauge convenient for my wife's Honda 50, 2013 Honda CRV w/TPM valves and my ATV's. With this gauge I don't have to bend or place angle pressure on the sides of the tire valve stems. 
This meter should be used as a general indication of voltage only. I checked it against a calibrated professional meter and found it to be reading 4 volts high. This put the reading in the read area when in fact the voltage was acceptable. I will still use it on my generator and simply subtract 4 volts from the reading. Used this way it is marginally effective. This is a great gauge to have in glove compartment or garage, checked it against my very accurate pencil gauge that is not a cheap one, same pressure readings. A number of reviewers have commented that the accuracy of this gauge is 0.1 psi.  It isn't.  The accuracy spec is +- 0.5 psi +- 1% of the reading.  This means that the gauge could show anything between 34.1 to 35.9 for a tire actually filled to 35 psi.Long story short...don't believe that 1/10 digit number that's being displayed.  If there's a slight change in tire pressure, it'll show it, but the actual value can vary significantly from what's shown. 
Great quality.  American made. Made in China poor quality item that does not befit the Robert Bosch brand at all.Not for winter for sure.The origin of the product should be stated at the product page.If I knew it were a MADE-IN-CHINA I would not have bought it. Considering this is made in China, it is a quality product, too bad all my locks are keyed to the some number 
You may have a tire pressure gauge, but this tool allows you to measure accurately when your tires need replacing.  It is durable and precise in its ability to measure the depth of your tire treads. THIS IS THE PERFECT TIRE PRESSURE GAUGE FOR CHECKING TIRE PRESSURE ACCURATELY, QUICKLY AND EASILY.  SIMPLY PUT THE END OVER THE VALVE STEM, HOLD IT FIRMLY FOR A SECOND OR TWO AND READ THE PRESSURE.  THE GAUGE ON THE NEW TIRE PUMP IS NOT CORRECT AND NEITHER IS THE PRESSURE GAUGE ON THE ELECTRIC TIRE PUMP THAT ATTACHES TO THE CIGARETTE LIGHTER. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE ACCUTIRE MS DIGITAL TIRE PRESSURE GAUGE. My original tire gauge was nice, but I have two tires on three-piece rims and couldn't get the chuck on the valve stem because there was very little clearance. With this gauge, clearance around the valve stem is not an issue. The fact that the chuck rotates makes it easy to use too. The gauge is easy to read, and the pressure bleed feature makes adjusting tire pressures easy. All in all, a perfect solution for anyone who takes tire pressures seriously. 
with plastic bumpers being the norm, thought I'd use this plastic polish.  It brings the shine to the plastic painted areas just like step 2 does to the metal. The cutting board is really nice!  Solid piece of wood and it has the RV shelf liner attached to it so it holds fast to the RV stove top.It also has the flexible plastic sheet (flexible stowaway cutting mat) included.  Wish I knew that before I bought the flexible plastic cutting mat but now I just have two. I've been using brass scrapers for over 20 years. I have not had any problems with scratching; brass is softer than glass so it makes no sense that it would scratch the glass - must be the glass/snow/ice is dirty in which case any scraper is going to cause scratches. It is not a large scraper which makes sense because if it were any larger you would not be able to get enough leverage to make it work and you'd just bend the brass or break the plastic handle. Once you try it you'll throw your plastic scrapers in the trash. 
Be advised, this bit is 3 and 1/2 inches long. Description says 5.7 inches long which is NOT correct.  Did not work with my air hammer. Its too short does not have enough space to travel when installed on the quick release. So will have to return and get a longer one. I bought this because I was tired of using the stick gauges that are sketchy at best. This has an easy read dial and holds the pressure reading until you release it. You can also use it to deflate your tire to a desired pressure and monitor the droppage. I wanted a 130-amp load tester because--at least per the manufacturers' claims--these units are more accurate than 100-amp models.  The OTC 3181 looks exactly like the Actron CP7614 (except for brand markings on the front), but is far less expensive.The OTC 3182 is a digital 130-amp load tester for just a bit more money than this OTC 3181, and it has a couple more features (an alternator test lead and a ripple detection light), but I tend to have better luck with analog products over digital products, in terms of reliability. Also, when you use the OTC 3182, it shows you just a number (the voltage reading), and you're on your own to interpret it. The OTC 3181, on the other hand, has "replace/weak/good" markings (in red/yellow/green), which make it very easy to interpret the results, without having to remember or think about what voltage range is acceptable during testing.I was a little surprised at the size of the unit when I opened the box.  It's a bit large!  The clamps are large and strong.  The overall feel is quality.When testing a battery (unless it's a totally dead battery), the unit will heat up very significantly.  Through the vent holes in the unit, you can actually see metal coils getting red hot, like little heater elements.  That's how the load is applied--in the form of heat.Testing is easy: With the vehicle and the key both off, attach the negative clamp to the negative post of the battery, then attach the positive clamp to the positive post of the battery.  (People with mechanical experience may think this is backwards, since you normally attach the positive clamp first.  I assure you, I am quoting the manufacturer here on the order advised.)  Press and hold the rocker switch for 10 seconds, and then quickly look at the needle while still holding the switch down.  (They advise against holding the rocker switch for more than 15 seconds.) To test the charging system, begin with the clamps attached as described above, then start the car and run it at 1,200 - 1,500 RPM, and read the needle.  Remove the positive clamp, and then the negative.When I was choosing a load tester, I kept reading about "zero adjust" features.  I didn't know what that meant.  Now that I have a unit in hand, I can see that it refers to a little screw in the face of the unit; turning this screw one way or the other (with the clamps not connected to anything!) allows you to adjust the needle so that it is accurately zeroed.  That's all. 
Well built meter that functions just as it should.  The dials are easy to read and as far as I can tell the meter is accurate. I own both a travel trailer and a sailboat, so needed a method to check battery condition as well as charging ability of my truck's system.  This unit addresses both needs.  I was surprised at how large and heavily constructed it was, but am pleased at its obvious durability. There was some confusion on my part initially on how to read one of the scales, and feel they could do a little better in explaining that. But, it's easy to figure out once connected to a battery.  Simple and straight-forward to use, no college degree or inch-thick operating manual required.  Just hook up and read.  Purchase with confidence. I rated this product 5 stars for quality and ease of use. The scale is easy to read and moves easily and stays where it needs to be after reading the depth. 
The only flaw that kept me from leaving a 5-star rating is the "inaccurate" gauge.. Everything else works great & the inflator unit itself is built with quality material designed to withstand heavy use.After having read other's review here, I caliberated this Milton S-506 gauge against a high end digital gauge that I use on my passenger vehicles & the reading from this gauge is consistantly 4 psi lower.I bought this gauge for my Chevy DuraMax Dually, so I simply inflate the tires up to 64 psi in order to achieve 60 psi pressure on all the tires.So word to the wise, caliberate it against a better, more precise gauge first before you put it to use, this way you'll know how much to "offset" before you rely on it completely.Overall, it is an excellent value. I am only concerned about how accurate it actually is. There is a couple pounds difference between my tire pressure monitoring system on the car and this gauge. This gauge is closer to the TPMS system then the cheap pencil style pressure gauge I was using and was thinking all these years I may have been running my tires on the low side on my vehicles that didn't have that pressure system because of that pencil style gauge. It is easy to use and easy to read. I use this often to check the tire pressure on our cars, optimal tire pressure means better gas mileage and thread wear. This works fast and is accurate. The only option I wish this had was a beep on completion of check. I have used other gauges that beeps to tell me the test is completed which was a nice feature. 
Not much to say, it either works or it doesn't.... this product is not rocket science and does what it claims. It say's that it doesn't fit on my 04 Crown Vic but, it does :) Just to let people know! A number of reviewers have commented that the accuracy of this gauge is 0.1 psi.  It isn't.  The accuracy spec is +- 0.5 psi +- 1% of the reading.  This means that the gauge could show anything between 34.1 to 35.9 for a tire actually filled to 35 psi.Long story short...don't believe that 1/10 digit number that's being displayed.  If there's a slight change in tire pressure, it'll show it, but the actual value can vary significantly from what's shown. 
These things are rated 8,000lbs but that's for ( GVW ) so while it's correct technically in reality each item is rated by the label at 2,000lbs per each item and if you had 4 (they sell them in pairs), if you had 4 of them you could put 8,000lbs on them, technically and according to them.****I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO RELY ON USER REVIEWS TO GET THE INDIVIDUAL WEIGHT RATING!!!!***GVW is a very deceptive and dangerous way to market and label these products.  Consider this, on a truck, the majority of the weight is on the front two wheels while the rear wheels don't have as much weight - same is true on a front wheel vehicle.  This leads to situations where you could overextend the capacity of these products.I'd like a very clear rating: 2,000lbs, 4,000lbs, 6,000lbs for each stand or ramp on Amazon so that I know how much weight I can safely put on it similar to what is found on jacks....a jack is not labeled as 6,000lbs if it can lift a 6,000GVW vehicle, 6,000lbs means that the jack can lift 6,000lbs!After all, I'm planning to get under these things!!!!On items like this where someone's life very literally depends on the labeling ---  it would be really really really nice (and a legal requirement) that the specifications on Amazon very clearly stated both the operating weight, maximium weight, and crush (failure) weight per each ramp/stand versus this GVW rating which is deceptive and just plain dangerous.I have very literally found people working underneath 8,000lbs trucks without the wheels using jack stands sold as "2ton" when in reality each jack stand was only rated at 1ton or 2,000lbs.....their comment back, "this is a 2 ton stand and 8,000lbs GVW divided by 4 is 2,000lbs or 1ton, plenty of margin."  When in reality 6,000lbs are up front....3,000lb for each wheel  and each stand rated at only 2,000lbs....making their jack stand 150% overloaded! --- horrendously scary (all because marketing is so bad in this area).  Yes people should exercise care in using double protection and users should Always read their instructions and warning before putting their life on the line -- but for the love of God, there is a responsibility on the makers and marketers of these products to label them very clearly and in bold with the weight that EACH can hold and Amazon should post that weight for each item in BOLD Yellow or Orange wording with very clear warnings.Amazon and automotive sellers on Amazon need to get on the ball regarding the needs of auto ethusiasts and for the safety of the weekend mechanic who should not have to do complex math to figure out how much weight each item can hold!We REALLY need to get away from GVW, it's deceptive and dangerous!****I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO RELY ON USER REVIEWS TO GET THE INDIVIDUAL WEIGHT RATING!!!!*** A number of reviewers have commented that the accuracy of this gauge is 0.1 psi.  It isn't.  The accuracy spec is +- 0.5 psi +- 1% of the reading.

I  don't know what else to say but there is a word count requirement for the review... 
Dries fast and sands easily. No problem filling cracks in bondo or any other surface. Adheres well to most surfaces. i use a lot of it for small repairs. This is one of my favorite wheel cleaners. It cuts the brake dust and dirt with ease without damaging your wheels. Works well on any finish like including alloy, chrome and even black wheels.  All wheel cleaners are not created equal. This cleaner will clean very gentle so no damage occurs. Your wheels typically have a clearcoat, and this is sprayed on, then using a soft brush, you can get all the brake dust off, then rinse the wheel.  But you can ALSO spray the rest of your car with this.  Brake dust settles on the lower part of your car's front doors, so you can spray these along the bottom.  I use my hand (with a glove) to rub the liquid as I hose it down, and it cleans all of the dust and much of the road tar, meaning very little use of the abrasive clay that most detailers will resort to for tough spots.  This is a less aggressive alternative to clay, and should be in every car-lover's arsenal.Recommended! 
Yes, these are wheel chocks.  They're not fancy, but they will hold a round piece of rubber just fine. I just got one for my 2001 Chevy Suburban and one for my 2006 Ford Five hundred. These covers fit well. They don't slide and they are made of real leather. You can smell the leather scent. One imprtant note is that as a result of these covers being made well and of a thick leather, they do make the driving experience slightly different. They do make the steering wheel thicker. No regrets, the steering wheels on my cars were in poor condition. The alternative would have been to purchace new steering wheels. These are your standard tire tool with a comfortable grip, but I love it when the thing you get that does the job fine, is also made here in the USA.  Seems well-made and durable. 
awesome product, super comfy handles and will hold almost any weight.  I've had 250lb friends support their weight on these, so they will suffice for almost any application. How can one really rate it, as it is used for protection and no idae how long it should last, yet is was as listed so I give it the benifit ogf the doubt... works well and holds fast and steady. I am really surprised by the light weight and sturdy construction. Will buy them again for the other things i have. 
These scrapers always break at the smallest part of the handle right behind the head. I heated up a length of 3/4 PVC conduit and slid it over the entire handle,allowing it to spread out slightly at the scraper head. Works like a charm, and now it's long enough to reach the center of my truck windshield! The install is easy, just level your camper using a carpenter level of 3 feet or longer.  Set the level from side-to-side on your smooth flooring or counter top. Then set the level from front-to-back the same way on the smooth flooring or counter top.  Now position the Hopkins 08525 levels, one on the side you prefer to work from at the front of the camper, on a flat vertical surface.  Do the same on a side wall near the front corner on a smooth vertical surface.  Use the double stick tape to position, but consider adding pop rivets or small screws to hold the setting for many years.  Holes are provided in the Hopkins levels.Use the front level first to drive onto leveling ramps or boards, then use the side level along with the tongue jack to finish (after you unhitch). Extend your stabilizer jacks and you're set for level comfortable sleeping in your camper. This seems to be one of the better levelers. There are two different scales on these levels. One is for the side-to-side (back of the coach) and the other is for the front-to-back (side of the coach). The reason there are different scales are they are more-or-less calibrated in inches.For example, it is simple Trigonometry to determine how many inches the coach is out of level simply by using the formula for right-angles and solve for one side. The input values are the angle (determined by the level) and distance from the level to the point at where you want to know how many inches of lift are needed.For the side-to-side level, the 1&#34; markings are pretty accurate as long as you put the scale in the center of the coach, as most coaches are within an inch or two of width from another.  However, for the front-to-back level, even though you put the scale in the center, the result will vary wildly due to the length of the coach. Using this level on a 18ft coach will result in a far different measurement than say a 35ft coach.Also, if you don't put the level in the center (in the side or back), then the two ends of the coach will be different. For example, if the level is in the center, then when the level measures 1&#34; off level, that means 1&#34; on either front or back. But if you put the level off-center, then the level reading 1&#34; might truly be 1/2&#34; on one end, and 1 1/2&#34; on the other. Again, it is simply a principle of Right Angles in Trigonometry.Also, do not rely on the self-adhesive backing as over time it can move. As hard as it may be for you to do, drilling a couple holes and inserting screws into the levels is the best bet. 
Well made Excellent quality.  American made.  Top notch all the way around.  Built to last. Great quality.  American made. 
It does what it is supposed to do, that is to increase placement distance from the car to the electrical outlet this thing is heavy and is a serious tool.  the air hose has an adapter that screws onto the air valve on the tire which is new to me but it works well.  worth the money if you are in the business of rescuing cars.  the only thing i was disappointed in was the lack of a light showing the charge was complete.  you have to push the red button to show the voltage of the battery in the unit. I am working on my own truck and am not a mechanic.  I have not used the pump on the truck, yet, but just tested the pump for functions and leaks.This pump has 2 functions: vacuum and pressure, which are selected with a knob on the side.  The pressure release valve has a large handle, but this makes it easy to accidentally release the pressure.  The gauge swivels, so the gauge must be fitted with an o ring.  It comes with a nice case and all the little parts has their own places.For both vacuum and pressure, nothing leaked for at least 20 minutes.For about $72.00, Mityvac beats the Lisle vacuum pump (single function and came with broken pressure release valve) handily.Even though it will be extra expense, I plan to look for a bigger container for draining brake fluid.  I bought a rubber cork stopper to see if I can make my own air tight container.

It is easy to use and easy to read. The S and G Tool Aid 23970 In-Line Spark Checker Kit for Recessed Plugs does exactly what it claims. The various components provided in the kit adapt to a variety of mechanical situations and ofter flexibility for use on a wide range of equipment.  I bought it to use with my 4-cycle engine on my Pressure Washer.  The spark is easy to see, even in moderate lighted areas. I didn't try it in bright sunlight and would not expect that to be a good viewing opportunity. The cardboard shipping box didn't hold up well during tansit, but it will suffice. Of all the different types of "spark testers" I researched, this appear to be the better of the inexpensive units.  I am quite satisfied with its performance. 
with plastic bumpers being the norm, thought I'd use this plastic polish.  It brings the shine to the plastic painted areas just like step 2 does to the metal. It fits well on the Jeep JK and looks like it will protect the taillight from things bumping into it.  But like all of these guards produced by different manufacturers, they are attached to the plastic taillight itself.  It will survive the casual bump from putting things into the back but it will do nothing for serious collisions.But like everything from Rugged Ridge, I like it.Even though there are three pages of instructions including pictures the instructions are not very clear.  They provide new screws that are longer than the original but they state to use the two inch screws on the outside of the taillight.  Well, all of the screws are two inch, its just that the two with the larger head and bigger gage go on the outside.  They also state to place the guards on the correct side but there is nothing on the guard to state which is left and right.  The first time I put them on it was dark and the lighting was poor.  The next day it was obvious that I had them reversed; no problem.  Fixed the error in 5 minutes.  They should put some markings on the guards to indicate which is left and right.It has taken me longer to write this review than it did to install the guards.  It should take less than 10 minutes to install them.  It is best to just look at the guards and skip the confusing instructions, use the bigger screws on the outside and spacers go on all corners between the guard and the plastic lens. To stress what other reviewers have said, when you order this "2 Pack" you get what you see in the picture: two chocks, not two sets of chocks.This is a good light-duty set of chocks. They are lightweight, made of durable plastic, and are stackable (like they are in the picture) to save space. They are also bright orange so you don't forget about them when the job is done.The bottom of the chock is slightly serrated, which will give it a decent grip on concrete and asphalt - just make sure you wedge them in well. I would not use these chocks on an incline, on a soft or uneven surface or on a vehicle with a bad parking brake, but for all your normal uses these should do the trick.The two chocks come attached with a plastic fastener. It's a boar to remove, so a pair of pliers is recommended. If you look closely at the picture, you can see holes pre-molded into the lower end of the chock. If you want to keep the two connected but still easily separated for use, I recommend a short length of twine. 
Perfect funnel to pour oil into your crankcase..  This funnel can be used for other purposes of course,.. but I bought it for pouring quart oil into my crankcase. This 30W non-detergent oil is what you should use in your 4 cycle lawn mower or garden tractor.I have a garden tractor with a 26 HP Kohler engine and this 48oz is exactily how much the engine uses when you change the oil and filter. I like not having left over new oil. That lets me use the container for the used oil.  Ordering was convenient and shipping was fast. Ordered several funnels. One for my Auto trans oil. One for filling the Toyota van anti-freeze via the top hose. Faster than filling via the radiator cap. One for the shampoo consolidation in the house. 
I don't need a gallon of this stuff.  I don't need a quart.  I don't even need a pint... so this was the perfect size to have on hand for occaional small engine reassembly and repair. It fit perfectly on my 2005 Mercury Grand Marquis. I don't know why I didn't get one earlier. The gas tank could have been siphoned anytime by anyone. The previous owner just didn't care as the car had been in a garage every day. The new cap is easily unscrewed by one turn of the key. I don't need the plastic strap around the cap as I just set it aside when filling up. I don't have much to say about it. Its a filter. Don't notice any extra &#34;freshness&#34; to the air. I had an old filter and it didn't smell, so this one doesn't add any extra benefit to me. I'll probably just stick to the cheaper filter next time. Definitely change these yourself. DO NOT let your oil change guys do it for you. Look up your car on Youtube and type is cabin filter replacement. I'm sure you'll find a simple step by step video on how to do it yourself. I'm guessing you'll save $30+ 
Does what it says it does......looks great ! Great wheel lock that is easy to activate and unlock.  It comes with 3 keys, one of which has a LED light on it.  The product also comes with a reminder cord that attaches to the handle bar as a reminder.  It does just what I was looking for. The guage has a cheap look and feel without the cover, I agree it should come with the gauge, but since it does not the best thing to do it purchase it.  Each time you grab the gauge you will appreciate the cover and it does help protect it as well.

Part Number:  FL820SManufacturer:  MOTORCRAFTDearborn, MIOE Number  F1AZ 6731 BDOEManufacturer  FordOE Number  XW4E 6714 DAOEManufacturer  FordEngineered specifically for Ford, Lincoln and Mercury vehicles, each Motorcraft oil filter, including the popular Motorcraft FL-1A, uses as many as 12 high-quality components. Construction features include:-  Steel Cases"Ironed" for a precise fit, fluted to ease removal and painted for rust-resistance.-  Pressure Relief ValveWhen it's cold outside or if the filter becomes clogged, oil flow through the filter can be reduced. If this happens, the relief valve opens to provide a continuous oil supply. Its design also minimizes the chance of contaminated oil recirculating back-  Anti-Drain Back ValveThis feature keeps oil in the filter to prevent "dry starts" after your engine has been turned off. It's made with specially formulated material that resists the aging effects that an engine's heat can cause.-  Efficient Filter MediaRe-engineered media increases Motorcraft filters' dirt-collecting capability, allowing them to capture more engine-harming particles than ever before. K&N; Filter Care Service Kit - Squeeze BottleI bought the squeeze bottle version of the kit because I had heard the aerosol spray was difficult to meter accurately. I'm here to say that the squeeze bottle isn't a perfect solution either. I had to oil the Ducati Performance air filter for my 696, which is just a basic cylindrical filter except the "dirty" air comes in from the inside out. A typical conical filter on a car has the dirt collecting on the outside. The airbox on the 696 is set up so the dirt comes from the inside of the filter. This made it extremely difficult to oil properly.On a car filter, oiling the pleats evenly takes a lot of time and excess oil still tends to seep out. It takes some practice, time, and patience - probably a second filter doesn't hurt either.Overall: 4/5 stars, still difficult to oil the filter uniformly but easier to control versus the aerosol spray a must on water pumps, thermostat housings, fuel pump mount to the engine block and on differential covers. also good for a thread sealant. highly satisfied. 
I bought this item to use with my clay bar, this bottle is larger than the bottle that came with the Meguiars claybar kit. Works great...though I noticed the color of the product was diffrent from the smaller bottle from the Meguiars Clay bar kit. Both works the same...good price too.Pretty good product for quick detailing. The bottles are defective and Meguiar's knows and does not care.  I got mine with the Quik Detailer bottle split at the bottom, had leaked everywhere, the towel, mitt and pad soaked.  The products work great, but I am only giving 4 stars because these bottles are a recurring problem.  If the manufacturer fixes the spray bottles and replace them with a bottle that is not cheap plastic, then it would get a 5 star review No problems with the great products but watch the packaging done by Amazon on this one. All of this came individual in a large box not in a Meguiar's kit box. I had to make sure that everything in the picture is what I actually got and it is. 
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. IT WORKS Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. 
Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. This makes it SO easy to charge in conjunction with my battery tender.  So far it has fit all my vehicles batteries ( Acura integra, Toyota Tundra, Toyota Pickup ) 
The tool appears to be of average quality.  However, I returned it to Amazon since it did not fit up to a Ford Taurus flex fuel engine.  This type of engine requires a special fitting that this tool does not have. My unit did not come with any instructions.  The tool seems too complicated to be very useful, but does work. These item does fit perfect on my 2004 BMW x3. does what its suppose to do. so far so good thanks 
Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.  The pickle fork is the last resort for me, as it will damage the balljoint boot.I prefer to use the Snap On balljoint remover.  If that one cannot fit, then I will try this tool.  If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork. Very sticky stuff that will stay where you want it.  It's also very slippery, so should work fine for any motor work you have. I haven't really used it yet for the reason intended, changing the oil in my jet ski.  So, I can't comment on how well it works.  The main reason for this review is to put it out there that it does not work with a 2000 Chevy Silverado.  The siphon tube does not fit thru the bottom of the dip stick tube.  It would be really nice if Mityvac had a published list of what vehicles it works with and what ones it does not.  I have my fingers crossed that it'll work with my jet ski, otherwise there will be a new/(un)used Mityvac on *****'slist.  Long story short, do your research to see if you can confirm or deny if it will work with your vehicle before you buy it. 
There are two horns, not one. One is 400Hz and the other one is 500Hz.PIAA | Automotive Sports Horn (400/500Hz) #85110The are exact fits on the mounts as the OEM horns and use the same bolts. A 1/4 inch drive ratchet and a 12mm socket is needed to remove and install the bolt. They came with grounding leads with ring spade lugs that mounted readily under the existing M6 bolts on the radiator supports. All you need is a 10mm socket.The two wiring harness leads are too short to connect the horns. Two wire tie mounts hold the harness to the aluminum bumper reinforcement. You can cut off the ties and use the OEM harness to connect the horns, but I chose not to.  I prefer NOT to cut off the OEM connector blocks.I made two pigtail extensions out of 18 gauge black primary wire, 5 inches long. One end needs a 1/4 inch wide exposed male quick disconnect. The other end needs an insulated female 1/4 inch quick disconnect terminal. Since I used 18 gauge wire, I used the red coded ones.The exposed male connector slides into the OEM horn connector perfectly. The female one clips easily onto the positive terminal of each horn.The horns how have a weather shield on the apertures.Best thing to my surprise is that they appear to be very high quality and Made in Japan.Also nice is that they need no modification to the horn relay or circuit. OEM quality, as mentioned, made in Japan.  The only gripe is the OEM cap has Honda screws that are have washer locks on them to keep them on the cap and thus less likely to drop while removing them.  The replacement screws are separate.  The cap also comes with a replacement gasket.TIP:  Always replace plug wires one at a time from the old cap to the new cap in the same order/rotation you pull from.May as well replace the rotor and coil while you are at it:Beck Arnley  173-7988  Ignition RotorOEM 5100A Ignition Coil I bought this belt for my 2003 Chevy Tahoe with the 5.3L engine and 145A Alternator. Make sure you know which alternator you have BEFORE purchasing this belt. The 105A alternators use a slightly shorter belt. It fits perfectly, doesn't make any noise and works great! You will also need the smallerGoodyear 4040377 Gatorback Poly V-Beltfor the A/C system on these vehicles.My 145 Amp Alternator has a 145A stamped on the side, visible from the drivers side. You could also look for the old belt part number on the existing belt and order accordingly.

The tool appears to be of average quality.  However, I returned it to Amazon since it did not fit up to a Ford Taurus flex fuel engine.  This type of engine requires a special fitting that this tool does not have. Nobody else has mentioned it.  This is the K&N size for anyone who uses the Ford FL1A.  It also works in place of the Derale 13092. Exact fit for Lexus RX300. As easy to install as I could've expected with all parts: the sensor, the cable and  the plug matching the original layout. 
I purchased this belt for my 2003 Chevy Tahoe. I had no idea Chevy would put 2 serpentines on a newer generation vehicle. This smaller belt fits the A/C system only. It works like a champ and fits perfectly. I would recommend the Gatorback belts to EVERYONE! As an installation side note, you have to remove the air intake and larger serpentine to get to this "bottom of the motor" mounted unit.... way to engineer that one GM! Works great, nice to have a second cable, but the OBD end of the cable is angled.  In my case, this cable won't work on my Subaru Outback.  I would prefer the option of a straight OBD connector.  Note that the angle connector works on my other four cars (Mazda, Honda, Dodge). I bought this belt for my 2003 Chevy Tahoe with the 5.3L engine and 145A Alternator.

It seems the oxygen sensor is one of the more common failures that cause check engine codes to appear on the OBDII (engine and emissions control) computer system. This is the correct GM Oil Canister Socket for most of the new GM engines. If you think your 1-1/4&#34; or 32mm Sockets or wrenches will work you're gonna be all pissed off, buy this special socket now and save yourself for a huge problem. 
If you are a do it yourselfer with auto repairs , this is a good tool to have in your tool box just in case. I needed to replace the inner tie rod on my 97 Corolla. I have a fairly well equiped shop but needed this specialty tool to do the job.This tool allowed me to remove the inner tie rod lock nut with ease. It has several difference sizes of fittings that allow it to be used on other vehicles.This tool paid for itself by me doing the job. It is well made and worth the price. Works as advertised. Very easy to manipulate to get to the valve stem to check pressure on my motorcycle. It should since that is what is was made for. 
I use it every day and not just for calipers. I use it on battery chargers when I have to charge a battery and have to work underneath the car so it supports the charger on the lift I am very pleased with this battery maintainer.  I purchased the cigarette light plug along with this unit and it is so easy to use.  I plugged it in, set it to normal charge and brought a totally discharged battery back to life.  The battery is holding the charge just fine and I couldn't be happier.  I especially like the &#34;supply&#34; mode on this unit so I can change out a battery without losing the codes on my car.  No one should be without this charger.  I have a car that sits in the garage and used sparingly and this device keeps the battery fully charged. I have used this charger many times to charge the battery in a car that sits outside and I rarely drive. The voltage and percent charge display is very nice.  Very easy to use 
I ordered 2 different chargers to maintain my gate opener's deep cycle battery (a simple 4 output charger with extension cords for charging other deep cycle batteries from amazonBattery Tender 022-0148-DL-WH 12V 4-Bank Battery Management System) and this unit has a far superior charging design.The 4 bank battery tender does a simple fast rate charge then switches to a trickle charge at a constant voltage with 4 outputs.This unit pulses the battery under charge and features 3 operating modes with different current outputs for different sized batteries. The selections are motorcycle which also works well for SLA gel cells or AGM batteries, standard automotive starting battery, deep cycle batttery, and off.What makes the CTEK unit special is that it uses a pulse charge in all modes to attempt to desulphate batteries, while the battery tender does not.  This method of charging has proven successful in restoring lead acid batteries that won't take a charge any more.It comes with a waterproof 12V output cable and a set of clips or rings for permanent installation under the hood of your car.  In addition to the LEDs for indicating the type of battery being charged, a second set is provided for empty, 1/2 full, and maintenance pulse charge mode.There is also a noticable increase in quality between the battery tender and this unit - small details like a water sealed housing and gaskets on the connectors indicate quality in manufacture.For a single 12V lead chemistry battery this is a useful, well made tool. This is a factory replacement for a Honda Rincon. Easy to fill and charge, works great. Sealed battery and should last quite some time in conjunction with my Battery Tender Jr. The Battery Tender Junior 12V Charger comes complete with everything needed to charge your 12V battery.  I purchased this model to specifically charge my motorcycle battery and I am pleased to say that the unit works great.  It is a very compact charger and is supplied with several attachments to ensure that your battery is kept in an optimum condition.I made the permanent hard wire attachment to my battery using the color coded leads connected directly to the appropriate positive & negative terminals on the battery. The opposite female end has an end cap which can cover the inlet when not in use. When I know that I will not be hitting the road for an extended period of time, I simply plug the unit in to maintain my existing battery's power supply.Battery Tender makes larger charging units, but this battery charger is great for charging everything from batteries for ATV's and motorcycles to scooters and lawn mowers. Because of it's very discreet size it does not take up any needed space. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to protect their battery investment and do not want to compromise space and versatility. 
No issues, just as described.  Used to connect my motorcycle to Battery Tender charger.  Also connect to adapter to charge my cell phone. This works well with the power port I bought and have not had problems except feed back on the phone when charging the phone and having it hooked up to an AMP. Installed in a friends van so he can charge his PC and cell phone when he camps.  I had to cut off the clamps and solder wiring with a fuse and on/off switch directly to the battery.  Created a 250 watt draw and the inverter didn't even get warm.  So 400 watts should not be a problem.  I would buy this unit again, 
Clever item. You can push all your refrigerator items back and hold them there while traveling. To lengthen, you have to unscrew the upper and bottom rod. Then you have to twist them while holding in place in the fridge to tighten them. Then you need Sta-Bil. Leaving gas sit around in cans or lawn equipment and it starts to break down. Sta-Bil prevents that from happening. allows me to keep my charger in the garage, and my lower in the back of my house. 25' is just the right lenght, and the end has a cover so i can hang the cood out side and not worry about rain. 
I love it. Can also use to leave vehicle outside so the BatteryMinder ( Tender ) stays dry in the garage, if it rains outside. A must have for me. I want to protect this wonderful charger and keep it on the shelf, not under the hood in a hot engine bay. when I park for awhile or need to take my Engel refrigerator/freezer in my car into the house or hotel room, this does the trick of keeping it powered up. Bought this to keep the battery fully charged when I store my mustang for the winter.  Does a great job at keeping it charged and if I ever try to turn the car on it starts up right away.  With new cars constantly draining the batteries, I think this is a must if your car sits for more than a week. 
3 weeks ago my CEL light came on.  The car ran fine, there was no sensation of a defect.  I could pull the battery and wait 5 minutes, which is a reset spec for OBD II without a reader, but what if the issue was serious, later on?  Calling the car dealership, a diagnostic ran $75.  A Toyota TSB released in 2006 said a common issue was simply a loose gas cap.  I tightened it, and tried to reset the CEL.  No go.  Ordered the reader, as I'll need it anyway for other issues as they arise with the CEL.  Followed the instruction, diagnosed the issue, checked it against the Toyota troubleshooting manual, and presto, CEL is gone.  For $47 versus the $75, not only is the problem fixed, I know how to do it [ priceless!] and I now have a tool to diagnose these pesky electronic computer modules that feeds data to the CEL, just to insure the dealership is up to snuff, or I can fix it myself [sometimes it can be just a loose hose.]It rates 4/5 for 2 reasons:The cord is short.  Its OK, but the unit will not raise to a comfortable chest height connected to the OBD II jack, one has to crouch down;No backlight, crouched in the dark driver pedal area, a small LED or something would help a ton, given how dark it is down there and the cabin light doesn't light one's feet.Other than that, its so simple even a cave man can do it. With so many vehicles, I needed to replace my 25 year old unit.  This uses dual power, so at home I can plug into AC; on the road the 12 volt plug in my car.  I like the auto shut off feature when pressure achieved. This product was easy enough to install, as I'm electronically inclined.  However, I ran into a bit of an issue after the installation was completed and the unit was programmed -- it failed to control my Kenwood DNX6960 reliably.  Sometimes it worked for every button press; sometimes it didn't work, at all.  Sometimes it worked for all buttons; other times only some buttons functioned.I triple-checked everything (which was fine) and then began researching the problem.  While researching I stumbled across a bulletin from the manufacturer.  Apparently some of the SWI-JACK units were mis-soldered at the factory and fail to operate Kenwood head units even when properly wired into place.  Wow, just wow... talk about bad quality control.Fortunately mine was properly soldered on the inside.  Sadly, though, this didn't help me find a solution.  Ultimately I lived with the sporadic functionality of the unit until my Metra Axxess ASWC arrived.  I'm much happier with the Axxess ASWC.  It uses a steering wheel control wire off the radio harness rather than needing to be connected directly to the vehicle's BCM.  It also auto-detects the head unit (it may need a 12k reisstor in the line [only during auto-detection] for some Kenwood head units, but the DNX6960 isn't one of them) -- meaning no programming is necessary.  And it's competitively priced.  I strongly recommend the Metra Axxess ASWC over the PAC SWI-JACK unless you just -have- to have a PAC SWI-JACK -- especially if you're working on a GM truck in conjunction with a Kenwood head unit. 
**Edit - If you take something away from my post, it is that automakers design cars to run on specific spark plugs. Buy whatever works great for you car, and avoid spark plugs that don't run well. These didn't work in my car, but everyone is different. Check forums to see what works best as well.**I drive a 1998 Honda Civic EX with a VTEC engine. I am currently running NGK V-Power spark plugs and the original factory spark plug wires. I bought these spark plugs to see fuel economy gains and maybe a power increase while merging onto the freeway.They work, but I couldn't tell they were new. MPG's for my car went down to 36, usually 38-40, and so the price didn't match the product well. What I can tell you is that using the right spark plug for your car is key, and trying to eeek out extra MPG's from spark plugs doesn't work so well. I tried Autolites, NGK, etc. iridium plugs and the traditional copper cores work the best. I get 45-50 mpg highway on standard spark plugs.So save your money (I think I spent $16-24 for the set, it's been a while since I returned them) and buy 3-4 sets of copper core NGK V-Power plugs or whatever fits your car.The other thing to note is that replacing severley worn spark plugs with these will net fuel economy gains, but putting any new plugs in will do that. Don't be fooled by these fancy plugs. Shop for your car and check what your car is recommended to use, because that is usually the best option. Your car's computer is programed for the original plugs, not different ones.It's your money, but read the reviews to see if it helps your specific car. It didn't do anything for mine.One plus is that Amazon is amazing with returns. Sure the switch placement sucks,but I do like the pump overall.I can plug in to a 120 outlet or use the 12 volt car accessory outlet. I used this product on spark plugs ends before installing plug wires or coil packs. I also use it on any electrical connection that may come in contact with moisture. I highly recommend purchasing this if you do a lot electrical work. 
How do you rate these?  They do exactly what they are supposed to do.  What more can I say.  It don't stink no more?!  LOL How can one really rate it, as it is used for protection and no idae how long it should last, yet is was as listed so I give it the benifit ogf the doubt... I probably should compare it to another to see how accurate it is, but I really like how easy it is to use and turns off and on by itself. 
I preferr this over the other brands due to warranty. Battery Tender warranty a joke, They charge shipping and repair cost under their warranty. I replaced my Battery Tender w/ these. I have used this brand on my tractor and 4 wheelers. I am getting over 5 years of battery life on both w/ this. I did a bit of research before purchasing this product. If you want a quick charge, I have read that your battery won't last as long. For battery life, the ideal charge is low amerage.  I appreciate that this charger provides a low amp charge to the battery. I had an older battery charger that I believe prematurely destroyed one of my 12v batteries, so I did my best to find the best value replacement. As a matter of fact, the way I saw the older charger behaving (according to my digital multimeter), I was concerned that it could cause the battery to explode or start a fire. I decided to get a new one. I looked at all of the battery chargers I could find on Amazon and other sites. Eventually, I settled on this particular model for these reasons:1. Provides a low amperage charge, which is supposed to help prolong battery life.2. Desulphination mode, which is supposed to help prolong battery life.3. Safety shutoff features, so that it doesn't overcharge the battery.4. Reads the battery polarity and illuminates a red light if you have it reversed.5. Excellent review on Amazon and other sites that sell battery chargers.I've only been using the battery minder for a couple of months, but I think it is working well. The recharges and maintenance modes seem appropriate. The batteries seem to last a long time after I charge them. This product seems to be living up to the claims and ratings. I am impressed. This is a very nice charger for many batteries, BUT it states AGM (not good for many). An AGM 12VDC VMAX, or Optima type RV or marine battery requires a special charger that will deliver 25-35 Amps, not 8. This is for a very small AGM battery. This cost over $120 and I will use it for regular flooded lead batteries but must buy another for AGM or Gel batteries for my RV. A specialty battery requires a specialty charger, I found out. I do recommend this, would buy again, and I hope this helps.

I own 4 Battery Tenders, one each for my rarely driven Corvette, my wife's BMW Convertible (both driven less than 2K mi per year and stored for 4 months per year), my standby generator, and my lawn tractor.  The BMW's battery is now 8 years old, the Corvettes is 5 years old, the generators is 3 and the tractor is only a year old.  Based on the BMW, I expect to get a lot more life from the other batteries to. 
Below is the formula:1/3: to the manifold (using brake booster)1/3: to the fuel tank1/3: to the engineYour engine will be much cleaner. Remember: do it at night, otherwise, you will scare your neighbor with dark smoke. This Actron CP9125 is an invaluable tool in that it allows you to clear the CEL (check engine light) without having to disconnect the battery and risk possibly causing another problem.  If, for example, your gas cap is left loose and the CEL comes on, you can immediately reset the CEL rather than panic and go to the stealership.  But most people don't realize the OBD-II (on-board diagnostics) will actually self reset after a number of cycles, but few people understand the testing cycle process. you cars computer (ECU/PCM)  monitors the tank for pressure; if you lose tank pressure,  (bad)any autostore can scan yOUR CAR for free, and see "P0440 to P0499 and others.)  EVAP failure , in laymen terms the tank leaks  fumes (nasty smog it is)you can buy a scan tool for $7 , off some bay dot com.  sure can.you can look up the error codes called DTCs at any time for free, there,http://www.myscantool.com/dtc/powertrain.htmlmy 02 jeep wrangler has a bad cap, and is on recall, (look up TSB)  and has a revised cap if buying one new from dealer.all 2002 caps are bad, they slip and will not come off, standing you.the dealer is not cheating you if you drive in , and the CEL (check engine lamp is out)  he cant fix it, if it is not broke. or throwing DTCs./These fact apply to all cars 1996 to Present, it's not something new, or unique at all.The ecu can be rest (scan tool) after replacing the cap or you can wait for 3 driving cycles to clear it. its your choice.There is a third way to reset, but varies by car, the ECU memory input power.  you pull a fuse and the ECU forgets and resets, to a new car settings.the cap has  a vacuum breaker inside, if you use a cap that has none, you will collapse your tank and destroy the fuel pump rack and sometimes the pump.so getting a real OEM spec. cap, will save all that bad news....ymmv, retired, mech. 
If the charging system is completely dead and the engine is running on battery voltage only, this monitor will display green (as in everything is okay) as it it goes into battery check mode.  While the low display voltage will tell you something is definitely wrong with the charging system, the green light can be a little misleading. Pros: battery driven; flashing or steady light; flameless flare; can be used as a map light; reusable. Could be used effectively as a light that does not seriously degrade night vision.Cons: Product claims to be visible at 1000 ft, but this is only possible within a few degrees of view. One half of the top lights up for a dim presentation, but the bright LED shines out through a narrow beam like a small red flashlight. Consequently, the flare would probably not be useful in a traffic situation since it would have to be precisely aligned with oncoming traffic and would only be visible by the few drivers within this narrow beam of light. It is certainly not a good substitute for a real flare which is much brighter and omnidirectional. This little light is not as good as the emergency flashers built into vehicles.If you want a safety flare to carry in your vehicle, buy the real thing. If you want a light you can use as a map light without distracting a driver, or to see where you're walking without seriously degrading your night vision, this red light will do that well. It is smart to give warning lights as it can differentia between battery and alternator voltage. 
would recommend getting a  size  smaller than  what the  &#34;sizing chart&#34; recommends  as  I  measure aroun my leg  as  recommended  and  the chaps  were  one size too large.. otherwise they are  awesome  quality and build The meter has all the functions you could ask for a multimeter in a compact size.  The digits are large for the size of the meter, so it's easily readable by middle aged eyes. This is one-size-fits-most. It works on the filter for my 2002 Volkswagen Passat, but it's too large to grip the filter on my 1993 Chevrolet S10. 
i use these for aftermarket batteries for 12v power wheels. can charge with a battery tender and fit together nicely Of all the battery chargers on the market, the Battery Tender is the best.  The device is small and portable, works exceptionally well for maintaining batteries and does not over charge (over charging can decrease the overall life of your battery).  It is simple to operate and can be left hooked up to a dormant battery while it is not in use.  The Battery Tender can be used while the battery is hooked up to a vehicle/mower/etc. or not.  Highly recommended. I comparison shop a lot before buying anything - hopefully you can benefit from my time investment and review. The Battery Tender Alligator clips allow me to charge a battery without having to install the ring type terminals on the positive and negative posts.  I can also charge a battery without having to remove it from a vehicle or removing the cables from the battery.  A very handy item to use with my Deltran 4-bank charger. 
with plastic bumpers being the norm, thought I'd use this plastic polish.  It brings the shine to the plastic painted areas just like step 2 does to the metal. Very quick and easy mounting and really adds to the look of the rear of the Jeep.  These are metal and not a cheap plastic and mount with included screws into the existing lens cover screw holes. Good quality R.V. water heater drain valve. Brass construction with a steel finger tip handle built in. A vital component when winterizing or just performing general maintenance. Teflon tape will seal threads upon install. Great replacement for older leaking or rusty valves. 
We've used this on a dark blue Infiniti, a silver Honda and a black Honda, with beautiful shiny results on all cars.  Being that we don't polish our cars as often as many, this product is very much appreciated because it is easy to apply, doesn't have an unpleasant smell, and it gives great results with a lovely shine to the enamel.  The polish is thinner in viscosity than some we've used, but I think that adds to the ease in application.  Apply a thin coat, let it dry a little, then polish it off and you will be thrilled with the "new look" of your car.  My only recommendation is to be sure you do not do this in the sun or on a hot day while the car body is hot to the touch.  In those conditions, the polish dries very fast and the results are not as great as when you have the time to really polish with a clean cloth.  This has worked on bicycles with great success, too! I have a dark colored car, so I purchased one of those "black" tinted spray waxes which claimed it also cleans and shines black plastic and metal trim.  Wrong.  I also use a regular (not black) liquid spray polish detailer.  It's okay on regular black plastic and window trim surfaces.But neither could clean the paste wax residue ruining the look of the textured black plastic on top of my rear bumper.  But Mothers Back-to-Black certainly did.  Now my car looks showroom new again.The product is a cream colored liquid (not black).  So my product applicator (an old sock) and my wiping cloth (an old t-shirt, both from my husband) aren't stained.  I'm very happy and I would I highly recommend this product to everyone. This is great wax! It truly deserves the Gold Class name. I use this after the Meguiar's Ultimate Polish. I also have migrated to a 6 in buffer/polisher. I used to do all of my polishing and waxing by hand, and with the buffer, this turns out great. I have an 89 LeSabre that is Black Sapphire in color. Before using the polish/wax combo, it looked more like a darker blue. Nothing really deep. After polishing and waxing, it now looks like the black in black sapphire. It looks great in the shade, as it should and looks beautiful in the sun. There is a nice deep, glassy color, and I am pleased with the results. The water also beads very nice, too. 
I just finished my first spring washing when a fellow walked by my car and asked if this was 2011 CRV that I waswashing. I told him it was almost 4 years old and he could not believe it. I have to admit that the car does look like due to wonderful Mothers products and some elbow grease.Mothers Carnauba Wax is one of the weapons in keeping my car looking good.I start by washing my car. I don't dry it as this time as water drops will be removed by other steps. Then I clay the car to remove embedded specs, stuck on dirt, and this year I had rubber marks from clearing the snowMothers 07240 California Gold Clay Bar Paint Saving System. I don't clay every inch of the entire car. I just examine the car by sight for any imperfections and by my running my hand over the paint to feel any tiny bumps. When I feel some grittiness or see some dirt on the paint, I generously spray that section with Mothers Showtime Instant Detailer, then knead the piece of clay in my hand and rub it against the spot I identified. Normally, you see the dirt disappear in a few swipes. Sometimes you need to reapply the Detailer and repeat. Kneading is important as you want to work the little pieces of dirt into the clay, and not leave it on the surface of the clay ball where it can scratch the car. I also use the clay on non-painted areas such as glass and chrome if they have stains.After the claying step I wax the car is small sections using Carnauba Wax. It easy to work with.  I put it on a small section (each side of the car is done in 4 sections, for example), by the time I am done spreading it, it is ready to be wiped off, you don't have to wait.  I use micro fiber towels to wipe the wax, using a fresh piece of the fiber on each section.As my final step I apply Back-to-blackMothers 06108 Back-To-Black - 8 ozto non-painted surfaces. This turns the dull plastic into shiny new looking surface. Back-to-black is also effective in removing any wax that might have accidently got on the plastic, that's why I do back-to-black as the last step.Carnauba Wax gives a superior shine.  It is easy and pleasant to work with.  I highly recommend it. I began with Step 1 Polish, and Step 2 Micro-Polish and Glaze, and finished up with the Step 3 Wax, using the Mothers Powerball 4Paint.  The Powerball put the wax on smoothly and uniformly, and after doing Step 1 and Step 2, my hands welcomed the break using the Powerball.  The car looks a brilliant white now.  With all the work preparing the finish, I put 3 coats of wax on it.  The car is a full-size, and there is enough Step 1 and Step 2 to do at least another car, and despite the 3 coats of wax, there is still enough in the bottle for maybe another 2 or 3 wax jobs.  Very pleased with the 3 Step process, and the Powerball. If you are going to wax your vehicle (which you should about twice a year in a cool spot in the shade) you should evaluate the clear and if it has a lot of swirl marks you should consider polishing the car and then waxing it. I like to do the mothers three step process polish, micro polish, and wax but i still had some of this so i used this as step one. 
I too am an automotive detailer, I've used this product for quite some time.  It used to be called all wheel cleaner but is not called all wheel and tire cleaner.I don't get the negative reviews,  this product works great for many applications.  Applications as in, wheels, tires, and even plastic wheel wells where gritty dirt accumulates.Wet the wheel down, make sure it's cold, you don't want to apply this or anything for that matter to an extremely hot surface.. Work one wheel at a time, rinse, apply product, let sit a few seconds SCRUB the tire and wheel with a SOFT to MODERATE bristle brush, and rinse away... You shouldn't have a problem and you should see a dramatic improvement.Cons:  this stuff isn't cheap and it doesn't last for more than about 3 sets of 4 tires and wheels.  Use it only when completely necessary.  If you wash your car often DON'T use this all of the time unless your budget is better than mine.  Use your car wash detergent or even dawn dish soap along with the above described method of application removal.  It rids wheels and tires of light soil quite well.Be careful with this stuff though... It is not for ALL wheels like it says it is.  Meguiars Also make a milder chrome and mag cleaner as well as, aluminum wheel cleaner. KRUD KUTTER, I applaud your efforts at 'green' cleaning, however you disappoint this consumer when it comes to one specific area - mildew removal."Cleans what ordinary cleaners simply can't!" doesn't seem to cover mildew as stated on your label.  To me, that's a basic and one that's a pretty good test for any cleaner, particularly biodegradable ones that are not designed to bleach, but rather to eat away stains.What KRUD KUTTER can do is offer a color fast, fabric safe, 'earth friendly' cleaning solution to help you clean up things that are sticky, greasy, oily or waxy. It is good at basic clean-ups, but what it can't do is everything it claims on the bottle.Perhaps my expectations were just too high, and perhaps it was my experience with another product, but this one is just OK to me, thus the 3 out of 5 stars.What I like about KRUD KUTTER:+ Earth-friendly; always a good thing.+ Concentrated; all jobs don't need full-strength use, thus the product lasts longer in theory.+ 'Safely' removes... although this one is questionable as there are warnings about eye and skin contact, as well as ingestion.+ It does work on things like shoe scuffs on vinyl and wood flooring, without bleaching the surface.+ It cuts common dirt and grease very well at full strength, including hairspray residue.+ Biodegradable, thus safe for use on RV's, boats, and plumbing that feeds to a septic tank.What I don't like about KRUD KUTTER:- The very first thing I tried to clean was mildew spots on my bathroom ceiling (a teenager who likes long showers and doesn't turn on the fan...), and at full-strength with 3 applications - it did not go away. I began to see them lighten, but they did not go away completely via just spraying and leaving the cleaner to do its work.  Eventually I wiped things down and it looks OK, but the bottom line on mildew - a bleach solution still works better, as doesSimple Green 11001 Clean Building All-Purpose Concentrate Cleaner, 1 Gallon Bottle.  Might just want to scratch 'mildew' off the list for this product, or not put so much hype on the bottle.- If it works, most jobs require full strength application, despite what it says on the label regarding dilutions.For sticky, greasy jobs this cleaner works well.  But I'm not completely sold that its claims match what it can do on all fronts.  A good, Earth-friendly cleaning product, but not an 'all-purpose' one.If you want to try another product for greasy and sticky jobs, that I like better, I would recommend tryingSpray Nine 22732 Grez-Off Heavy Duty Degreaser, 32 oz.instead, which is also biodegradable and works incredibly well!  Spray Nine's product is least 80% more effective on sticky and greasy messes than KRUD KUTTER, and it costs less too.Although it too, is not for mildew.UPDATE: 7/8/13I've boosted my rating from 3 to 4 stars for this product.  The more I use it, the better I like it, particularly for sticky residue on vinyl flooring.  A wet mop with a quick spray of this lightly over the surface, seems to do a better job on my kitchen and bathroom floor than any other cleaners I've found.  It's not as heavy-duty as Spray Nine, but the fumes are much less too and if used frequently there's no need to use a stronger product. I have used this solvent a number of times to remove adhesive and badging from my cars.  For that it works wonderfully.  When used modestly it does not effect automotive surfaces or glass.  Since this stuff is so potent, I would recommend using the the spray straw in the nozzle so that you can more carefully target where you spray this stuff.  You want to be very careful where you put it.  It also evaporates rapidly so you need to work quickly when you use it.Just to reinforce a few precautions:- Do not get this on plastic (it will discolor it) or any soft/organic materials.- Do not use around high eat, as it is extremely flammable- Limit all bodily exposureOverall this is a wonderful product, just be very careful how you use it. 
This dries my car very well and stops water spots from forming. I dried my car almost completely (Scion tC) before I had to squeeze water out of this towel. It really is a water magnet! I live in an apartment with an attached indoor parking lot, so no water hose or anything.Every weekend (as best as I can), I head down there with a bag containing this No Rinse solution, a microfiber sponge, a couple of towels, a Windex spray, a gallon of water in a bottle, and a bucket. 2 caps of the No Rinse and 20 minutes later, my car is clean and shiny. No hassle, no water wasting, no hose needed. 
I just finished my first spring washing when a fellow walked by my car and asked if this was 2011 CRV that I waswashing. I told him it was almost 4 years old and he could not believe it. I have to admit that the car does look like due to wonderful Mothers products and some elbow grease.Mothers Carnauba Wax is one of the weapons in keeping my car looking good.I start by washing my car.

It is easy and pleasant to work with.  I highly recommend it. I've always had great experiences with Meguiar's products. This stuff works great and I used it on a Black car. A black car is very hard to keep the paint looking show room. I've used Detailing spray from local auto stores and they got nothing on this Meguiar's product. This stuff does not leave any smears but only if you use it under the sun it does and its very easy to wipe clean. This stuff removed deep water stains with ease that my car had, just use it under shade and cool car and you'll get a show room quality car. I've owned a black car for 25 years and keeping it clean and keeping swirls out for the paint is tough. So I bought another black car but this time I searched you tube for car care and found things about &#34;claying&#34; your car. I thought &#34;no way&#34; I'm going to rub a bar of clay on my black car, that would just scratch it to death. Well I was wrong, even after a good cleaning there is still dirt particles in the paint, just do the plastic bag test and you will see. I used the clay bar as instructed and it deep cleaned the surface and in turn I could seal the paint after the claying job. It does an amazing job on cleaning your paint. I have used it to remove scuff marks, bird doo, bugs, about anything that is on your paint. 
If you have not used a clay bar, I can tell you that it really does work and it is extremely easy to use. Do not be afraid to complete a few extra passes with it. This is actually step 3 out of 4 steps. The first is to wash your car, then polish it, then clay bar the car, then use Megiuars Tech 2.0 polymer sealer. The clay bar step is actually effortless. You just have to remember not to drop the clay, and do extra passes/wipes, a small section (12&#34; x 12&#34;) at a time. The last few passes with the clay bar you can use the weight of the clay itself. One reviewer wrote that this was too mild and it did not remove a lot of contaminants. This is because he may be missing the &#34;polishing step&#34;. The &#34;contaminants&#34; should come off with the washing and polishing. The clay bar is for removing fine contaminants. Your paint will be very smooth and silky. That is no joke either; it really feels smooth. The car will then be ready for a polymer-sealant or a wax if you prefer.In Summary: Step 1 Wash your car with Megiuars Gold Class (better than the stinky yellow hazy Meguiars Ultimate Wash). Step 2 - Polish it with either of the following depending on the contaminants. Feel the paint. Is there a lot of grittiness ? Then you may want to use Megiuars medium/fine cut cleaner. The medium cut cleaner will remove some heavy duty water spots that you just cannot get out with anything else. If you do use the &#34;medium cut cleaner&#34;, then you may want to use a &#34;swirl remover&#34; after this step. If your paint feels all right (a small amount of grittiness), then a normal &#34;polish&#34; (Megiuars Ultimate Compound is great) will work just fine. Helpful hint. Purchase an inexpensive sponge, not a real loop sponge, one of those large smooth cheapy sponges for $1.75. If you use a round hand applicator, you may obtain a zebra stripe pattern. The zebra pattern means that the product is working, but your fingers are smashing down more than the applicator portion in between your fingers. You need an even pressure and your large cheapy sponge will achieve that. I also tried a large circular sponge applicator for my drill and that actually worked very well and it saved my arm a bit too. The circular applicator for my drill achieved the best results. I had major hard water spot damage that I just could not get out. Always remember that even though the paint appears very good after this step has been completed, do not stop at this step. There is no protection and your paint needs it since you just removed the protection. Step 3 - Clay Bar your car - use this kit or &#34;Mothers&#34;, although since I am writing a review in Megiuars product, use it. It works very well. Follow the directions. Use medium to light pressure. The last pass can be the weight of your clay and hand. I usually use 10-12 passes. Do not be afraid to make extra passes. The clay is really non-abrasive, and almost effortless to use. Complete the entire car. Do not drop the clay. If you do drop it there may be some grit hiding in the clay and you will scratch the heck out of your paint. I have used it after I dropped it, but it is a hassle removing the top layer of the clay that dropped. Step 4 - Waxing time - There are many many decisions to be made on this step. The different types of wax and sealants, paste wax, liquid wax will confuse even the most experienced car enthusiast. Do you enjoy waxing your vehicle every other week or once a month ? Then a very good quality Carnuba wax will work for you. Do you want the shine to last for 90 days or so ? The poly-sealant is right for you. Do you want to use a &#34;paste wax&#34; and enjoy a good workout for your biceps and triceps? Then a good paste wax is good for you. For me I want the shine to last for 90 days with minimal amount of effort to apply and remove. This is why I use Megiuars Tech 2.0 Wax which is technically not a wax at all, it is a synthetic polymer that shines very well. It will also last about 3 times longer than the carnuba wax and it is very easy to apply and remove. If you absolutely hate waxing your car and you do not mind the wonderful chemical smell, the once a year Nu Finish is actually a very good deal. It may not last a full year, but i tell you what, it is really close to it. I have used it and it works very well. It is also about $7 - $8 a can. Be sure to seal it up after you use it though, as it will age if you do not seal it up. But boy does it stink !!!  Have fun it is a great hobby !! Works very well and is easy to work with. Make sure you use gloves because you will get splinters in your hands if you don't. I have been fixing up an old gas powered scooter and the tires were in need of replacement.  You really need a good set of tire irons to remove the tires and these did the trick.  They don't do anything to protect the wheels, so go easy when removing.  Simple to use and provides lots of leverage. 
This product is a MUST have for anyone who does any type of electrical work (automotive, motorcycle, marine, etc) as it stops any corrosion from starting up or protecting a cleaned up connector... It does exactly what it's supposed to do. No problems whatsoever. Does what it says it does......looks great ! 
This worked great to make my vinyl look good inside. Not good like shiny-glistening, but good like Rich and Full. I have a little red rocket (WRX) and it looks so NICE now! very good Very good.... 
My unit did not come with any instructions.  The tool seems too complicated to be very useful, but does work. Nice brush.  Does what it is made to do and cleanup is easy.  Which the handle was longer so I could get deeper into the drum. Does what it says it does......looks great ! 
I use this on my dark grey Ford Explorer because the Ohio license plates are white. This looks very nice on the dark vehicle and I have  not experienced any troubles with law enforcement in the state of Ohio for the shield being too dark. I purchased this product based on positive reviews by amazon.com customers to restore the rear trim on my 1998 Buick Riviera. While it makes a nice shine, Back to Black did NOT make the trim black again; it remains grey. I expected a more drastic improvement, like some of the tire shine products.In fact, I tried Black Magic &#34;Tire Wet&#34; on the rear trim, and it provides at least as good a shine as Back to Black.Bottom line : product is okay, but will not by any means restore black trim back to black This is great wax! It truly deserves the Gold Class name. I use this after the Meguiar's Ultimate Polish. I also have migrated to a 6 in buffer/polisher. I used to do all of my polishing and waxing by hand, and with the buffer, this turns out great. I have an 89 LeSabre that is Black Sapphire in color. Before using the polish/wax combo, it looked more like a darker blue. Nothing really deep. After polishing and waxing, it now looks like the black in black sapphire. It looks great in the shade, as it should and looks beautiful in the sun. There is a nice deep, glassy color, and I am pleased with the results. The water also beads very nice, too. 
Part Number:  FL820SManufacturer:  MOTORCRAFTDearborn, MIOE Number  F1AZ 6731 BDOEManufacturer  FordOE Number  XW4E 6714 DAOEManufacturer  FordEngineered specifically for Ford, Lincoln and Mercury vehicles, each Motorcraft oil filter, including the popular Motorcraft FL-1A, uses as many as 12 high-quality components. Construction features include:-  Steel Cases"Ironed" for a precise fit, fluted to ease removal and painted for rust-resistance.-  Pressure Relief ValveWhen it's cold outside or if the filter becomes clogged, oil flow through the filter can be reduced. If this happens, the relief valve opens to provide a continuous oil supply. Its design also minimizes the chance of contaminated oil recirculating back-  Anti-Drain Back ValveThis feature keeps oil in the filter to prevent "dry starts" after your engine has been turned off. It's made with specially formulated material that resists the aging effects that an engine's heat can cause.-  Efficient Filter MediaRe-engineered media increases Motorcraft filters' dirt-collecting capability, allowing them to capture more engine-harming particles than ever before. THIS IS THE PERFECT TIRE PRESSURE GAUGE FOR CHECKING TIRE PRESSURE ACCURATELY, QUICKLY AND EASILY.  SIMPLY PUT THE END OVER THE VALVE STEM, HOLD IT FIRMLY FOR A SECOND OR TWO AND READ THE PRESSURE.  THE GAUGE ON THE NEW TIRE PUMP IS NOT CORRECT AND NEITHER IS THE PRESSURE GAUGE ON THE ELECTRIC TIRE PUMP THAT ATTACHES TO THE CIGARETTE LIGHTER. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE ACCUTIRE MS DIGITAL TIRE PRESSURE GAUGE. I am working on my own truck and am not a mechanic.  I have not used the pump on the truck, yet, but just tested the pump for functions and leaks.This pump has 2 functions: vacuum and pressure, which are selected with a knob on the side.  The pressure release valve has a large handle, but this makes it easy to accidentally release the pressure.  The gauge swivels, so the gauge must be fitted with an o ring.  It comes with a nice case and all the little parts has their own places.For both vacuum and pressure, nothing leaked for at least 20 minutes.For about $72.00, Mityvac beats the Lisle vacuum pump (single function and came with broken pressure release valve) handily.Even though it will be extra expense, I plan to look for a bigger container for draining brake fluid.  I bought a rubber cork stopper to see if I can make my own air tight container. 
I've been using this product for years, and it's the best out there. It is low gloss, and a little goes a LONG way. I use this on more than just my car. Basically anything made of plastic that I need to condition and protect, I apply this product to. In my opinion, the other major competitor that "armors everything" doesn't live up to the hype, and in fact can in some cases cause you more headaches than save you. Plus, it's gone up in price quite a bit. Pay a little more and buy a better product. The Lexol leather conditioner is also an excellent product, made by the same company. I will add that I prefer the spray bottles to the wipes for both. I do a lot of brake and suspension work on my track car, and "Copper" Anti-seize is highly recommended as they have higher tolerant of heat than regular anti-seize. This 8oz. bottle will last you a life time if you only occasionally DIY on your vehicle.  For the price, this deal can't be beat.... Tried it today, and I must say I can readily feel some difference. The transmission feels very responsive, smoother and quicker (not a huge difference, but I'll take anything reasonable). I also have been monitoring the temperature. There does seem to be a MINOR fluctuating difference since my usage. It now is reduced by 1-2 degrees - NO more than that though. I will be adding a tranny cooler to do that shortly. At this point in time the smoother shifting is more important.Do not expect a miracle, there are no miracles in bottles ! Will keep monitoring it and provide update to viewers.Would I buy it again ?  - YES ! I gave it 4 stars, but will change it as soon as I see the overall long-term difference (thats the part that really counts).Update as of Dec 25, 2012: Did a tranny fluid change and I got an even better performance out of my civic using more lubegard this time around. Also, dumped the Lucas product out of the tranny. Lucas does NOT, and cannot compare to lubegard's superior performance. The tranny is even more responsive now 
one way check valve. Not a real big deal.Comes with 2 hoses and clamp as pictured. I think it even comes with a sticker. Well, this is a filter... not very flashy but comes with a nice cap unlike my local parts store that wanted $1 more and did not include the cap. it looks well build. This shield is identical to the one that came with your helmet.  It ships in a simple plastic package not suitable for storing when not in use, I recommend a storage bag for your spare shields when not in use so they do not get dinged up when in storage or saddlebags. 
I wanted a strainer that would fit in the smaller of the two sinks in my TT.  The smaller being only 8" x 13".  The lips of this hang on the sides of the sink but that works well.  The cover becomes a tray for drainage if you perfer to use it on a counter top.  The lid snaps firmly shut allowing for storage of items inside for travel.  Not perfect, but all in all it works well. Works great for smaller seals but it couldn't pull out the rear main seal for a 2002-2006 MINI Cooper. These are very large seals. The tool just couldn't provide enough leverage for that. I used a flat blade screwdriver instead. Perfect tool for small and medium size seals. Use this for oil changes on my Subaru BRZ and it works great. Just stick the extension that has a smaller tube size right into the dip stick tube. 
These item does fit perfect on my 2004 BMW x3. does what its suppose to do. so far so good thanks Unlike most cabin air filters, the Fresh Breeze is impregnated with carbon and baking soda to reduce odors. It is hard to tell how much difference it makes, but the price is lower than for competing name brands. Physically the filter seems to be well constructed. I don't have a fancy laboratory to do any in-depth testing, but what mortal does?Amazon's application fitment guide for this part is messed up. I know for a fact this size fits a 2003 Honda Accord and a 2006 Acura TSX, even though Amazon says it doesn't. Check the fram.com website to get the correct number for your vehicle. Ultra grey seal makes a good gasket. This one works good especially for imports like Honda, Nissan, Toyota and many more. Have used it for water pumps and does not leak. Good stuff!

It took numerous squeezes of the sprayer to get adequate coverage. The product itself was excellent. 32mm is the correct size for my Jetta TDI oil cap, and this fits perfectly.It's also fairly low profile, another plus. 
There is an acceptable itsy bitsy leak left. You can watch &#34;Fixing Oil Seal Leaks Fast&#34; video on YouTube by scottykilmer. You need 8 ounces for car engine or transmission usage, and 3 ounces for power steering. I am going to order more for power steering and transmission usage. Pros:Generous supply in 32 oz bottleWorks in fuel or mixed with engine oilSmells pleasant (minty, clean)Keeps cold engine start-ups slick and quickCons:Thin lubricantThins out your oilIt is a solvent, it MIGHT (no facts to support that possibility yet) deteriorateyour gaskets, seals.Claims:Cleans out engine, plugs, valves, and injectorsMY recommended use:8 - 10 oz per oil change(they recommend 20% mmo with engine oil change. That's about a quart)4 - 6 oz per 12 gallon fuel tankAt first use, keep engine idle for 30 mins for complete mixup and soak in.Then you drive for 1 hour, then you can switch engine off. Fairly easy to install.  It took me about an hour.  It does what it is advertised to do.  Keeps 30 pounds of pressure in the water system so that the pump cycles less.  Tried it out today after de-winterized my TT.  Works. 
Great wheel lock that is easy to activate and unlock.  It comes with 3 keys, one of which has a LED light on it.  The product also comes with a reminder cord that attaches to the handle bar as a reminder.  It does just what I was looking for. Does what it says it does......looks great ! Well built with a weatherproof cover; comes with two keys and will protect your hitch or what ever you need to protect.

It filters oil and comes with the gasket and crush washer you need to change the oil This is one the best oil filters on the market for the Harley-Davidson Motorcycles. I use these filters on my 2007 Harley-Davidson Fatboy Motorcycle because they do a great job in filtering my oil. The oil filter on my Harley is mounted on the front of the engine. This location plus the fact the crank position sensor is in the way of using most oil filter wrenches, you have to buy a special wrench, which will slip in use, to remove the oil filter . This oil filter has a 17mm nut welded on end of the filter housing, this makes installing or removing the oil filter very easy. You don't have to worry about damaging your Engine Crank Position Sensor which are expensive to replace. I highly recommend this great K&N Performance Oil Filter for any Harley-Davidson Motorcycle owner who uses regular or synthetic motor oil. Great price and it's chrome plated to boot.

fits my car perfectly, works perfectly, was easy to install. The best measure of a wiper blade is that it does what it is supposed to do, when it is supposed to do it. They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. This product does not fit your 2012 Toyota Tacoma! That's according to Amazon.YES, IT DOES FIT MY 2012 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab.I don't know what that white powder is on the rubber seal, but I cleaned it before installing the cap.  No error codes and no gas stolen so far. 
It fits perfectly to my 2005 Honda Accord.Filter quality seems to be good. bought this for my 2004 honda crv.  fit perfectly and cleared the code.  easy to do just give the threads some wd40 fits my car perfectly, works perfectly, was easy to install. The best measure of a wiper blade is that it does what it is supposed to do, when it is supposed to do it. 
Fits perfectly for my 2003 Toyota Camry, but the number of folds in the filter were fewer than the OEM one. It's short 10 folds compared to the Toyota OEM cabin air filter. Purolator PureOne filters are one of the highest regarded filters. This particular filter is no exception! It's been very versatile (used it on late model Honda Civic, Fit, CR-V, and Pilot as well as on my Goldwing) and filters just as good, if not better, than OEM filters. Highly recommended! I have a 2007 RAV 4 V6 and change my own oil. This tool fits the cannister perfectly and makes installing a new filter cartridge and "O" rings a snap. You just need a common 3/8" rachet driver to fit the hole. Worth every penny for this well made, accurate, quality product. If you have one of the 65 mm canister type filter housings, and change your own oil, you can't do better than this. Highly recommended. 
Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlander Bought this to use withValterra F02-4100 45 RV Hydroflushso I could wash out my tanks.Here is my review of that setuphttp://www.amazon.com/Valterra-F02-4100-45%C2%B0-RV-Hydroflush/product-reviews/B0002UHVAA/ref=cm_cr_dp_synop?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints;=0&sortBy;=bySubmissionDateDescending#R2CUAU2B8XC98QIt works great.I also like that I have this as an emergency backup if one of my valves ever fails. 
Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.  The pickle fork is the last resort for me, as it will damage the balljoint boot.I prefer to use the Snap On balljoint remover.  If that one cannot fit, then I will try this tool.  If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork. IT WORKS I haven't really used it yet for the reason intended, changing the oil in my jet ski.  So, I can't comment on how well it works.  The main reason for this review is to put it out there that it does not work with a 2000 Chevy Silverado.  The siphon tube does not fit thru the bottom of the dip stick tube.  It would be really nice if Mityvac had a published list of what vehicles it works with and what ones it does not.  I have my fingers crossed that it'll work with my jet ski, otherwise there will be a new/(un)used Mityvac on *****'slist.  Long story short, do your research to see if you can confirm or deny if it will work with your vehicle before you buy it. 
This makes it SO easy to charge in conjunction with my battery tender.  So far it has fit all my vehicles batteries ( Acura integra, Toyota Tundra, Toyota Pickup ) They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Bought this for work... do a lot of Toyota, scion, lexus oil filters... works good. nice tight fit and hasent stripped anything yet... 
Fits perfectly for my 2003 Toyota Camry, but the number of folds in the filter were fewer than the OEM one. It's short 10 folds compared to the Toyota OEM cabin air filter. This fit all four O2 sensors on my 2002 Toyota Tundra and I could have not completed the job without this specialized socket. This product does not fit your 2012 Toyota Tacoma!

This drain works good but is starting to corrode. It really should be made from stainless steel or even plastic. with plastic bumpers being the norm, thought I'd use this plastic polish.  It brings the shine to the plastic painted areas just like step 2 does to the metal. Truly an impressive assembly of 4 parts. If there is a finer example of a little piece of rubbery roll-y wheel attached to a wooden handle with some metal parts in the middle tying it all together, show me. 
This fit all four O2 sensors on my 2002 Toyota Tundra and I could have not completed the job without this specialized socket. They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Bought this to install with an aftermarket Kenwood Navigation 7120 on my 08 Toyota Tacoma.  It took several hours to install, but it works great with the wheel controls in my Toyota. 
Fits perfectly, easy to install.  Anyone - including those with zero mechanical ability, can change this filter easily.  Anyone who would pay the massive amount the Audi dealer wants to change this filter is a complete fool. Years ago I learned the hard way by not draining the fuel "OR" adding a gas stabilizer to all my yard equipment and motorcycles.  It was an expensive lesson.  I use it every year and have never had "any" problems.  It works, exactly how they say it does. I required an ammonia-free window cleaner for my tinted windows. This does the job quite nicely. It isn't how well it does, rather how safely it does it. 
cleans very well removes brake dust and stuck on grime..need to spray on and let soak scrub with brush..hose off..if stains are old or been on rims for awhile you will have to do a second clean but it will remove 95% of grime If you RV, you want one of these. We never use the fresh water tanks in our RV for drinking (we buy bottled water for that), but for washing dishes, bathing, and other purposes, we do. So having clean water is still important.While no inexpensive filter will provide 100% clean safe drinking water, at least these filters get rid of most of the gunk that might clog up your water system. This must be one of the best washer fluids for summer, Do Not use this in the wintertime, will freeze up and may crack the tank, cleans the windshield of all the bugs and sap perfectly 
Perfect for washing the RV...strong pole you can scrub as high as you need to go or can leverage. Holds its position when set.  Very pleased. Does exactly what it is supposed to and you can use it without having to run around the vehicle to turn the water on and off. Need one say more?  And, these can be locked in place using a small lock you put in the tightening head (lock not included).  Once in place between the wheels on a tandem axle trailer, there's no way the trailer will move.  Cool! 
Nobody else has mentioned it.  This is the K&N size for anyone who uses the Ford FL1A.  It also works in place of the Derale 13092. It's the second time, I've used this product on my Mitsubishi Eclipse v6 5sp. I highly recommend it for everyone to use it. I've been using Red Line Products for years. This transmission oil is the only one you can safely use in classic British sports cars. Highly recommended. 
I used this on a 1993 Lexus with 135,000 miles.It had problems shifting into over drive with a 4 speed auto transmission.In less than 100 miles after replacing 3 qt`s transmission fluid and 8 oz`s Lubeguard (1 oz.for every qt your transmission holds) it shifts smoothly once again. My oil pan is leaking(1-2 drops). Its just minor leak so I pour in about 6 ounce of AT205.Its been 2 months and I'm still seeing drop of oil in the parking lot.Plan to add full 8 ounce+ 2 ounce left over after next oil change.Cost $800-1000 labor for $30 oil pan gasket due to dropping subframe and holding engine from top(labor intensive).Its only 1-2 drops per day so I'll try everything before it get worse. I drive a 2010 VW Jetta 2.0TSI. This car has the oil filter on top of the engine which makes using an oil extractor for oils changes a very good idea. I dont know why some reviewers have had problems with this oil extractor. I used this as soon as it arrived and it worked perfect! I even did an oil change wearing a whit polo and khakis and did not get dirty at all! Here was my process:1. Drove car until it reached normal temp (not the 5 mintues suggested in instructions)2. Removed engine top cover.3. Remove dipstick4. Put oil extractor hose into dipstick tube until it stopped5. Pumped extractor until I got resistance on the pump handle6. About halfway through, I removed the oil filter and oil cap7. When I got nothing but air I filled it back up with Pentosin HPII 5W40 (highly recommend for VW)8. Replaced oil filter and dipstick9. Cleaned extractorThis whole process took no more than 20 minutes, including having to entertain my 3 year old son (he likes to help dad fix the car). This product works like a champ and makes oil changes much easier. 
Then you need Sta-Bil. Leaving gas sit around in cans or lawn equipment and it starts to break down. Sta-Bil prevents that from happening. Forget the rest. The others are only gimmicks compared to Chevron Techron. Techron absolutely works. It will remove the corn fuel tarnish from your engine and keep those injection needles clean. Yes, I said tarnish. Tarnish will build up in your engine, fuel lines and injectors if you are not using Techron. No, it doesn't matter if you have a 'flex fuel' automobile or not, this tarnish is akin to pancake syrup and will eventually ruin your engine. Below is the formula:1/3: to the manifold (using brake booster)1/3: to the fuel tank1/3: to the engineYour engine will be much cleaner. Remember: do it at night, otherwise, you will scare your neighbor with dark smoke. 
This air gauge is dead on accurate, it seals completely, allows air to flow the way it should and the two headed chuck fit all cars, trucks and even those pesky hard to reach motorcycle valve stems. I own three motorcycles and there is nothing more aggravating than trying to fit a chuck in between rotors, fork tubes and tight spaces on a motorcycle. You know what I mean. This two headed angled chuck is angled perfectly to fit over a cycle stem without leaking or having to bend the valve stem. I love it. It is a high capacity suction gun. I used it to suction power steering fluid for my bmw335i in just one shot.  The only cons is the vinyl hose is a bit large and the remaining tiny fluid in the reservior can not be suctioned thoroughly.  Other than that, all is fine. No leaking at all. Do not forget to clear the vinyl hose and inside of the gun after use so that you can keep it longer. Overall this is a pretty nice little unit.  It is compact, shipped in a compact box and the overall product quality is good. Product comes with an easily removable vacuum pump, solid plastic collection ball, collection tube of larger diameter tubing that connects to a smaller diameter tube that looks to be wire reinforced plastic covered tubing that easily should fit in most dipstick tubes. Tubes were long enough so I could sit the unit on the floor and have plenty of tube to insert down the dipstick tube.  Very easy to set up and use and the included red funnel makes it very easy and neat to pour the waste into a container for recycle.  The pump, funnel and the tube simply push onto the ball which has rubber type attachments.  I put a little oil on the o-ring under the top rubber piece to help improve the seal.  I bought this to change engine oil for a car that uses 7 liters of 5w-30 synthetic oil.  I ran the engine to heat up the oil some before I started the removal.  The system worked and got just about all of the oil out of the engine through the dipstick.  BUT, it took 4 hours to extract the oil.  The oil moves very slowly through the 1/8&#34; diameter or so tube that is inserted into the dipstick.  With the viscosity of the oil, the small diameter of the tubing and the limited amount of vacuum you can create - you can expect anywhere from 1/2 hour to 1 hour per quart. I tried this with some lighter viscosity fluids and it works really good.  This will be good for the snowblower, generator and other small oil volume units I have.  If you have time this is a nice item.  If you want it done quick this will not be your best option. 
The pump works like any other, and I had good luck with it. One thing to be aware of is that it only works on single quart bottles. Poured the whole bottle in a full tank of gas on my 2004 Tahoe 5.3L V8. I do a lot of stop and go driving which helps the cleaner work more effectively. Over the course of driving that tank of gas I noticed it did idle more roughly as the cleaning detergents were breaking up deposits. Now it idles smoothly and makes the vehicle seem like it has a little extra power and smoothness.After a tankful with SI-1 I also tried using Seafoam spray in the intake (the can comes with a spray adapter for the throttle body). Although I've used Seafoam in the past with great results, there was almost no smoke out of the exhaust this time around. I think the SI-1 worked so well that the Seafoam did not have anything else to clean out! Something to consider next time you plan to do some preventative maintenance on your vehicle. I replaced my old Flojet pump with a Revolution pump. While at it, I installed these hoses. One of my existing hoses was already the same type, but the other more rigid. I don't think these helped much, and it's more connections that need to be checked for leaks. 
The Tender Jr. does not come with a cigarette adapter so I cut this in half to make two. I purchased 2 lighter plugs for a buck each from China&#8230; with free shipping&#8230; and they are working fine. These aren&#8217;t an exact match with the Tender cables but they fit together OK and are easy to determine polarity with the wire colors. You can also just use this as an extension cord for your Tender. The description states a length of 12-inches&#8230; but it&#8217;s actually 14-inches tip-to-tip on the connectors. Nice item for the price and it&#8217;s made in Mexico. please note these are not white - but beige... other than that they are standard rv baggage catches these are a great additional tool for leveling the front and sides of the camper when you are by ourself! They are large enough to see from a distance to keep things on the level 
Can place inside the fill tube and walk away - didn't come shooting back out against the water pressure.  Only complaint is that it is a little long where the threaded portion connects with the hose.  Had to install another rubber gasket to get it to stop leaking. I read the instructions throughly and referred back as I was going through the process. The equipment is well made, and the key thing I learned after a lot of trial and error is that it would not work if I had the base unit too tight against the windshield. Part of the directions say that when you tighten down the tightening/driving screw that pushes the product into the crack, the rubber tip of the alignment device should "open".  If you have the bottom part too tight against the windshield, it won't "open" and thus your crack won't get filled with the liquid. Loosening the bottom allowed this to happen.I had a 1/2 inch crack starting in a line from a rock impact. The directions said to start with 4 - 6 drops, I did. After about 24 drops, the crack was filled. Keep cycling through drops, drive it in, remove the screw, more drops. The more you remove and replace the screw liquid driver, the more it drives it into the crack.My crack was very small, I thought, yet it took 24 drops of liquid to get the liquid flowing into the crack.By the time you master this artistic but very fruitful process, you'll be an expert and can offer tips to anyone! Seems a bit flimsy but works well .... I always hated leaving the hose in when it topped off and water spewed out I would need to run to the hose to turn it off while it was geyser of water flying out the side of my trailer .... I just wait till its full ... turn the shut-off valve off and I'm good to go wit no mess. Plus having a large valve at the end help with the hose not folding and crimping. For the price it does what it's suppose to do. 
I have a possible solution for the tight-coupler problem. I used to have a Caterpillar grease gun that had to be pried off the fitting just like this gun does. It was also a heavy duty, industrial gun like this Lincoln. I like heavy duty, but there is a limit to how much force needs to be applied to free the coupler from the grease fitting. Most do-it-yourselfers have a Dremel. Dremel makes a small, cone-shaped, red-stone bit. It's head is 5mm wide at the base and 8.5 long. I don't know the item number. It is tiny. Under a magnified florescent work lamp, I lightly ground the three crescent-shaped, spring-loaded clamps that grab the grease fitting, careful to maintain the original contour. This took about two minutes. I'd lightly graze all three clamps and then test the connection. I left the coupler a little tight allowing for future wear. This grease gun is top quality. After a two-minute modification, it is now a customized tool. Guys like to customized cars, motorcycles and guns, why not their tools? I needed a tough pistol-grip grease gun to access tight places where it is nearly impossible to operate a lever-action gun.  This works for me.  Good luck. The rubber protector is a nice to have addition but it's a bit of a pain to install. You have to unscrew the hose from the gauge (wrenches required) and it's a tight fit - some type of lubricant (e.g. a little diluted liquid soap) will help. I used teflon tape (the stuff used for plumbing fixtures) when reattaching the hose - works well and is better than whatever was used at the factory. Must have if you own one a Toyota that uses 64mm oil filters.This is the tool that will fit, many other socket wrenches on the market is either 64.5mm or 65mm, some may workBut more often then not, they slips and cant loosen nor tighten the filters enough.Cat in one piece aluminum, not assembled by spot welding pressed sheet metal. So it will do the job and wont break apart.Definite professional grade. 
a regular 32mm socket will not fit in the space of my equinox. this is a kind of shorter 32mm socket designed only for oil filter cap job. it works fine. This is designed to work with the Valterra bayonet fitting on your Gray or Black water dump valve and it does just that... Works as needed, only problem is it will only fit a standard oil jug not the gallon.

I used teflon tape (the stuff used for plumbing fixtures) when reattaching the hose - works well and is better than whatever was used at the factory. This is one good grease gun.  Yeah, it's easily twice to three times what you'd spend in a big box store for a grease gun but it's solid and heavy-weight.  It probably weighs twice the weight of the gun it replaces.  It's got an air pressure release valve to purge any trapped air.  The rubber hose is longer than most and that helps getting in those hard-to-reach places.  The tip snaps securely on the zerk fitting and the hose end fitting is adjustable to get a secure connection on the zerk valve.  And the one-handed operation of the squeeze handle is a delight to use.  I just finished using it to grease the spindles and wheels of my riding mower and it worked great.This has got to be the last grease gun you'll ever buy.  You'll thank yourself every time you use it. This item is primarily used for REMOVAL, not installation of an oil filter that has been tightened too much to remove by hand. The half-circles of metal grip the canister of the oil filter and they dig into that sheet metal to prevent slipping when you apply pressure to your wrench handle and start to turn. The tool may need to dig in enough to dent the oil filter canister depending on the degree of excessive tightening by a previous installer. Each half circle on the tool is brought to initial grip and held there by a set of springs on a sliding mount to accommodate a variety of filter canister sizes.  I used it to remove the original factory oil filter for the first oil change on a new vehicle. I probably won't have to use it ever again. In 40 years of DIY oil changes across a couple dozen different cars, I've never had a leak by simply hand-tightening the canister to the mount. 
Nice product, claims not to damage pressure senders, seems to be effective if puncture is in the tread.  Does not claim to work on sidewalls. My unit did not come with any instructions.  The tool seems too complicated to be very useful, but does work. does the job. 
IT WORKS Nice product, claims not to damage pressure senders, seems to be effective if puncture is in the tread.  Does not claim to work on sidewalls.

If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork. 
fits my car perfectly, works perfectly, was easy to install. The best measure of a wiper blade is that it does what it is supposed to do, when it is supposed to do it. This does not fit my wheels. It needs a hose to fit more stem configurations. The 100 is identical, except for the 0-60 it is 0-100, but states it has a 11" hose but it doesn't. I recommend a type with a hose for versatility. The 100 is nice but the 60 is fine for most applications. If you have a bike that needs over 60 than look for a 100. This is not for all applications. Also be careful not to drop this or you throw it away. Does what it supposed to do,Fits most of my scooters.Does not fit a Honda Shadow 750's disc brake, because the disc is too wide.One star less, because the mechanism to mount the pouch to the handlebars is very weak, and impractical (I can't install it on handlebars of scooters because they have the handlebars covered with plastic, and can't install it on the handlebars of my motorcycle, because the hand grips and throttle are too wide, so it does not fit; the pouch also does not have a locking mechanism, so it's kind of moot to try to mount it somewhere).Otherwise, a great purchase! 
Don't waste your money on Fram filters. Mann filters will not fail you if you plan on a long oil interval in excess of 5k miles.Fit my E39 528i perfectly. It also came with the correct o-ring to seal the oil filter housing. Just buy it already! Fits perfectly for my 2003 Toyota Camry, but the number of folds in the filter were fewer than the OEM one. It's short 10 folds compared to the Toyota OEM cabin air filter. This is one the best oil filters on the market for the Harley-Davidson Motorcycles. I use these filters on my 2007 Harley-Davidson Fatboy Motorcycle because they do a great job in filtering my oil. The oil filter on my Harley is mounted on the front of the engine. This location plus the fact the crank position sensor is in the way of using most oil filter wrenches, you have to buy a special wrench, which will slip in use, to remove the oil filter . This oil filter has a 17mm nut welded on end of the filter housing, this makes installing or removing the oil filter very easy. You don't have to worry about damaging your Engine Crank Position Sensor which are expensive to replace. I highly recommend this great K&N Performance Oil Filter for any Harley-Davidson Motorcycle owner who uses regular or synthetic motor oil. Great price and it's chrome plated to boot. 
I must have misunderstood how this siphon works. I have never been able to get it work at all. I have tried every possible method  and no luck. I understand how gravity works but apparently this device doesn't. If you get it to work, more power to you. I haven't really used it yet for the reason intended, changing the oil in my jet ski.  So, I can't comment on how well it works.  The main reason for this review is to put it out there that it does not work with a 2000 Chevy Silverado.  The siphon tube does not fit thru the bottom of the dip stick tube.  It would be really nice if Mityvac had a published list of what vehicles it works with and what ones it does not.  I have my fingers crossed that it'll work with my jet ski, otherwise there will be a new/(un)used Mityvac on *****'slist.  Long story short, do your research to see if you can confirm or deny if it will work with your vehicle before you buy it. works fine.  fuse is a 7.5v if that helps anyone.  i have 3 of these and they all work great. 
This is one the best oil filters on the market for the Harley-Davidson Motorcycles. I use these filters on my 2007 Harley-Davidson Fatboy Motorcycle because they do a great job in filtering my oil. The oil filter on my Harley is mounted on the front of the engine. This location plus the fact the crank position sensor is in the way of using most oil filter wrenches, you have to buy a special wrench, which will slip in use, to remove the oil filter . This oil filter has a 17mm nut welded on end of the filter housing, this makes installing or removing the oil filter very easy. You don't have to worry about damaging your Engine Crank Position Sensor which are expensive to replace. I highly recommend this great K&N Performance Oil Filter for any Harley-Davidson Motorcycle owner who uses regular or synthetic motor oil. Great price and it's chrome plated to boot. Don't waste your money on Fram filters. Mann filters will not fail you if you plan on a long oil interval in excess of 5k miles.Fit my E39 528i perfectly. It also came with the correct o-ring to seal the oil filter housing. Just buy it already! The K&N; Performance Gold oil filter is the best for racing because:1.- The 1" nut welded to the end makes removal quick and easy.2.- Drilled safety wire holes for racing.3.- Metal leaf spring provides a positive, leak-proof seal between element and lid.4.- Thicker walls and end plate gives over 550 psi bursting strength.5.- Resin-impregnated filter media provides maximum filtering surface for contaminant removal.6.- Steel inner core provides extra structural support to prevent filter collapse.7.- Bearing-Saver Anti-Drainback Valve eliminates "dry" starts.8.- Rolled threads provide protection against stripping.9.- Leak-proof double rolled seam.10.- Internally lubricated gasket allows easy installation and removal.11.- Unaffected by racing fuels, MTBE, and E-85.12.- Low pressure drop - flows 12-16 gallons per minute.NO OTHER automotive oil filter meets these specs -- BUT -- like all other things that seem too good to be true, the K&N; Performance Gold has 2 MAJOR drawbacks:1. The same 10-20 micron filtering ability that allows those super-high flow rates also means that the oil filter is only 90% (K&N;'s numbers)efficient.2. That 90% efficiency also means that the filter allows larger dirt particles to remain in the oil, and you're stretching your luck by running the K&N; oil filters for more than 3,000 miles. That super-duper synthetic juice isn't any good when it's full of dirt, so the advantages of long-life synthetic oils are lost on the K&N;'s high flow-rate capacity.Once again, we're looking at a trade-off --If you NEED the K&N;'s RACING advantages more than you NEED the 5,000-mile filter-change intervals, then the K&N; is PERFECT for you.If you NEED to use synthetic oils and go for the longer (5,000+) change intervals, I suggest a different brand of oil filter.The BOSCH Premium Oil Filter #3410 that crosses to the K&N; #HP2010 is also made in the USA. It doesn't have the hi-flow features of a K&N;, but the BOSCH "FILTECH" filtration media advertises a 98% efficiency, and can go for 5,000 miles with API "SN", ILSAC 5, "Dexos1" - approved full synthetic oil (5W30 Pennzoil Platinum). Remember that a high-efficiency filter will CLOG SOONER, so pushing your oil filter for more than 5,000 miles is neither prudent nor thrifty. Actually, stupid is what it is !! You CANNOT repair the damage done by a clogged oil filter by replacing the filter !!For EXTENDED oil-and-filter change intervals, Mobil 1 offers an "Extended Life" oil filter that's made just for "Extended Service" synthetic oils -- but is NOT available (due to size restrictions) for all vehicles. There IS a Mobil 1 Extended Life Oil Filter available that crosses with the K&N; #HP2010, the Bosch #3410, and the Motorcraft 820S. The Mobil Extended-Life Filter is #M-210Non-racing applications of today's modern gasoline engine specifications can best be met with the use of full synthetic oils that meet the latest API "SN", ILSAC 5, and Dexo1 specs. The API "SN" designation allows for use in ALL gasoline engines, including supercharged and turbocharged gasoline engines from ALL manufacturers.If you're wondering just which is the best oil for YOUR particular vehicle, go to the Mobil-1 website and look for the "Best Oil For My Car" tab. Answer a few questions about your engine, and they'll give you the correct VISCOSITY specifications according to their manufacturers' data-base.Use whatever BRAND of oil that you want -- it's the API-ILSAC Specifications and the PROPER VISCOSITY of the oil that matters most.The old myths of "thicker oil lubricates better" and "more detergent means less oil" are long gone -- the new synthetic formulations have made it easy for anyone to have the best lubrication available.Selecting the right lubes and filters for YOUR driving requirements is an important part of vehicle ownership.Good Luck !! 
Purolator PureOne filters are one of the highest regarded filters. This particular filter is no exception! It's been very versatile (used it on late model Honda Civic, Fit, CR-V, and Pilot as well as on my Goldwing) and filters just as good, if not better, than OEM filters. Highly recommended! Great alternative OEM filter for Lexus LS430's. I've used this filter without any issues. Fits perfect and does not leak. I use this exact filter on my 05 Honda Silver Wing. Honda recomends Torqing the filter. And the 17mm Nut makes it easy. Bought the bike used with about 2k miles. Rode 1500 miles and my oil is still clean. This is a Heavy filter for its size. Due to the steel case. 
What can I say the title says it all, it works as described.  The construction is good, but nothing to write home about.  3.5 stars if I had to give it an overall rating.  In all honesty not quite a 4 stars on this one. This works very good for washing my truck. I think it is a bit expensive but it works well. Blah blah blah longer review needed. Hey why can I not write the friggen length review I want. Once it gets wet, there isn't much you can do about wringing it out. It's title is true. I do not know why some give five stars to this product is very difficult to use it. might not have used it and lie so bad that confuse buyers because they believe that having five stars is a good product but it is not true .. I recommend the pva Chomu. I have one for seven years and works extremely well. 
Anybody who has worked on a engine knows that they need a oil filter wrench if they want to remove the oil filter off of the engine. I am sure we have all seen those standard oil filter wrenches where you slip them onto the oil filter and pull that lever which tightens it against the filter.Thats all well and great if your oil wrench is the proper sise for the filter you are trying to remove cause if its not, your out of luck there buddy. I have one of those big rig style oil wrenches and its too big to fit onto 2 inch oil filters and because of that lever, you can't get them up into tight spaces to work them.So I went looking for an oil filter wrench which would work great for small filters, hence, small engine work. Thats when I found the 3-Jaw universal wrench being sold at Amazon.com. I was a bit worried when I bought this because I saw how small it was in the Amazon image, thought it might not be strong enough.Oh how I was wrong, first thing I noticed when I took it out of the box was how heavy it was, deffinetly meant for the most tightest of filters. There was a guy at Amazon who said that he went to a hardware outlet to purchase a adaptor because he did not have a 1/2 drive rachet. Oh how I feel bad for him, he waisted his time, essentally he bought an adaptor to adapt from the adaptor.Hence it came with an adaptor and so if he just pulled the adaptor out, he would have noticed it has a built in 3/8 drive for rachets as well. Oops :(The jaw is fully adjustable from 2 and 1/2 inches all the way up to 4 inches so thats why its universal. All you have to do is put the jaws onto an oil filter, attach your rachet/socket wrench and begin loosening the filter.The only thing I don't like about this design is that you must keep holding it, if you let off pressure even for a second, the jaws will slip off the filter. Its not bad however once you get used to it and it works well. You tighten on the filter the same way, just switch your rachet direction switch.I would have liked to have seen rubber going down the 3 jaws as to protect the filter from getting scratched. If your not worried about cosmetics, then this won't matter to you. But if you have a race car for car shows, you may not want to scratch up your oil filter using this wrench which has no rubber on the jaws.However, this wrench design has a huge advantage over standard filter wrenches in that you hook onto it from the middle of the wrench. What this means is, you have a hard to reach oil filter in that Honda? No problem, stick on a few extensions, then your rachet, stick it up there and wala, instant access!All in all I think this is a great oil filter wrench. But it would have been nice to have a lock mechanism on the wrench to keep it from slipping off the filter if you let off pressure. And it would have been nice to have had rubber going up and down the jaws as to keep the filters from getting scratched.Date Purchased: 11/07-08Price Paid: $8.00Recommend: YES It fit my 2002 Ford Crown Vic Police Interceptor P71.Do this, it actually helped my car run smoother. You should have seen the jet black junk that came out of the "in" end of the filter when I dumped it out! How the filter was working, I don't know!I heard these filters are supposed to come with new hose clips, but neither of mine did on two separate orders.If you haven't done this before it can get messy with a pressurized fuel system (taking the gas cap off did little to relieve the pressure). Get a pan, rags, fire extinguisher, eye protection, and a hose to wash yourself off! It seems like the gas squirts out all over, and it does, but if you're quick enough, and wrap the hose in rags, you will have half a chance. NO OPEN FLAMES, SPARKS, HOT MUFFLERS, ETCETERA! DANGER!!! GAS, EXPLOSION, DEATH!There are clips on either end of the filter that LOOK like they come off, however, you can buy a little plastic set of "clip release" tools (Lisle 39400 Angled Disconnect Tool Set) that fit all of the clips on the car. You slide them into the hose and it spreads the clips for easy removal, and I reused mine again. I needed this in order to drain the waste tanks on our RV in case I wasn't able to do so on way home from a trip (or removing antifreeze from tanks in the Spring).  It twists on fine, makes a good seal to the drain fitting, and the hose outlet fitting does end up on the bottom so almost no liquid is left inside when draining is done. 
Had to have this product to do the oil changes on my wife's 2009 Toyota Camry 3.5L V-6. Great quality! I bought this to replace a lost fuel cap on my 2003 Toyota Noah.  It fits perfectly and actually seems to be of higher quality than the OEM fuel cap.  I believe this cap will work on all Toyotas but do your research to be sure. This filter works on the 2012 Toyota Rav4 Sport with the V6 engine.  It is so sad that car manufacturers are turning away from the spin-on oil filter.  They were so much better for the consumer, but maybe they want to force the less-mechanically inclined to have the car dealership perform maintenance? 
Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. 
How can one really rate it, as it is used for protection and no idae how long it should last, yet is was as listed so I give it the benifit ogf the doubt... I probably should compare it to another to see how accurate it is, but I really like how easy it is to use and turns off and on by itself. I don't know how many chock I have damaged so far due to the cheap quality. This one will not break even if I drive over it. Recommended a must for everyone. 
Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.  The pickle fork is the last resort for me, as it will damage the balljoint boot.I prefer to use the Snap On balljoint remover.  If that one cannot fit, then I will try this tool.  If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork. The tool appears to be of average quality.  However, I returned it to Amazon since it did not fit up to a Ford Taurus flex fuel engine.  This type of engine requires a special fitting that this tool does not have. The product works very well based upon condition of your interior. It will not make your car new, but it does work. Hope this helps.

Does exactly what it's supposed to do,fit low and snug on the filter cover. To work with good tools can make the task a miserable experience or a sense of accomplishment.Recommended for sure! Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. I haven't really used it yet for the reason intended, changing the oil in my jet ski.  So, I can't comment on how well it works.  The main reason for this review is to put it out there that it does not work with a 2000 Chevy Silverado.  The siphon tube does not fit thru the bottom of the dip stick tube.  It would be really nice if Mityvac had a published list of what vehicles it works with and what ones it does not.  I have my fingers crossed that it'll work with my jet ski, otherwise there will be a new/(un)used Mityvac on *****'slist.  Long story short, do your research to see if you can confirm or deny if it will work with your vehicle before you buy it. 
These are typical hard plastic handles, contoured for grip. The stock bar is substantial at 7/16". Edges are finished nicely. The metal shaft is unpolished and has a finish to prevent slippage.I don't care if all my hand tools are the same color, if it matters to you then note these may come in a different color than illustrate (see my pics).Made in the U.S.A. - nice.j it's sleek and easy to mount.  but note that the middle part sticks out and can get in your sight line.  if that bothers you, consider getting another blade. To stress what other reviewers have said, when you order this "2 Pack" you get what you see in the picture: two chocks, not two sets of chocks.This is a good light-duty set of chocks. They are lightweight, made of durable plastic, and are stackable (like they are in the picture) to save space. They are also bright orange so you don't forget about them when the job is done.The bottom of the chock is slightly serrated, which will give it a decent grip on concrete and asphalt - just make sure you wedge them in well. I would not use these chocks on an incline, on a soft or uneven surface or on a vehicle with a bad parking brake, but for all your normal uses these should do the trick.The two chocks come attached with a plastic fastener. It's a boar to remove, so a pair of pliers is recommended. If you look closely at the picture, you can see holes pre-molded into the lower end of the chock. If you want to keep the two connected but still easily separated for use, I recommend a short length of twine.

If you've ever had to change the oil in your Subaru, you know just how difficult the filter can be to remove with the exhaust manifold in the way. With this handy tool you just attach it to a 3/8&#34; extension and ratchet and you can say goodbye to burnt knuckles for good.The technicians here at the Subaru dealership I work at turned me on to these when I saw how easy they remove filters all day. I'm certain that this would work on a variety of other filter sizes as it expands to fit. Well worth the cash if you ask me. 
If you decide to replace the spark plugs, as I did in my '01 Suburban, the old wires will be very difficult to remove. The Suburban is 12 years old and the the spark plug wires appeared to be the original. The coil ends were easy to remove. The ends on the spark plugs were not, and i damage a couple of the wires trying different techniques of removal. The vehicle had 160k miles and they needed to be upgraded with OEM quality. These are the right wires and the vehicle runs so much better with the spark plug tune up. I took the advice of Vino owners here and on the Yahoo Vino group and ordered one for my scooter. Couldn't be happier. Changing the plug on this scooter is a bit of a pain (it's pretty cramped in there) but the results were worth it. A few tips for to Vino 125 owners: Set aside more time than you think you'll need to replace the plug. Get a plug wrench with a foam insert that hold the plug, or you may end up wasting a lot of time fishing the plug out after you lose it in the plastic housing that surrounds that part of the engine. And have a claw type "pickup tool" handy for when you do drop the plug into the housing. ;-) in my 08 tahoe, i changed plug and wires recently, i used Tune up Grease both inside of the wire boots and on the porcelain section of the plugs.I installed a set of iridium plugs and a set of ferrite wires in my 08 tahoe, the wires came with a tiny packet of tune up grease but this never seems like enough to me (not that i apply a lot, keep it simple.)the &#34;average&#34; fuel economy on the dash instant read computed had been stalled at 13.9 MPG for a very long time, this is a composite of in town and highway driving. I changed the plugs and wires with the help of this tune up grease and reset the average MPG, within 10 days my average is up to 14.8.I did NOTHING to the vehicle other than install wires and the plugs.This grease helps ensure a good, insulated connection and is a must for a little job like this which can make a difference in your mileage.this is a big tube and will last you a lifetime. 
I used this to change the plugs in my F-150. You can get away with a extension and socket but this is the right size to not be to long or two short. Great spark plugs, the exact type my motorcycle required.  Very good quality plugs, gap already set appropriately.  They all come cylindrical cardboard tube over electrode to protect plugs while in the box.  So you have no worries of your box being dropped and cracking your porcelain around the electrode.Very clean, crisp threads and installed in motorcycle heads with ease.INSERT tip:  using a 3/8" rubber hose approximately 6-8" long, slide it over the top end of plug and use to insert plug into place.  If you begin to cross thread during insertion the rubber hose will slip around plug.  Whereas, with a ratchet one might be apt to keep tightening at this point, thus ruining the female threads in your cylinder head.ChrisEastern NC Worked really well with the HTS 20' heavy duty hose. The combination extended the length of our Camco 15' to 35' which makes it much easier to reach a sewer outlet. You don't have to park on top of the dump spot! 
Removing spark plugs from the Ford Modular V8's can be exceedingly frustrating; especially if you snap a plug in half while trying to remove it. The diameter of this tool steadies your approach down into the depths of the head and prevents you from leaning your tool sideways; thereby making in easier to remove the plug in one piece. Can place inside the fill tube and walk away - didn't come shooting back out against the water pressure.  Only complaint is that it is a little long where the threaded portion connects with the hose.  Had to install another rubber gasket to get it to stop leaking.

used it on my 1994 f150 2wd for the rear end cover. Sealed it without any issues! Did not seem to work well when i tried to use it on the plastic center cap though I have two cars, both of which require the large #14 sheet metal self-tapping screws to mount the plate to the nylon retainers behind the plate (the ones mounted on the car that the screws screw into). Problem is that diameter of the plastic ring that holds the screw covers is too small to take the screw's large diameter head. The maximum screw head diameter that will fit the ring is .435 inch (11 millimeters). Option 1: Replace the nylon retainers on the car, but different cars have different retainers so one must search for new ones that will accept a #12 screw. Option 2: Try to find #14 self-tapping screws with smaller heads. I shopped around for #14 screws with smaller heads to no avail. Option 3: Grind down the screw head's diameter. Option 4 (not good): On one car I used #12 sheet metal screws that have a smaller diameter, but DO fit the rings, and wrapped the threads with tape. This sort of works, but I really can't tighten them down satisfactorily. So I have to check their security now and then. I'm leaving the other car as is for now. Maybe someone has more practical ideas? Sure would like to hear of them. BTW, SEE THE UPDATE BELOW.UPDATE 11/16/13:I think I've found a viable solution to the above problem. I used a #12 sheet metal self-tapping screw, placed a 1/2-inch long piece of ordinary shrink tubing (1/4" i.d.) over the threads towards the pointed end of the screw. Used a heat gun (or you can use a match, BIC lighter or soldering iron) to shrink the tubing which effectively increases the thread diameter to about that of a #14 screw. This allows me to tighten the screw securely and will last much longer than ordinary tape. One more thing: The THICKNESS of the screw head doesn't quite allow the chrome cap to fully snap into place over the nylon ring. The top of the head needs to be filed down a little leaving enough Philips "X" to use the screwdriver. The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around! 
Our new 5th wheel came with the cable pull valves.  They stink!  This way at least I can make sure the tank is empty before I pull off the sewer hose.  Easy to put on.  I especially like the way you can rotate it to whatever direction you need it to be. I got my rv level and checked it using bubble levelers in several locations. Once it was for sure completely level I put these on the front by my electric tounge jack where I can see them when I am leveling the trailer. one is positioned for the side to side level and one is positioned for the up and down front and back level.They work great. I cleaned the area really good with alcohol and used the adhesive backers they came with.You can drill holes and screw them on but I do not like drilling holes if I do not have to.They have been on there for some time now and if they start coming off I will just get some 3m command strips or just get new ones since they are not that expensive. These work well for a budget level. They have double sided tape on the back and a couple of drill holes for security. The problem is that if you only use the tape they can move simply by grabbing them and wiggling them around. The onyl way to truly secure them is to drill holes. I did not want to drill holes in my RV in the event that I didn't like these or wanted to go with something else in the future.If you do get them I would buy a couple packs of them so that if they break or go bad you can put a new one in without chancing them being unavilable and potentially having to get something else that doesn't have the same screw hole pattern. 
Works great for lubricating spark plug and coil boots to allow them to easily slide on and off without damaging the spark plug wire. Just use a little bit in the end of the boot. It will not impeded the flow of current to the spark plug or coil. I have been using this for years on every type of ignition system including lawn mowers and race engines. Very well made unit, fits my Ford F150 and my Ram 2500 , Grease the snot out of it inside and out and install. The cover is a bit cheap but seems to work well. Double Double Check that you have the locking end on correctly, Just play with it before use and you will master it. When you use this fogging oil first spray into directly into intake (take off filter if necessary)with the engine running, this help keeps the intake and carburetor clean. then after 10 seconds shutdown engine then take spark plugs out then use attachment and spray (for 3 seconds) into each cylinder via sparkplug hole. you can then optionally pull the cord slowly or run the engine with disconnected spark plugs if you have electric start, this allows the engine to cycle the fogging oil on the piston and cyclinder. You can even run the engine briefly like for 2 seconds and the engine will throw out thick plumes of white smoke if you are looking to see the fog.using the fogging oil through the intake is not enough to PROPERLY fog your engine.

However, it does have a small hole in a plastic tab sticking out of the side of the rim which is perfect for threading a small hook or wire through and attaching it to the underside of the hood. All the benefits of a regular funnel with added flexibility and length - perfect. 
After owning this set  for 3 years i really appreciate the quality for the price. This set can be used to pull pins, bushings, bearings, hubs dents, and more. Minus the special threaded adapters, the set comes complete with hub attachments, 2 or 3 jaw pullers, threaded screw adapter, and more. This is a comprehensive set that the novice or the professional can be proud of owning,i know i am!!!!!! I bought these horns to replace the weak sounding horn that Toyota puts in the Corolla, Matrix, Prius, Yaris, ect.. These horns are very load to say the least. The Hella box included one low tone horn and one high tone horn. It also included instructions and a single Bosch style relay.There is NO wiring of any kind included with this purchase (this is why I gave it a 4 star). I made my own wiring harness which included a 30 amp fusible link, and the included relay and a relay socket. The following link is to the picture of my install on my 2006 Toyota Matrix XR:[...]Make sure you use the included relay in your install. I know some people have just used the existing single horn wire (not using relay), but these new horns have a pretty heavy amp draw! The last thing you want to do is mess up your factory wiring because of some horns. Do it the right way, and follow the instructions! Your horns will also sound better.You can not beat the price and sound quality of these horns! They will get your attention, I can promise you that.  I do recommend these horns! Bottle came as described, have not had to use it, but it comes with the TPMS safe sealant in most flat kits. 
This seems to be one of the better levelers. There are two different scales on these levels. One is for the side-to-side (back of the coach) and the other is for the front-to-back (side of the coach). The reason there are different scales are they are more-or-less calibrated in inches.For example, it is simple Trigonometry to determine how many inches the coach is out of level simply by using the formula for right-angles and solve for one side. The input values are the angle (determined by the level) and distance from the level to the point at where you want to know how many inches of lift are needed.For the side-to-side level, the 1&#34; markings are pretty accurate as long as you put the scale in the center of the coach, as most coaches are within an inch or two of width from another.  However, for the front-to-back level, even though you put the scale in the center, the result will vary wildly due to the length of the coach. Using this level on a 18ft coach will result in a far different measurement than say a 35ft coach.Also, if you don't put the level in the center (in the side or back), then the two ends of the coach will be different. For example, if the level is in the center, then when the level measures 1&#34; off level, that means 1&#34; on either front or back. But if you put the level off-center, then the level reading 1&#34; might truly be 1/2&#34; on one end, and 1 1/2&#34; on the other. Again, it is simply a principle of Right Angles in Trigonometry.Also, do not rely on the self-adhesive backing as over time it can move. As hard as it may be for you to do, drilling a couple holes and inserting screws into the levels is the best bet. I have two cars, both of which require the large #14 sheet metal self-tapping screws to mount the plate to the nylon retainers behind the plate (the ones mounted on the car that the screws screw into). Problem is that diameter of the plastic ring that holds the screw covers is too small to take the screw's large diameter head. The maximum screw head diameter that will fit the ring is .435 inch (11 millimeters). Option 1: Replace the nylon retainers on the car, but different cars have different retainers so one must search for new ones that will accept a #12 screw. Option 2: Try to find #14 self-tapping screws with smaller heads. I shopped around for #14 screws with smaller heads to no avail. Option 3: Grind down the screw head's diameter. Option 4 (not good): On one car I used #12 sheet metal screws that have a smaller diameter, but DO fit the rings, and wrapped the threads with tape. This sort of works, but I really can't tighten them down satisfactorily. So I have to check their security now and then. I'm leaving the other car as is for now. Maybe someone has more practical ideas? Sure would like to hear of them. BTW, SEE THE UPDATE BELOW.UPDATE 11/16/13:I think I've found a viable solution to the above problem. I used a #12 sheet metal self-tapping screw, placed a 1/2-inch long piece of ordinary shrink tubing (1/4" i.d.) over the threads towards the pointed end of the screw. Used a heat gun (or you can use a match, BIC lighter or soldering iron) to shrink the tubing which effectively increases the thread diameter to about that of a #14 screw. This allows me to tighten the screw securely and will last much longer than ordinary tape. One more thing: The THICKNESS of the screw head doesn't quite allow the chrome cap to fully snap into place over the nylon ring. The top of the head needs to be filed down a little leaving enough Philips "X" to use the screwdriver. This is everything you need in a tread depth gauge, and nothing you don't. Here's how you use it: You press the &#34;probe&#34; down into the tread gap to measure the depth. You then rotate the cylinder around to match the exact mark to the line. The measurements are on four sides of the cylinder, making them easier to read than being stacked on top of one another. Being able to rotate the cylinder makes it much easier to measure something as minute as 1/32 of an inch. 
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. Exact replacement from OEM. Exact fit worked perfect . Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs. 
Could a wheel chock chock is a wheel chock could chock wheels?In this case: 2.Good build quality, worked well on my AG tires on the rear of the tractor. The tires say 300 pound capacity and maybe that is what the rubber could support on a static load but these seem to be medium duty wheels. I purchased these wheels to replace the plastic wheels on a 5 HP chipper/shredder that weighs about 100 pounds and I tow behind a lawn tractor. For my application these wheels work well. The bearings are exposed and it seems that dust, dirt and water can get into the races. The metal wheel parts seem to be thin and I do notice that both have a slight wobble in them. For medium duty applications like my chipper it is ok. I would also use these wheels on my garden wagon and 5K watt generator. I would not use these wheels on a ride on mower that had to support my weight. I would use these wheels on the front free floating deck of my ride on mower.  A grease zerk fitting would have been nice on these wheels. Pros:-Helps you get your wheels off.  Then you can fix your own brakes, paint your calipers, or swap wheels!-Has 4 wrench sizes, which work for both metric and SAE lug nuts.-14&#34; provides adequate leverage for easy removal and installation of lug nuts.-Inexpensive!Cons:-Doesn't remove lug nuts for you.-Doesn't put your lug nuts back for you.The only way to make this wrench better would be to make it much longer (20&#34; or something), or to include a mechanic to do all the work for you (expensive). 
Made in China poor quality item that does not befit the Robert Bosch brand at all.Not for winter for sure.The origin of the product should be stated at the product page.If I knew it were a MADE-IN-CHINA I would not have bought it. Considering this is made in China, it is a quality product, too bad all my locks are keyed to the some number One question i have now that i read the bottom of the filter box saying "Made in Mexico"We all know "Made in China" means it was made good but with bad materials, so results can be OK or horrible depending on what it is, but how about filters ?Doing research i found that mexico's advantage could be the shipping price, but not much talk about quality of the assembly or material quality. 
Great spark plugs, the exact type my motorcycle required.  Very good quality plugs, gap already set appropriately.  They all come cylindrical cardboard tube over electrode to protect plugs while in the box.  So you have no worries of your box being dropped and cracking your porcelain around the electrode.Very clean, crisp threads and installed in motorcycle heads with ease.INSERT tip:  using a 3/8" rubber hose approximately 6-8" long, slide it over the top end of plug and use to insert plug into place.  If you begin to cross thread during insertion the rubber hose will slip around plug.  Whereas, with a ratchet one might be apt to keep tightening at this point, thus ruining the female threads in your cylinder head.ChrisEastern NC My husband installed these on his 97 Cherokee in just 10 minutes.  Remove 2 bolts on top of each lift support and place a screwdriver under the spring clip on bottom and the ball joint connection on the lower end slips right on.Trunk now stays up and doesn't hit him in his head! Worth the time and money for sure.Be sure to support the trunk with a 2x4 or long broom handle before removing old lifts. Save the bolts because there are no bolts provided with the new lifts. I highly recommend these mirrors. I did a lot of looking and comparing before I bought these. I have a 2006 Toyota Tacoma and these things fit well and do a real nice job. They vibrate a little but not excessive. The little bit of vibration I see doesn't interfere with my view. I also do not extend them very far. The further out you go with them the more they will vibrate. Just extend to the minimum needed in order to be able to see.Before attaching to the vehicle I think it's a good idea to loosen the three screws holding the swivel in place on the bottom of the mirrors and work in a drop of oil. Then do not over tighten these screws. They don't have to be very tight to hold the mirror still and not over tightening allows easy adjustment later. If you find they move when you close the door you can tighten a little more but to start off, finger tight with the screwdriver is all you need. I also placed a couple drops of oil on the aluminum sliding bar and worked it in before attaching. Also, when you bolt the mirror onto the aluminum slide bar, grip the base (the part with the internal threads) with a vise-grip or something (not too tight to crush it), then make sure the lock nut is between the bolt and the bar on the bottom, and then screw the bolt into the base (and through the aluminum slide bar) nice and tight without letting the base turn. You'll notice there are &#34;teeth&#34; on the bottom of the base. These are supposed to sink into the bar as you tighten the bolt. They keep the base from turning when you adjust the mirror. This is another good reason to not overtighten the three screws around the swivel. You want to be able to adjust the mirror from side to side and have it turn only at the swivel and without causing the base to turn against the aluminum slide bar.The bracket will bend the weather stripping on the outside of the window a little. It springs back when the mirror is removed but some of it will be permanent. It's not a big deal and you'll just have to deal with this if you want to use these mirrors. It is not a detriment to the operation of the window.I installed them as far forward as possible so that the top of the bracket was parallel to the ground and the new mirror sits right beside my existing one towards the outside. Tightening the ratchet by hand produced plenty of tension to hold it securely. Releasing the ratchet is another matter. It's too tight to just push it down with your finger. To release the tension I use a short piece of rope and loop it under the sliding buckle. Then I stand right next to the truck with the rope looped around one hand and my other hand on the ratchet release tab. I use my body leverage (knees and back) to pull upward on the rope a little which takes just enough pressure off the belt to allow me to press the ratchet release tab. You don't need to back the ratchet off very far - just enough to get the hook out from under the door. Then just close up the bracket and wrap up the belt around it and you're all pre-set for the next time.For better stability I advise when you're adjusting the belt, place the sliding buckle as necessary so that the crossbar forming the angle is not extended very far, if at all. And, yes, make sure there isn't any dirt behind the buckle or you'll get a scuff mark.You should have the windows all the way down when attaching to the vehicle. The bracket comes close to the window so you need to be careful not to let it scratch the window. After you get the mirror on I advise to raise the window very slowly to make sure that the metal bracket is not contacting (scratching) the window as you raise it. Once you're under way - be sure not to lower the window if there is any sand or debris laying on the bracket right next to the window or a scratch may occur from this action also. I've taken these off and on several times now and we've travelled with them and I've been relatively careful and have never had one scratch my window.On my truck, the doors fit really well and I can tell the difference when the hook for the mirror strap is hooked under the door. The door fits just a tad more tightly than usual. It has to be closed just a slight bit harder to make the latch engage and when I open the door it pops out ever so slightly because of the extra tension produced by the hook being in there on the bottom. I don't see this as a problem. The mirrors are not on there all the time and, even if they were, I think the latch mechanism on the Toyota is stout enough to handle it without any long term problems developing. Just be aware that the hook will slightly change thge way the door latches.The instructions are good, too. Not the usual loosely translated Mandarin. I've tried to supplement here with my own experience.

It took a grand total of 5 minutes to install both of them, and half of that was spent looking for a screwdriver.If you are at all nervous about trying this, here is a overly detailed set of instructions.1. Open hood. Prop it open with something wooden so it doesn't fall on you.2. Identify the strut on the right side of the hood.3. Identify the small metal clip at both ends of the strut. If in doubt, look at the new ones. You are looking for a metal band, about 1/2 inch in width, with two small slots. On the vehicle, slide a small screwdriver blade into the clip's slots, and twist the screwdriver to pry the clip upward. You can remove it, or just loosen it enough that there is a good sized gap between the clip and the strut.4. Now pull the strut away from the hood/body. You may need to slide a screwdriver behind the strut arm to get a little bit of leverage. It is easier to start with the end attached to the hood.5. Remove both ends of the strut from the vehicle.6. Attach the new strut. Make sure the strut is aligned the same way as the old one-with the cylinder at the top of the strut. (Refer to the opposite strut). Just place the socket in the strut over the ball joint on the vehicle, and give it a little tap or squeeze with your hand. It should snap right on.7. Repeat on the other strut.Note- if it seems like the strut is too big, the hood is probably not open all the way. There is NO WAY you are strong enough to compress the strut by hand.I'd strongly recommend replacing them in pairs, otherwise you will get a twisting motion on your hood. Plus if one failed, the other one is close behind.That's it, you're done. I have a possible solution for the tight-coupler problem. I used to have a Caterpillar grease gun that had to be pried off the fitting just like this gun does. It was also a heavy duty, industrial gun like this Lincoln. I like heavy duty, but there is a limit to how much force needs to be applied to free the coupler from the grease fitting. Most do-it-yourselfers have a Dremel. Dremel makes a small, cone-shaped, red-stone bit. It's head is 5mm wide at the base and 8.5 long. I don't know the item number. It is tiny. Under a magnified florescent work lamp, I lightly ground the three crescent-shaped, spring-loaded clamps that grab the grease fitting, careful to maintain the original contour. This took about two minutes. I'd lightly graze all three clamps and then test the connection. I left the coupler a little tight allowing for future wear. This grease gun is top quality. After a two-minute modification, it is now a customized tool. Guys like to customized cars, motorcycles and guns, why not their tools? I needed a tough pistol-grip grease gun to access tight places where it is nearly impossible to operate a lever-action gun.  This works for me.  Good luck. 
I'm a little disappointed in Hi-Lift Jack. Top is 2 piece and welded in the middle. Should have been one piece. They supplied a bolt rather than some sort of quick release pin to attach it. A bolt with a hand tightened nut will vibrate loose during transport. The hook on the bottom could have been a little deeper to grab onto other items other than round bumpers more securely. All in all a good add-on for your Hi-lift jack but it could have been designed a little better. Great tool for clamping hard to reach radiator hose clamps.  Its multi-position locking mechanism will make sure to clamp and hold various sized clamps- unlike other pliers that can only hold in the fully close position. I have two cars, both of which require the large #14 sheet metal self-tapping screws to mount the plate to the nylon retainers behind the plate (the ones mounted on the car that the screws screw into).

This little gadget keeps my lift handle paired up nicely when mounted to my vehicle. It can get in the way when jacking, but it is easily solved by just pulling it up onto the d hook on the top. This holds my grease guns quite securely, but the angle of the handle you manipulate to get it to clamp and release the gun makes it awkward to use at times. Great tool for clamping hard to reach radiator hose clamps.  Its multi-position locking mechanism will make sure to clamp and hold various sized clamps- unlike other pliers that can only hold in the fully close position. 
I have many quality tools. I purchased this "Power Wrench" so I can put back the "name brand" breaker bars and sockets back into my tool cabinet. I chose this product bc it has both lug sizes that I needed to simplify tires changes between the factory wheels and aftermarket wheels as they use different size lugs. I do like the fact that the sockets are indeed 6 point and thin wall. But: I`m dissatisfied with the way the wrench locks into the extended range, the quality of the sockets and extension themselves beside the storage pouch that was included. In my order, the plastic package was cut in several locations, also cutting the cheaply made storage pouch. IMHO The storage pouch won`t last long at all.Now that I have the Power Wrench, I`m just going to keep this and chalk it up to lifes experience. If anyone is looking for a breaker bar and socket to simplfy their tire change, simply look elsewhere. I`m sure for the money spent you could pick up a cheap set up for less. I gave this a 3 star rating bc it is adequate and will do the job as intended, hopefully. Also IMHO if you are looking to give this as a gift, simply "PASS" and give your Gearhead loved ones a gift card to their favorite tool place. After using a star lug wrench for many years, I decided to try the Gorilla telescoping power wrench and I am impressed by the additional power that this wrench seems to have.  There is absolutely more torque with this wrench and I am able to remove lug nuts with less effort than the star wrench that I have used for years.The Gorilla wrench can expand to provide additional leverage needed to remove even the most difficult lug nuts attached to your wheels. The telescoping feature snaps into place and I found that in order to reduce it back to it's normal storing size you must depress the recessed spring button and slightly turn the wrench.  You then just simply push the wrench against a hard surface such as the ground in order to collapse the wrench back to it's compact size. Two additional sockets are included as well as a protective plastic case to store your wrench.  The Gorilla wrench is heavy and is of sound construction and I am very pleased with this purchase. This hitch extension is &#34;adjustable&#34; because it has two holes on the &#34;male&#34; end of the receiver, and two holes on the &#34;female&#34; end.  Depending on how you insert this extension into your vehicle (hole one or two), and how you insert your bike rack or whatever else into the &#34;female&#34; end (hole one or two), there is some adjustment on how much extension you achieve.  In theory.I was hoping to use the SMALLEST amount of extension with this so that I'd achieve about 7&#34; of extension.  I needed to extend my Thule T2 bike rack just enough to clear a larger-than-factory Jeep tire.i am able to use the hole that positions this extension furthest into my Jeep (so the &#34;male&#34; of this extension is adjustable).  Unfortunately, I was not able to utilize the deepest hole in the &#34;female&#34; end of this extension because there is only about 2&#34; of space between that deeper hole and an internal ridge where the inside square bar is welded to the outside square bar.  Hard to describe, but essentially my Thule bike rack it the back of this extension before the holes lined up with the deepest hole in this extension.So.. I suppose you could blame that on my bike rack?  In hind sight though, I wouldn't trust any bike rack that only had that little amount of metal behind the holes--just not enough there to handle the load.  No.. I think that this extension could have been better designed to just have ONE hole on the &#34;female&#34; end, but position it somewhat in-between the two that it currently has.  I doubt that there are many racks out there that could utilize the deepest hole in this extension's &#34;female&#34; side...One additional comment.. I read some reviews that criticized the welds.  I am not a welder, but in my observation, the welds seem smooth and uniform all the way around this.  I must say that the metal is a little thin compared to other extensions that I've seen.  I think it's quite fine for any 2-bike rack out there, and I'm using it for that.  When I set up to carry 4-bikes, I do worry that this may snap though, and I am pursuing another extension for that reason.Conclusion:  If you are only carrying 2 bikes, and you are happy with the extension possibilities IGNORING the deepest hole in the &#34;female&#34; part of this extension, I recommend it.  The price is reasonable and the integrated locking bolt is really nice (especially if you buy their optional locking bolt.)If you want a very short extension, this probably won't work.If you plan to carry 4 bikes, I don't know if this is strong enough.  I'm using it for that occasionally, but I'm a little worried about it... 
First, you will need to buy the high tone also, or it will sound stupid. It is part #72102. I have put these pair on my last 4 cars. The low tone does have a habit of failing if it gets wet. This has happened twice to me. For some reason, the high tone works fine if it gets wet. Make sure you mount the low tone in a location where it will not get wet.The kit does not include a relay. You may want to install a relay, especially if your car is wired for one horn. The horns draw 4.5A each at 12V. This is usually within factory limits and most fuseboxes will have a 10A or larger relay built in the horn circuit. The kit does include 3 female blade connectors, a mounting bracket and nut, and a jumper wire (needed if your car is wired with one horn lead).And, they are very loud. Packaging declares 130db at 4 inches. I do not have a db meter, but I can assure you the horns will get the job done. The pair has a nice tone, and will rid your car of the little factory &#34;meep meep&#34; horns. Works great, nice to have a second cable, but the OBD end of the cable is angled.  In my case, this cable won't work on my Subaru Outback.  I would prefer the option of a straight OBD connector.  Note that the angle connector works on my other four cars (Mazda, Honda, Dodge). Product shipped quickly. It is as described and will work fine for my vehicle. Do not order the Reese Power ball 72802 as the hitch mount is 3/4" and the draw bar is 1" mount. You'll need a bushing or return it for a larger mount.

Plus if one failed, the other one is close behind.That's it, you're done. This is such a useful tool when doing brake jobs. Simply place the tabs in between the pads and twist to push the pistons back. There is no need for positioning a C clamp or using vice grips and an extra set of hand to squeeze the pistons back. I highly recommend these mirrors. I did a lot of looking and comparing before I bought these. I have a 2006 Toyota Tacoma and these things fit well and do a real nice job.

It has to be closed just a slight bit harder to make the latch engage and when I open the door it pops out ever so slightly because of the extra tension produced by the hook being in there on the bottom. I don't see this as a problem. The mirrors are not on there all the time and, even if they were, I think the latch mechanism on the Toyota is stout enough to handle it without any long term problems developing. Just be aware that the hook will slightly change thge way the door latches.The instructions are good, too. Not the usual loosely translated Mandarin. I've tried to supplement here with my own experience. 
They only fit around a standard thickness roll bar not the newer jeep arrangement with the plastic cover shroud of the late models. I purchased this to secure my motorcycle.  I use it on my 1976 FXE Harley's front rotor.  It works well and secures the front with the lock and visible indication to hopefully make the thief move on to another bike.  The only problem I had with it was I wanted to put it on my rear wheel because that makes it much harder for a thief to take the bike.  My rotor's holes are too small for the pin to fit and the throat barely fit due to my rotor's thickness.  It does however fit well on my front rotor.Bottom line, this is a good, low cost solution to add as one additional layer of theft protection for your motorcycle. Fits my low clearance Mazda 5 that comes with alloy wheels and 3/4 inches of clearance between the inside of the tire and the suspension.  Have not tried it in the snow yet. 
This is such a useful tool when doing brake jobs. Simply place the tabs in between the pads and twist to push the pistons back. There is no need for positioning a C clamp or using vice grips and an extra set of hand to squeeze the pistons back. I bought a pair of these for my 2002 Grand Cherokee. It took a grand total of 5 minutes to install both of them, and half of that was spent looking for a screwdriver.If you are at all nervous about trying this, here is a overly detailed set of instructions.1. Open hood. Prop it open with something wooden so it doesn't fall on you.2. Identify the strut on the right side of the hood.3. Identify the small metal clip at both ends of the strut. If in doubt, look at the new ones. You are looking for a metal band, about 1/2 inch in width, with two small slots. On the vehicle, slide a small screwdriver blade into the clip's slots, and twist the screwdriver to pry the clip upward. You can remove it, or just loosen it enough that there is a good sized gap between the clip and the strut.4. Now pull the strut away from the hood/body. You may need to slide a screwdriver behind the strut arm to get a little bit of leverage. It is easier to start with the end attached to the hood.5. Remove both ends of the strut from the vehicle.6. Attach the new strut. Make sure the strut is aligned the same way as the old one-with the cylinder at the top of the strut. (Refer to the opposite strut). Just place the socket in the strut over the ball joint on the vehicle, and give it a little tap or squeeze with your hand. It should snap right on.7. Repeat on the other strut.Note- if it seems like the strut is too big, the hood is probably not open all the way. There is NO WAY you are strong enough to compress the strut by hand.I'd strongly recommend replacing them in pairs, otherwise you will get a twisting motion on your hood. Plus if one failed, the other one is close behind.That's it, you're done. These work great.Only need a small flat tip screw driver to pull back on the clips to remove the old ones and install the new ones.  Don't remove the clips completely, just pull them back a little bit and lift the hood gently at the same time.  2 people makes this a flash. 
...fits my 1973 Chevy/GMC 4x4 steering wheel perfect. Stretch it over the wheel and wrap the vinyl string around it nice and tight. The vinyl will break so just stretch it a little. Very well made unit, fits my Ford F150 and my Ram 2500 , Grease the snot out of it inside and out and install. The cover is a bit cheap but seems to work well. Double Double Check that you have the locking end on correctly, Just play with it before use and you will master it. Works good, installed on my 2012 Kaw Voyager 1700. I installed the unit on the bolt off the left side of radiator box. Use the the bracket from orginal horn to make that work, sound awesome too. 
I purchased this to be able to attach a high-end hydraulic assisted bike rake on the back of my Jeeps (JKs) with the rear tire still on.  It fit perfectly and teamed with the Bolt Lock BLT7018448 5/8'' Receiver Lock (Keyed specifically for your line of vehicle) it can be kept in the Jeep and my daughter doesn't need anything but her car key.The extender is exactly as advertised, well made, fit perfectly and does eactly what it is inteded for. I purchased this belt for my 2003 Chevy Tahoe. I had no idea Chevy would put 2 serpentines on a newer generation vehicle. This smaller belt fits the A/C system only. It works like a champ and fits perfectly. I would recommend the Gatorback belts to EVERYONE! As an installation side note, you have to remove the air intake and larger serpentine to get to this "bottom of the motor" mounted unit.... way to engineer that one GM! 3 things.#1 Spring is cheep and installed incorrectly. Snapped on unpacking so i had to twist it to place it the right (better) way and twist the ends toward inside more, because spring is made of cheep metal that bends like aluminum.#2 Size is too big for regular car filters. Toyotas/Hondas/Motorcycles ETC. Maybe a 5Lite For 3500 utility van will have enough filter diameter for this to fit around, or a huge SUV or a pickup truck.#3 Removal only. does not work the other way around to tight the filter. 
I have two cars, both of which require the large #14 sheet metal self-tapping screws to mount the plate to the nylon retainers behind the plate (the ones mounted on the car that the screws screw into). Problem is that diameter of the plastic ring that holds the screw covers is too small to take the screw's large diameter head. The maximum screw head diameter that will fit the ring is .435 inch (11 millimeters). Option 1: Replace the nylon retainers on the car, but different cars have different retainers so one must search for new ones that will accept a #12 screw. Option 2: Try to find #14 self-tapping screws with smaller heads. I shopped around for #14 screws with smaller heads to no avail. Option 3: Grind down the screw head's diameter. Option 4 (not good): On one car I used #12 sheet metal screws that have a smaller diameter, but DO fit the rings, and wrapped the threads with tape. This sort of works, but I really can't tighten them down satisfactorily. So I have to check their security now and then. I'm leaving the other car as is for now. Maybe someone has more practical ideas? Sure would like to hear of them. BTW, SEE THE UPDATE BELOW.UPDATE 11/16/13:I think I've found a viable solution to the above problem. I used a #12 sheet metal self-tapping screw, placed a 1/2-inch long piece of ordinary shrink tubing (1/4" i.d.) over the threads towards the pointed end of the screw. Used a heat gun (or you can use a match, BIC lighter or soldering iron) to shrink the tubing which effectively increases the thread diameter to about that of a #14 screw. This allows me to tighten the screw securely and will last much longer than ordinary tape. One more thing: The THICKNESS of the screw head doesn't quite allow the chrome cap to fully snap into place over the nylon ring. The top of the head needs to be filed down a little leaving enough Philips "X" to use the screwdriver. This doesn't fit my 2007 Toyota Tacoma factory hitch.  It needs to be 2 7/8".  The package on this lock reads 2 5/8 but I measured it at 2 3/4.  I'm going to have to grind the bolt.Update, Jan 2014.  An noted I had to grind the inside ends to make this fit in my Tacoma OEM hitch.  Once, it was ground to the proper length, I spray-painted the bolt and have used it to haul a 19-foot trailer and attach my tow hook ever since with no further problems. I bought a pair of these for my 2002 Grand Cherokee. It took a grand total of 5 minutes to install both of them, and half of that was spent looking for a screwdriver.If you are at all nervous about trying this, here is a overly detailed set of instructions.1.

Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend. Fits my low clearance Mazda 5 that comes with alloy wheels and 3/4 inches of clearance between the inside of the tire and the suspension.  Have not tried it in the snow yet. Could a wheel chock chock is a wheel chock could chock wheels?In this case: 2.Good build quality, worked well on my AG tires on the rear of the tractor. 
Does what it supposed to do,Fits most of my scooters.Does not fit a Honda Shadow 750's disc brake, because the disc is too wide.One star less, because the mechanism to mount the pouch to the handlebars is very weak, and impractical (I can't install it on handlebars of scooters because they have the handlebars covered with plastic, and can't install it on the handlebars of my motorcycle, because the hand grips and throttle are too wide, so it does not fit; the pouch also does not have a locking mechanism, so it's kind of moot to try to mount it somewhere).Otherwise, a great purchase! 3 things.#1 Spring is cheep and installed incorrectly.

Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. 
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. Great Fit Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. 
This doesn't fit my 2007 Toyota Tacoma factory hitch.  It needs to be 2 7/8".  The package on this lock reads 2 5/8 but I measured it at 2 3/4.  I'm going to have to grind the bolt.Update, Jan 2014.

Fits my low clearance Mazda 5 that comes with alloy wheels and 3/4 inches of clearance between the inside of the tire and the suspension.  Have not tried it in the snow yet. I ordered this to help make a better fit for the bike rack on the front of a Ford Expedition. I was specifically hunting for a fairly short extension because I wanted the bikes to stick out no further than necessary. The selection of holes in this extension allowed me to adjust the fit into the receiver, as well as the fit of the bike rack into the extension. This allowed me to fit the bikes about 2 inches closer to the vehicle than any other extension I was able to find. Very pleased with its performance. 
Perfect fit for rear window on my 2004 Ford Excursion Limited. Easy to install. No spotting seen or squeaking at all It fits fine on my 2012 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab.  I bought this and the stabilizer bar to keep my cooler(s) from trashing my truck bed.So EZ even a cavemen can use it!Ok, he might have a few cuts while trying!! Nobody else has mentioned it.  This is the K&N size for anyone who uses the Ford FL1A.  It also works in place of the Derale 13092. 
Have used it for several applications besides my MAF, and will be using it on a regular basis as needed. Mitt holds lots of water and both sides can be used as it is a flat style with cuff. Perfect for washing the RV...strong pole you can scrub as high as you need to go or can leverage. Holds its position when set.  Very pleased. 
I used this to change my front brakes recently. I had never used a tool like this before. I've always just used a C-Clamp on the caliper. This tool was very simple to use. You just put an old brake pad on the caliper piston, stick the tool in the caliper, and turn the knob. The tool feels sturdy enough to last through many brake jobs. It is easy to use. It was a little more difficult for my car because it has 2 piston front brake calipers, so I had to go back and forth in the caliper to make sure that both pistons got compressed. It still was not hard to use, it just took a few minutes longer.I am very pleased. I would buy this again, but based on how this felt when using it, I don't think I will have to. This review needs to be prefaced with an important fact: I have no spare tire and don't have run flat tyres.I decided that I was sick of worrying about what I'd do if I got a puncture in a part of the country were 265/40R18's weren't common (these are for a Porsche, they're an extremely uncommon size).  I went on a bit of a tyre repair buying spree, buying this in addition to a giant bottle of slime goo and a more generic set of plugs.  My car did come with it's own tire goo, but I didn't want to rely on OEM tire goo as my only option.Well, I got a puncture last night that left my tire completely flat when I got back to my car this morning.  All of my previous punctures kept air just fine so I could get to the tire shop for a proper repair, but this one wouldn't hold air even with the screw still in the tire.I figured this would be just as good a time as any to try out this product, since the tire just didn't hold air at all.  Really easy to use, the instructions were simple and clear.  I highly recommend their suggestion of using water on the plugs, otherwise it catches on the tool.  I put the first plug in, and it was leaking air just as much as with the screw.  I put in a second plug and it let out just a little bit of air, but much less.  I thought I'd just leave it at that, but in the end I put a third plug in.  It was completely sealed up, and water doesn't bubble up on it.  That was about 6 hours ago, and I just checked and it's held the same pressure as when I filled it up at the gas station.  I took the wheel off the car because I was safely in a garage, but I could see doing this on the side of the road with the Porsche air compressor.This isn't an expensive or interesting product, but what I love about is that it gives me more confidence when driving my completely impractical car on road trips!  I'm buying a new set of tires (the puncture was on a nearly worn out set of tires), so I can't attest to long term reliability, but I can say that for punctures which leave the tire intact, this product can help you get to a place to fix your tires for real!  I don't know whether this is considered a long term fix or not, but I won't be using it for tires I plan on using on the freeway. I figure my chance of needing this tool is about the same as being struck by lightning, but I bought two sets of these just the same (one for each car), in the midst of buying emergency gear for my daughter's new/used car.  They feel well made.  I looked at the knockoff version, but the reviews were not very good, so I went for the real thing.I did test the cutter on a piece of webbing that is similar to a seat belt.  The first time it went right though.  The second time took a little more work to get it started.  So I can see why some people felt it worked well, and others did not.  The problem is the seat belt material can fold over and make it hard to start the cut.  Once you get going, it goes pretty nicely, but it's not like slicing the webbing with a hot knife.  A good pair of scissors would likely work even better, but still, I feel this would do the job in an emergency. 
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.  The pickle fork is the last resort for me, as it will damage the balljoint boot.I prefer to use the Snap On balljoint remover.  If that one cannot fit, then I will try this tool.  If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork. IT WORKS

Looks and fits the same for a 2000 Toyota Sienna van. I ordered extra so I will not be without any at a later date. Exact replacement from OEM. Exact fit worked perfect . Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs. Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars 
a regular 32mm socket will not fit in the space of my equinox. this is a kind of shorter 32mm socket designed only for oil filter cap job. it works fine. I should have gotten the Honda cap.  This fits OK, but the screws are not "captured" in the cap.  With the original cap,the screws cannot fall out.  Considering the position of the screws when mounting this, captured screws are an advantage. Exact fit for Lexus RX300. As easy to install as I could've expected with all parts: the sensor, the cable and  the plug matching the original layout. 
bought this to use with a signal generator, and works great.  does just what I need.  will buy another if needed. This is the correct GM Oil Canister Socket for most of the new GM engines. If you think your 1-1/4&#34; or 32mm Sockets or wrenches will work you're gonna be all pissed off, buy this special socket now and save yourself for a huge problem. If you own a Hi-Lift, I may suggest to have this repair kit. You don't know when you will have to use it.

So, I can't comment on how well it works.  The main reason for this review is to put it out there that it does not work with a 2000 Chevy Silverado.  The siphon tube does not fit thru the bottom of the dip stick tube.  It would be really nice if Mityvac had a published list of what vehicles it works with and what ones it does not.  I have my fingers crossed that it'll work with my jet ski, otherwise there will be a new/(un)used Mityvac on *****'slist.  Long story short, do your research to see if you can confirm or deny if it will work with your vehicle before you buy it.

If you are considering purchasing this product for various uses at home, such as tires (cars and bikes, etc), mattresses, sport balls, and almost anything that need inflation, this product is the answer.Two cons: you'll need an extension cord and the PSI dial is not digital so you'll need to guessimate the actual PSI or you can get a digital pressure gauge to accurately measure your PSI. There is an acceptable itsy bitsy leak left. You can watch &#34;Fixing Oil Seal Leaks Fast&#34; video on YouTube by scottykilmer. You need 8 ounces for car engine or transmission usage, and 3 ounces for power steering. I am going to order more for power steering and transmission usage. I use this often to check the tire pressure on our cars, optimal tire pressure means better gas mileage and thread wear. This works fast and is accurate. The only option I wish this had was a beep on completion of check. I have used other gauges that beeps to tell me the test is completed which was a nice feature. 
a regular 32mm socket will not fit in the space of my equinox. this is a kind of shorter 32mm socket designed only for oil filter cap job. it works fine. Works as needed, only problem is it will only fit a standard oil jug not the gallon. I bought this belt for my 2003 Chevy Tahoe with the 5.3L engine and 145A Alternator. Make sure you know which alternator you have BEFORE purchasing this belt. The 105A alternators use a slightly shorter belt. It fits perfectly, doesn't make any noise and works great! You will also need the smallerGoodyear 4040377 Gatorback Poly V-Beltfor the A/C system on these vehicles.My 145 Amp Alternator has a 145A stamped on the side, visible from the drivers side. You could also look for the old belt part number on the existing belt and order accordingly. 
Made in China poor quality item that does not befit the Robert Bosch brand at all.Not for winter for sure.The origin of the product should be stated at the product page.If I knew it were a MADE-IN-CHINA I would not have bought it. These are well made, inexpensive, and work great. They are quality made in USA!And they had no shipping charges if added onto an existing Amazon order. Great quality.  American made. 
Works as needed, only problem is it will only fit a standard oil jug not the gallon. Does what it is designed to do and Amazon has great prices on them. But, if you are replacing yours on a ford f-250 with 5.4 go with 15718 with the longer cord. And a 2003 f250 w/5.4L only has 2 not 4 like it shows. This is an excellent product.  It really works best with Mercedes and BMWs where they also have the oil filter on the top of the car so you dont even need to get under the car to remove the oil filter.  Ive also used this on my Audi, which it works fine, but you still need to get under it to get the oil filter out.Also should point out, this wont work on some domestics because the way they snake their dipsticks into the oil pan.  Clear example is the Dodge Ram 04.  It comes with a tubing small enough to fit practically any car, but the dipstick on this truck snakes through to major curves so didnt work on that car.But I can say it will work for almost any import or german car.Dixit 
Bought it for oil extraction from a Mercedes and a SeaDoo.  Works great.  Also works for draining diffs, transfer cases, or transmissions before removing pans etc.  It can be kind of annoying to clean out but beats dealing with drain pans in hard to reach areas.  As the instructions say don't over pump.  10 pumps or so and just let it do it's thing.  The last thing you would want is for the reservoir to collapse in on you. Does everything. I can see when the tanks flush out clean. Has a valve so you can easily flush a tank and do it again if it needs more. Flush out the sewer hose when you are done. Should be standard item on a new RV. I use this product on rusted fuel filters,lawn equipment and just about any thing that gets rusty.The container is small and it has a brush attached to the lid so it makes it easy to apply. 
have used for transmission fluid changes, axle fluid and steering fluid changes. easy to use, solid construction, several hoses included in the kit that can be "daisy chained" for longer runs. Took several minutes to pull 2.7 qts of 75-140 oil but it was unattended. Very handy. No cracks or flaws in mine. There are 1 qt graduations on the side. Last year we installed this kit before winter and this year it took longer to move stuff around inside the camper to get access to the pump and heater bypass than it took to connect an pump anti-freeze through the pipes.  The other benefit is we use about 4 litres of anti-freeze to flush the pipes and do not have to put any into the holding tank. I have ordered this cleaner system for my 1999 Mitsubishi gallant. Pulled it into a full tank of fuel and used it until near empty. The engine runs much smoother now, I did not notice any significant fuel economy, but overall impressions are very positive. 
Does what it supposed to do,Fits most of my scooters.Does not fit a Honda Shadow 750's disc brake, because the disc is too wide.One star less, because the mechanism to mount the pouch to the handlebars is very weak, and impractical (I can't install it on handlebars of scooters because they have the handlebars covered with plastic, and can't install it on the handlebars of my motorcycle, because the hand grips and throttle are too wide, so it does not fit; the pouch also does not have a locking mechanism, so it's kind of moot to try to mount it somewhere).Otherwise, a great purchase! This debate just goes on and on...i don't know which is better. I have RP running in my transfer case and Amsoil in my tranny. Can i tell a difference? NOPE! They both seem to have great specs on paper with Amsoil has a slight edge on the viscosity around 100C degree, other than that, they are pretty much the same. Both are synthetic.  The only difference is RP is actually purple in color and you can get it off of Amazon. Amsoil, you have to buy direct. I originally boughtARB ARB605 Blue Inflator with Gauge and Braided Hosebut it had a leaking hose, so I returned it and got this.  A number of people say the gauge on this is too small.  I don't think the numbers on the gauge are much smaller than on the ARB Blue, but the Milton's gauge does feel harder to read.  I think it has more to do with the gauge being deeply inset behind thick glass/oil so light doesn't penetrate quite as easily as on the ARB's gauge, and the fact its measurement line is silver metal instead of bright red like the needle in the ARB's gauge.  Using a silver metal line is just stupid because it's a low contrast against a white background and black text and the silver partly reflects white light depending on how light strikes it making it even harder to see.  I think whoever designed this gauge "back in the day" decided it was somehow perfect and never needed any tweaks despite user complaints and other companies coming up with some better ideas.The junction between the red hose and gold pipe rotates which is nice if you want to push the filler against the tire at a convenient angle and still read the gauge.  The ARB doesn't have that feature which can leave its gauge hard to read because on a lot of tires you can only clip the hose on at a certain angle.One of the reviewers said the gauge measured pressure as you filled the tire, but that isn't true.  The gauge goes to zero while you fill, just like every other tire filler I've ever used, and only measures when you're not filling.  The gauge itself measured an identical value to a hand-held gauge I've been using forever.The description says the Milton has a "dual chuck" which I thought maybe meant you could rotate the silver end to press either side to the tire and one side might be made to connect to a different style of air connection.  But the silver part does not rotate and the air connection on both sides is identical.  I got the impression from another review that having a connection on the other side is useful if you have to push the hose into a tight space and pull the chuck back onto an air connection.The ARB comes with a type D quick disconnect already screwed in but on the Milton you have to supply your own sealing tape and screw in your own quick disconnect (ieLegacy A73457D Color Connex Type D 7 Piece 1/4 in. Red Coupler and Plug Kit).The ARB has a button you can use to release pressure from what you're inflating but the Milton has no such feature.  I don't think it's at all difficult to release some pressure on the chuck and just let air escape from the tire and that's probably easier than using a pressure-release button anyway.  Plus having a button creates another point that can fail during manufacture or after you've owned the tool for awhile.Despite the shortcomings, the Milton is much more solidly constructed than the ARB and the hose doesn't leak. 
Water Wetter is designed to be used in a system of solely distilled water. Water Wetter is then added to the mix to help the water have better contact with the metal.  Redline's claim is that with just water air will accumulate due to the heat on the metal's surface and this does not allow maximum heat transfer to the water. The Water Wetter will stop that air from forming thus allowing for more cooling potential. According to their results, up to 20 degrees.Now this can also be used in systems with a mixture of water and antifreeze but the results will be severly diminished, down to just a couple of degrees. On top of that beware of the "black sludge" that can accumulate with Water Wetter combining with certain types of Antifreeze. I would recommened using google to find results on this.Redline does recommened draining and refilling the system of Water Wetter and water once a year. This in my opinion is due to the fact that this is designed to be used in race cars and not so much street vehicles, yes even high performance street vehichles. If you are doing research you will find one over riding response "if you have a cooling system problem this will not fix it."I purchased this before I did enough research. I have decided not to use the product and take a loss on the investment. My car is a street car and I was going to flush my system and use only distilled water, since I live in an area that doesn't have to worry about freezing. After doing my research I will go with just a higher percentage of distilled water to antifreeze. This will help keep my maintenance time to a minimum and also increase my cooling efficiency. Does the job for which it was intended. Added to HOT water and dissolved, pour it into the base of the Air-O-Swiss humidifier to clean any 'scaling' and other 'old water' contaminants. Then thoroughly rinse (without dunking the base under water) and do this about every 2 months. I have been looking for a battery filler for my RV, as it is almost impossible to add water to the batteries any other way.  This baby does the trick in an instant, without over- or under-filling each cell AND no spillage.  Fill it with distilled water, screw on the cap, and the water inside does not evaporate, so it's always ready when your batteries need it. 
Very heavy duty plastic and solid construction.  These work as advertised (using on a 16 foot 2700 pound travel trailer with 24&#34; tires). Works great on my 2012 Wrangler Sport. Heavy duty rubber that fits well in my hitch receiver and looks like it will last awhile. This product works, looks and is great. Very well made and extremely strong. Wouldn't hesitate to use this with a very strong winch and a very heavy truck. 
Water Wetter is designed to be used in a system of solely distilled water. Water Wetter is then added to the mix to help the water have better contact with the metal.  Redline's claim is that with just water air will accumulate due to the heat on the metal's surface and this does not allow maximum heat transfer to the water. The Water Wetter will stop that air from forming thus allowing for more cooling potential. According to their results, up to 20 degrees.Now this can also be used in systems with a mixture of water and antifreeze but the results will be severly diminished, down to just a couple of degrees.

Although I bought expensive potable water hoses for my motorhome and gave them a good rinsing before connecting them, I still detected that distinctive "hose taste" in my RV's water.  Installing this filter between the hose and my RV eliminated that taste.  It also filters out odd odors and tastes that I encounter with some campground water.  When there are high chlorine levels in the water, this filter won't get rid of all of it but it does knock it down.  Be sure to rinse the filter for about one minute before connecting it to your RV for the first time or you'll get black carbon powder in your water.  The included flexible hose protector works perfectly; enabling me to connect the filter directly to my RV water inlet without the need for any other fittings, allowing me to close and lock the access door.After using one of these filters for about a year, I would not consider ever connecting my motorhome to any water supply without having this filter on-line. If you plan on traveling off-highway and transporting extra fuel, this makes transferring fuel from gas can to tank very easy.  I leave my gas cans mounted on the vehicle and transfer the fuel using this hose.  Saves time, avoids spills, and keeps my hands clean!  No more lifting those 40-pound cans and standing there waiting for them to drain!The way this works is simple.  There is a valve in the end of the hose that acts as a pump to prime the hose with fuel.  This enables you to siphon fuel without having to suck the fuel into the hose, which would be unpleasant at the very least, and potentially harmful at the worst.I insert the hose into the bottom of my 5 gallon fuel can, "jiggle" the hose until the fuel starts to flow, and then stand by while the fuel empties into my Jeep fuel tank.  The only requirement for this to work is that the bottom of the hose in the supply side be higher than the other end of the hose emptying into the destination side.I've had mine for years and it has never let me down! 
It does what it is supposed to do, that is to increase placement distance from the car to the electrical outlet I ordered this for a 2002 mercedes e320. This unit has to be connected to the swi-can to allow the steering wheel functions to work with an aftermarket head unit. The swi-can connects to the can harness and the swi-jack connects to the radio. It was fairly easy to install and the controls of my alpine head unit work from the wheel. I was told by crutchfield that there was no way to utilize the steering wheel controls on the e320 with the alpine radio. I am glad I found out about the swi-can and the swi-jack.The swi-jack was somewhat difficult to program at first. The thing to keep in mind is that the unit has preset functions so you have to either use each one with a button on the wheel, or skip it as the instructions say. There are some YouTube videos showing how to program it, that are helpful. The 3rd generation powerprobe includes a number of changes for additional flexibility.  In short, it is a vehicle powered DVM with both a 20 foot cable and an additional 20 foot extension giving you a 40 foot working range around either the battery terminals or cigarette lighter outlet, both clips and a plug are included in the kit.With the series 3 units they use a hard gold plated banana jack to hold the removable probe or cables to extend your reach.  If you purchase the accessory kit, it includes piercing probes that self center on a conductor, pierce the insulation, and attach to the jack allowing you to tap a wire at any point to locate intermittant problems.While the DVM is backlit all the time, it also has 2 bright white LEDs facing forward to aid in finding and probing terminals in dark places.  The actual probe is hardgold plated with a sharp tip and removable at the banana jack.  Another identical probe is included with a screw-in female banana jack in the accessories kit to retrofit the powerprobe I and II units to accept external cables and probes.If you need to excite a circuit with a connection to battery ground or to battery positive, the switch allows a momentary connection to bridge the probe tip to either voltage which is useful in testing relay driven circuits, indicator lights, and other small current loads.  The prope voltage is always displayed during testing on the meter. The voltage/ground switch is circuit breaker protected in case you accidentally drive 12 volts into a chassis ground.  Additionally, since the switch takes abuse it is easily replaced if it fails with just a screwdriver.Combined with the testlead set, the powerprobe 3 greatly simplifies testing of vehicular wire and big rigs up to a single trailer.  The DVM has 5 selectable modes of operation designed for different problems.  Reading the manual is important to get the full value from this meter.Although the price is a little high, the design and construction quality are excellent.  Enough wire is provided to check running lights on trailers or to look for blown fuses.  All of the wiring is exceptionally flexible and heavily insulated with top quality connectors.  Both the tester and accessories come in hard plastic cases that can be stowed in a service box.Not mentioned in specifications is that although the probe runs from 12-24 VDC, the meter can be used to measure voltages up to 80VDC. 
I'd consider myself a novice in the personal car care crowd.  When I was ready to sell my 13 year old Honda CRV and I poured through amazon and other website for the best stuff to detail my car, to get the best resale price, and I came across this product.  I took the online advice of others and I can't say I'm more pleased.  Using this product on my honda made it look only a few years old and brought the plastic and vinyl pieces back to life.  On the interior, the dash was super slick but no oily.  I even used it on the exterior of the car.  The black plastic bumpers had faded to a light gray, but when I applied the vinylex, they went back to black.  Anyways, I did get top dollar for my honda using vinylex and other car car products.  I hope this review can help others. I love this unit. Now I know in detail what's wrong with my car before I take it to the shop. This lessens the opportunity that the shop will try to upsell me on a service that I may not need. I also like the idea of being able to log the issues on my computer. I have used it on a 1993 Ford F150; 2001 Nissan Sentra; 3007 Lexus RX350 and a 2001 Cadi Deville I was asked to rewrite my review for some strange reason. I can only assume it was because the person approving my review didn't understand the product or the review.&#34;These work great for the backseat riders. It assists them in climbing up into my 2012 Wrangler. Arrived on time and adequately packaged.&#34;This review is for Rear Seat Grab Handles... their purpose is to give the backseat passengers something to &#34;grab&#34; onto. They are made for Jeep Wranglers. They fit the headrests of a 2012 Jeep Wrangler based on my personal experience with MY 2012 Jeep Wrangler. They arrived on time and weren't all jacked-up, so I can only assume that the packaging was adequate. 
If you are a do it yourselfer with auto repairs , this is a good tool to have in your tool box just in case. I needed to replace the inner tie rod on my 97 Corolla. I have a fairly well equiped shop but needed this specialty tool to do the job.This tool allowed me to remove the inner tie rod lock nut with ease. It has several difference sizes of fittings that allow it to be used on other vehicles.This tool paid for itself by me doing the job. It is well made and worth the price. Works as advertised. Very easy to manipulate to get to the valve stem to check pressure on my motorcycle. It should since that is what is was made for. 
The tool appears to be of average quality.  However, I returned it to Amazon since it did not fit up to a Ford Taurus flex fuel engine.  This type of engine requires a special fitting that this tool does not have. A good buy.  Does the same job that the Honda OEM part does. Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars 
For the price, this is a reliable and accurate gauge. I keep a digital tire gauge in all my cars, and the readings this unit gives is consistent with the others. I have not encountered any challenges re type of rim in using this gauge. Fits fine. A number of reviewers have commented that the accuracy of this gauge is 0.1 psi.  It isn't.  The accuracy spec is +- 0.5 psi +- 1% of the reading.  This means that the gauge could show anything between 34.1 to 35.9 for a tire actually filled to 35 psi.Long story short...don't believe that 1/10 digit number that's being displayed.  If there's a slight change in tire pressure, it'll show it, but the actual value can vary significantly from what's shown. I don't know how many of you remember the definitions of accuracy and precision from high school chemistry, but this product is both! I compared it to two other inaccurate tire gauges and this one was the only consistently accurate gauge after comparing at the dealership. Highly recommended considering its price and durability. 
Excellent adapter, I'm using it in my solar system, I use it to connect the battery to the charge controller, and as additional value has an integrated fuse holder which prevents any damage to the system, very well designed and built! Nobody else has mentioned it.  This is the K&N size for anyone who uses the Ford FL1A.  It also works in place of the Derale 13092. This is the best stabilizer I've ever used. Absolutely awesome! I use it in all of my power equipment. Lawnmower, chainsaw, power washer, boat, etc. 
the nut fitting is the perfect answer to the cramped space inside the vx cruiser--way better than the OEM.  Excellent product from K&N. I put a review in on the longer serpentine belt. The tire like tread on these belts help give them better grip on the pulleys and wheels. I like them better than the individually ribbed belts. Excellent wiper blades, easy to install, and perfect size match for a 2009 Altima Hybrid.  The car requires a bracket-less blade to look right and the Bosch look better then the original factory wipers.  Not much else to say here..but they are GREAT thus far. 
Made in China poor quality item that does not befit the Robert Bosch brand at all.Not for winter for sure.The origin of the product should be stated at the product page.If I knew it were a MADE-IN-CHINA I would not have bought it. Considering this is made in China, it is a quality product, too bad all my locks are keyed to the some number These are well made, inexpensive, and work great. They are quality made in USA!And they had no shipping charges if added onto an existing Amazon order. 
I love the simplicity and reliability of this unit. It comes with 4 alligator clips and 4 O ring clips to hardwire to something like my atv. I hardwired the connector to the quad so all i need to do it connect and disconnect the quick connect clips. This product appears to include the cable. IT DOESN'T. It's just the mount which it does okay, but you'll have to buy the cable separately. Product shipped quickly. It is as described and will work fine for my vehicle. Do not order the Reese Power ball 72802 as the hitch mount is 3/4" and the draw bar is 1" mount. You'll need a bushing or return it for a larger mount. 
I use it for my dual back tires in a Ford 350 chassis. It would not register the tire pressure accurately. It was hard to get a tight seal around the valve stem. I will try the CH tire inflater with the built in gauge and the chuck that hopefully will get a tight seal on the valve stem. This air gauge is dead on accurate, it seals completely, allows air to flow the way it should and the two headed chuck fit all cars, trucks and even those pesky hard to reach motorcycle valve stems. I own three motorcycles and there is nothing more aggravating than trying to fit a chuck in between rotors, fork tubes and tight spaces on a motorcycle. You know what I mean. This two headed angled chuck is angled perfectly to fit over a cycle stem without leaking or having to bend the valve stem. I love it. THIS IS THE PERFECT TIRE PRESSURE GAUGE FOR CHECKING TIRE PRESSURE ACCURATELY, QUICKLY AND EASILY.  SIMPLY PUT THE END OVER THE VALVE STEM, HOLD IT FIRMLY FOR A SECOND OR TWO AND READ THE PRESSURE.  THE GAUGE ON THE NEW TIRE PUMP IS NOT CORRECT AND NEITHER IS THE PRESSURE GAUGE ON THE ELECTRIC TIRE PUMP THAT ATTACHES TO THE CIGARETTE LIGHTER. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE ACCUTIRE MS DIGITAL TIRE PRESSURE GAUGE. 
This is a water additive that can potentially increase your cooling capacity by a few degrees by lowering surface tension and increasing boiling point. It does what it is supposed to do, that is to increase placement distance from the car to the electrical outlet Basically, this is a voltmeter, similar to a hand-held VOM, and designed to read static voltage and the voltage being pushed to the battery from the alternator as the engine revs ... automobile or motorcycle (having a 12v socket).  The cigarette lighter convenience is what attracted me ... I don't have to juggle a meter and wires with my head under the hood or standing alongside the bike trying to rev it and hold wires and meter, etc.  Tested it already and it seems dead-on with readings at or just a tad under what the hand-held shows.  It's coming on to winter and it's nice, when checking fluids and tire pressure, to do periodic checks on the charging system so you don't get that gut-dropping &#34;click-click-click&#34; when you turn the key in some dark, empty parking lot somewhere you don't want to be! 
handy. when you go to dump, connect the sewer hose to the dump and then hold the end under the cap. Slowly loosen the gardern hose cap. If either of your blade valves has leaked or been opened you will have some &#34;water&#34; here and you will catch it and drain it into your sewer hose instead of all over the ground in front of everyone at the dump station. Can also be used for backflushing if you're careful and use backflow preventer. Very simple to hook to drainage hose. Make sure the one end is secured to the sewer hose rinser and the other hooked into a sewer drain. Turn on the water and let the sewer hose get cleared out of any left over debris. This makes cleaning out the drainage hose easy and you stay dry while doing it. This kit makes it super easy to winterize your camper. This 3 way valve will allow you to easily the pump pull from the gallons of pink RV antifreeze. When spring comes around you just need to turn the valve so it pulls from your fresh water tank and flush out the lines with fresh water. 
A number of reviewers have commented that the accuracy of this gauge is 0.1 psi.  It isn't.  The accuracy spec is +- 0.5 psi +- 1% of the reading.  This means that the gauge could show anything between 34.1 to 35.9 for a tire actually filled to 35 psi.Long story short...don't believe that 1/10 digit number that's being displayed.  If there's a slight change in tire pressure, it'll show it, but the actual value can vary significantly from what's shown. If you are considering purchasing this product for various uses at home, such as tires (cars and bikes, etc), mattresses, sport balls, and almost anything that need inflation, this product is the answer.Two cons: you'll need an extension cord and the PSI dial is not digital so you'll need to guessimate the actual PSI or you can get a digital pressure gauge to accurately measure your PSI. I ordered this set of mirrors to help me see behind my camper.  They are very easy to use and are very firmly mounted.  IMPORTANT: Go to the manufacturer's website to find the exact model for your truck.  The Amazon site might tell you the wrong model for your truck.  I recommend this product. 
Well built meter that functions just as it should.  The dials are easy to read and as far as I can tell the meter is accurate. This meter should be used as a general indication of voltage only. I checked it against a calibrated professional meter and found it to be reading 4 volts high. This put the reading in the read area when in fact the voltage was acceptable. I will still use it on my generator and simply subtract 4 volts from the reading. Used this way it is marginally effective. I probably should compare it to another to see how accurate it is, but I really like how easy it is to use and turns off and on by itself. 
I bought two sets / 4 total. I use them near the middle of the lifting range which puts the saddle about 18 to 19 inches high. This is perfect to get my truck off the ground and give me an inch or so of ground clearance to R&R; the tires and do other work underneath the vehicle.I don't need 6t worth of lift, but I like how these j/s have a wide lifting range. With these set for my range (as stated above), they are not teetering at the top of the range like others I've used in the past, but are comfortably in the middle. They are very stable and solid units.It would be helpful if the info stated the lifting range of the units, not just the tonnage they can support as a pair.Min. Lift Height (in.)14 29/32Max. Lift Height (in.)23 1/2 the bag it came with dosent fit it, if youve got it adjusted to the middle or top setting, this does exactley what they say, seems pretty rugged, it fits my duratrac 245/75/16s perfect and holds my 225lb self no prob. Just opened my mail and a 3.5 inch long air hammer bit is what I measured. Not the 5.7 inch as the ad says on Amazon.com. Hope it still works out OK. I wanted longer one that would reach into the hollow van sliding door, as well as the hollow rear-side panel. It's a nickle coin size and flat on the impact end. I was looking for a arched shape, but this will do? 
These were a perfect fit for my 2001 Silverado 2500HD with the 6.0 but I had to do some research to make sure I bought the correct wire set.  GM used round or square coils (two different manufacturers) for a few years and the plug wire lengths are different. If you have the round coils (plug wire connector on the bottom of the coil) you need these shorter wires ending in &#34;GG&#34;.  If you have the square coils with the plug wire connector on the side of the coil, you need the longer wires ending in &#34;HH&#34;. The HH wires are about 1.5 inches longer for than the GG's.  You cannot make the shorter wires reach a square coil. There are two horns, not one. One is 400Hz and the other one is 500Hz.PIAA | Automotive Sports Horn (400/500Hz) #85110The are exact fits on the mounts as the OEM horns and use the same bolts. A 1/4 inch drive ratchet and a 12mm socket is needed to remove and install the bolt. They came with grounding leads with ring spade lugs that mounted readily under the existing M6 bolts on the radiator supports. All you need is a 10mm socket.The two wiring harness leads are too short to connect the horns. Two wire tie mounts hold the harness to the aluminum bumper reinforcement. You can cut off the ties and use the OEM harness to connect the horns, but I chose not to.  I prefer NOT to cut off the OEM connector blocks.I made two pigtail extensions out of 18 gauge black primary wire, 5 inches long. One end needs a 1/4 inch wide exposed male quick disconnect. The other end needs an insulated female 1/4 inch quick disconnect terminal. Since I used 18 gauge wire, I used the red coded ones.The exposed male connector slides into the OEM horn connector perfectly. The female one clips easily onto the positive terminal of each horn.The horns how have a weather shield on the apertures.Best thing to my surprise is that they appear to be very high quality and Made in Japan.Also nice is that they need no modification to the horn relay or circuit. Great feeler gauge!Equip it in Corrosion-X, or WD40 for long lasting.Great to measure spark plug gaps, for performing valve adjustments (valve gap), etc... 
They are a bit slick and need to be sand blasted or something. I would not buy these for any Tire size 15 inch or smaller. Get a 4x4 , cut it, use it. I still use the square aluminum jack stands and I guess it really all depends on the brand you have or something cause these pads needed to be about 1/8&#34; bigger to fit mine so I was not pleased with that though I didn't have anything to block up my tongue when parked so these worked for that I guess. They need to make these things a TINY bit bigger then they can put a picture of a basic jack stand on the front .... till they do it;s really false advertising cause they do not fit either sets of my regular square aluminum jack stands. I did order these for a banding tool, but had to return them because the bands I use don't work with this tool. Although that being the case, these are a well built tool and would probably be the stuff when used with the correct type of band. 
GLAD  I  WENT  WITH  THE  CHROME AND  NOT  THE BLACK ONE, I  HOOKED  THIS ONE UP TO  MY GV1400 MOTORCYCLE IF  YOU  HAVE JUST  A  LITTLE  KNOW  HOW YOU CAN  DO  IT YOUR SELF , ALL  YOU WILL NEED TO GO WITH THIS IS A RELAY THAT DOES NOT COME WITH IT. YOU  CAN  GET IT ON HERE OR ANY PART STORE, I  HAVE MADE MANY PEOPLE JUMP  DUE  TO THE SOUND OF  THE  HORNS  LOUDNESS. Fair price and does what it's supposed to do. It's handy for when you don't want to work directly at the car. Good product for the cost. I am happy with them. They are basically hooks that go under the head rest. If your head rest doesn't detach this might be a problem. Also they move around a lot so if you need something that doesn't move this wouldn't work for you. 
As good as the factory original. Thanks for the tip from one of the other reviewers to drill a small hole in the top of the cap in order to attach the existing leash. (It doesn't come with one) No lack of quality here.  Threads are good, insulator is solid, tip screws off if you have the other style connector.  Does what it should. I've been a regular user of Permatex silicone spray for over ten years.  I use the spray mostly as preservative for rubber, plastics, and other synthetic materials, and as a lubricant for things like lock mechanisms, zippers, screws, and joints.  I apply it to the rubber hoses and sealing strips in my car, my bicycle tires, running shoes, nylon cases and luggage, and even camera gear.  Silicone is also a good electrical conductor.  After cleaning electrical contacts, I apply a little spray, which seems to improve performance and deters corrosion.Unlike CRC's silicone spray which can react with and deface and damage certain plastics, Permatex's silicone spray has never damaged anything that I have used it on.  The spray comes with a tiny plastic tube that you can insert into the spray nozzle, so that the spray can be concentrated and applied in a confined area, like the key slot in a lock.  The only real gripe I have is that the product has a tendency to foams up when sprayed, and this is exacerbated when the tube is attached.  The resulting "spray" is usually really messy, and hard to apply evenly.  Other than this, I have no major complaints about the product, which has apparently been in production for over 90 years.Silicone spray is flammable, but not exceedingly so.  Still care should be exercised in its use, and adequate ventilation should be provided.  The Permatex spray can holds 10.25 ounces, which is more than theCRC 05074 CRC product.  The Permatex spray costs about $4.50 at my local store, so you might want to check around for the best price. 
Handy to have on the road to check air pressure in suspension and tires. Be sure to check with the Auto or Truck Manufacturer to find the correct SIZE of Oil Filter for your vehicle. Amazon's Parts Locator says that the Motorcraft  FL820S does not fit my 1995 Mercury Grand Marquis, 4.6 Litre V-8 engine. This is incorrect. The fact is that the Motorcraft FL820S is the FORD-recommended filter for my 1995 Mercury engine, and is recommended in almost every application of the Ford /Mercury/Lincoln 4.6 Litre engine size.The Motorcraft FL820S interchanges with the BOSCH 3410, the FRAM TG2, and the K&N; 2010.The Motorcraft FL820S  has over 50 pleats, high flow rate, silicone anti-drainback valve, and steel end caps.Amazon's current low price ($3.69) is an excellent value for a quality oil filter that's MADE IN USA !!My car is driven in heavy traffic, desert temperatures, mountain driving, and trans-desert trips from Phoenix to L.A.The standard FORD Motorcraft Filters performed just as well as the high-dollar types -- and filtered MUCH better than the K&N;, which has a very high flow rate (for racing), but the low 90% efficiency rating of the K&N; makes it a no-no for extended oil changes. I wouldn't run a K&N; oil filter for more than 3,000 miles -- you'd just be stirring up dirty oil and pumping it through the bearings !! :>(For my American V-8 engine, I have found the best value to be the Motorcraft FL820S Oil Filter and Mobil 1 5-W-20 Extended Life (Synthetic) engine oil. The quality of the oil filter allows for filter changing every 5,000 miles, and the engine oil is changed once-a-year, regardless of miles driven.For maximum oil life, be sure your PCV system is working properly -- Remove and wash out the PCV Valve with Carburetor  Cleaner, and check for collapsed and/or damaged PCV hoses.

Motion Pro Cable LuberThe latest version of this tool has TWO thumb screws.I purchased this tool because it was recommended as a basic tool for maintaining your motorcycle or any other vehicle/device that uses cables. Well, after talking to some experienced riders, they all exclaimed that lubricating the cable (clutch or throttle) is a good idea, but they generally have never done this in over 20-30 years. Looking at the latest motorcycles, the cables don't really allow you to lubricate them using this tool or any tool for that matter. On my Ducati, there are rubber boots that prevent you from injecting lube into the sheath assuming you can use the tool and reach the sheath. On my Ford, the throttle cable sheath isn't thick enough to form a tight seal with the Motion Pro tool. It almost seems like the OEMs don't want you to lubricate the cables. On top of it, modern cars and the latest motorcycles use drive-by-wire which is totally electronic where your throttle input (pedal or twist grip) is connected to a potentiometer that tells the computer your desired throttle angle/input, and it activates a stepper motor that opens/closes the throttle plates accordingly. So if you're interested in maintaining your new bike or car with this tool, you might want to reconsider buying the tool.If you have a vehicle that uses cables and has a sheath that is accessible and large enough to form a seal, this tool is very easy to use and well made. Just slide the cable through the slit, push the tool up against the sheath entrance, clamp down the screws, and insert your lubricant nozzle/tube into the open port. Then use rags to seal the tool and the exit of the cable sheath, and squirt away.Overall: 4/5 stars, the rubber seal could have been designed to accommodate really skinny cable sheaths. Newer bikes and cars don't need/can't use this tool. I love the simplicity and reliability of this unit. It comes with 4 alligator clips and 4 O ring clips to hardwire to something like my atv. I hardwired the connector to the quad so all i need to do it connect and disconnect the quick connect clips. Fabulous unit, compact, quiet, powerful, and not too heavy. I cut off the alligator clamps and wired it to a 7-way trailer connector so that I can plug it in to the rear of my truck. 12v is only present when the truck is running so this is a foolproof setup. I like the 100% duty cycle although I do not expect that to be an issue. 
I've owned Xantrex and Duracell jump starters in the past. Unlike those and similar products, the JNC does only one thing and does it really well -- starts engines like a champ. For the equivalent starting power in one of the multifunction Chinese-made products, you'd need to buy a bigger and heavier power pack for considerably more money.I've used the 300XL to start 4-, 6- and 8-cylinder engines. It had no problem with any of them. Starting a 4-cylinder engine is so effortless, I imagine I could start a whole parking lot row of them with one charge. The vehicle I actually carry the jump starter around in is a 2007 Lincoln Town Car with a big V8 engine. One night, my alternator died and the battery drained completely before the car finally went dead on the highway. Not only did I start the engine with the JNC 300XL, but I left it connected and used it to power the car while I drove it to my all-night mechanic (with the headlights off). This drained it flat, so I recharged it as soon as I could and it was fine.There's no AC inverter in this product, but the flashlight attachment pops out to reveal a 12V socket that you can use to power/recharge laptops, mobile phones and suchlike. I use to to power my air compressor to inflate tires. Speaking of which, I have a really good compressor that I bought using the money I saved by purchasing the JNC instead of a multifunction power pack, which would have included a really cheap air compressor made out of plastic parts. This stuff is awesome. I put my first bottle (about half of it) in my ATV which was running a little rough. Threw some in the fuel tank and then sprayed some (with a spray bottle) directly into the carb while running. Let it sit for 5 minutes and repeated. It instantly ran smoother and had better throttle response. I thought okay, not bad for a quick &#34;miracle in a bottle&#34;. So i went over to my weed wacker which would run like crap at anything over half throttle. I figured if this stuff could fix my weed wacker than it has my approval.  I added a little to the fuel and repeated the same process (spraying in the carb and letting it sit twice). It smoked a ton but ran like it was straight out of the box new. SOLD! I love this stuff.Long story short I bought three more bottles and put it in both of my vehicles, my snowblower, generator, leaf blower, lawn mower, outboard mower, and anything else with an engine. Everything runs like it is brand new. Forget bringing your stuff to get fixed by a mechanic. For cheap money up front you can do a little preventative maintenance and stabilize, clean the gunk out of your machines, and keep them running smoothly.When I put it in my vehicles, I threw a third of the bottle in the fuel tank, SLOOOOWLY (READ SLOWLY) dripped a third of the bottle in my vacuum line, and may toss the last third in the oil right before my next oil change. If you throw it in the oil you need to change the oil and filter within 100 miles or it will be bad for the engine. Don't put it in the vacuum line quickly or you will hydrolock your motor and destroy your engine. You will be fine as long as you slowly drip it. DO NOT &#34;slurp it&#34; by sticking the vacuum line in the bottle. People do this all over youtube and it's the wrong way to do it. That is a recipe for disaster.  Just buy it and you will love it. As the title says, I am satisfied with my purchase.  I like that there is no extra power supply to keep track of and carry around to charge the device.  As far as I am concerned being able to just plug any standard work type extension cord is genius!  The AC power supply works as advertised but the inverter cooling fan is rather noisy.  You can hear it from one room of the house to the other.  The LED light is smart as LEDs use very little energy.  There are consistent complaints about the air compressor taking forever to inflate a tire.  The problem is not in the air compressor but the little black nipple at the end of the house.  One must, with the lever first up, push the inflation fitting all the way onto the tire valve stem by twisting the fitting and gently pushing until  you can see none of the brass fittings and then push down the lever to connect the hose and open the valve on the valve stem.  If you do this correctly, you will see the actual tire pressure currently in the tire on the air pressure gauge.  If the air hose fitting is not on the valve stem properly, when you turn on the inflator, the air pressure will initially say 0 psi until you turn on the pump and then the pressure will jump up to 100psi.  What is happening in this situation, is that the air compressor is trying to push against a closed valve.  It will VERY SLOWLY push air into the tire.  Make sure you have the fitting right and it will work very quickly.  Black and Decker should put a better air hose fitting on the end of the hose to eliminate this issue.As stated, everything works.  Ultimately, I will use the dc receptacles to charge the device via solar panels through a charge controller.Update as of 9/19/2009I have had this unit for some time now and have been charging it via the 12 volt cigarette lighter with a small 30 watt array using two Sunforce 15watt panels in parallel.  I use a Sunforce 7 amp charge controller to protect the battery in the device. I can easily charge this unit in about 6 hours from a depleted point at which the inverter auto shut off to protect the battery the night before.  I get 5 to 6 hours of light from a standard torche lamp in my living room with a 23 watt cfl installed.  I recently started charging it in parallel with a old jump starter pack I had been given as an anniversary gift at a job. If I am only using 6 hours of the sun, I am not storing all the energy I can.I now run the Electromate in the living room for about 5 hours to power the lamp and the Jump start pack gets a 75 watt inverter plugged into it and I run an identical setup upstairs in my computer room.I want backup power in an emergency and a very good way to get the bugs out is to use it continually so the problems will pop up at I time when I don't really need emergency power, instead of at the most inopportune time. 
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. These work on my 2012 F150. They fit perfectly with no vibration at all. An excellent product and I highly recommend them! IT WORKS 
Replaced the "nasty nissan matic fluid" with this in the transmission and also used it in the power steering and transfer case in my 2005 nissan titan. I use this exact filter on my 05 Honda Silver Wing. Honda recomends Torqing the filter. And the 17mm Nut makes it easy. Bought the bike used with about 2k miles. Rode 1500 miles and my oil is still clean. This is a Heavy filter for its size. Due to the steel case. I have previously used in: 1980 Honda CX500C to fix a rough idle, 2000 Suzuki SV650 to stabilize fuel, and a 2005 Chevy Cobalt to fix a problem with stalling at idle. 
Bought this to use withValterra F02-4100 45 RV Hydroflushso I could wash out my tanks.Here is my review of that setuphttp://www.amazon.com/Valterra-F02-4100-45%C2%B0-RV-Hydroflush/product-reviews/B0002UHVAA/ref=cm_cr_dp_synop?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints;=0&sortBy;=bySubmissionDateDescending#R2CUAU2B8XC98QIt works great.I also like that I have this as an emergency backup if one of my valves ever fails. Perfect for exhaust work.  I bought it for a catalytic converter and o2 sensor project because it is rated for: -30F to 1800F Love it. This thing seems very strong and sturdy. Has a weather cap to keep the key opening dry. It went on the trailer well. I also use a receiver lock as well. Great theft deterrent. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W0MW2C/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_5 
I've an Optima in my old Corvette that has now failed.  I've have read thru their warranty information.  It states that the battery must be returned to the selling dealer for warranty service.  It cannot be returned to Amazon for any reason.  Therefore my question is this:If the battery purchased thru amazon should require warranty service, how is this done and by whom? Any tech should have one of this when recommending replacement of a customers tire. Some states require you have this for state inspection. I preferr this over the other brands due to warranty. Battery Tender warranty a joke, They charge shipping and repair cost under their warranty. I replaced my Battery Tender w/ these. I have used this brand on my tractor and 4 wheelers. I am getting over 5 years of battery life on both w/ this. 
Well made Excellent quality.  American made.  Top notch all the way around.  Built to last. Great quality.  American made. 
So I had the misfortune of having to replace my brakes recently. I purchased one of these brakes spring tools and I am glad I did. You will see that the end piece of this tool, which has a one inch adjuster, the black piece. Slip the grooved area onto the straight part of the spring and turn the handle to tighten; it sure does make it a lot easier to stretch a new spring. I have tried to remove the springs with a vise grip and pliers but the brake spring tool is so much easier and Best $5 I have spent on a long time! I purchased 2 packages of these coil compressors (so 4 compressors total) a while back knowing i would need them to swap out a set of springs from 1998 Chev Camaro.  I was installing shocks and lowering coils to improve handling and get rid of some body roll.  On the Camaro, the rear is a solid axle so the coils and shocks install separately (its not a coil over shock system as in the front).  While compressing the rear spring, I ran out of room...the threaded bar portion was making contact with the top of the coil's housing so i used the extra 2 compressors i had to compress the coil further until i could remove it...So the compressors did their job easily. its a good product and very well made however, you may need 3-4 of these compressors to help further compress the coils.on the front, the coils and shocks were out of the car so no space issues and two compressors easily compressed the coil...i used 3 to be safe. Front side (towards the engine) oxygen sensor fit "exactly." That means there is not a bit of "extra" wire from the sensor to the connector. They do make one with a longer cord, but not sure why, because you can't get your hand/arm in there any better with a longer cord anyway!I did the front sensors on both sides of the car, because someone recommend it to keep things running smoothly on both sides. Glad I did, it seems to be working.Got a wrench? I ordered a fancy pants "socket" from Amazon along with the sensors to get into the "tight" spot. It turned out that the fancy sockets do NOT fit on the front sensors, at least not on this car, and then I ran around town trying to find one of those fancy pants "special" wrenches with the "split" socket on the end, but nobody had them.In desperation, and hoping for the best, I purchased a standard 7/8" combination wrench (where the heck is mine anyway?) to get the sensor off. Oops, I put the wrench on the old sensor and it wasn't even tight (probably why it gave me the DTC)! Installation was easy, aside from the arm and hand contortions getting the plugs loose (try a long shaft screwdriver from below to pop the clip while you're holding the other end from above).Note, on my car, "bank 1" is the cylinder set on the passenger side of the car! 
Well I bought new wiper arms to replace the rusting ones on my 2001 Silverado pickup. Showing my age, I thought it had a straight splined shaft with a release lever. The shaft is tappered and removal of the arm requires a puller. This puller worked perfectly and is easy to use. In my opinion, Lisle is a good brand of automotive tools. We only have stabilizing jacks on the back of the trailer so we do use the tongue jack as a stabilizer too.  My husband always carried a bucket of pieces of 2 x 4s to support the post.  We decided to try this reasonably priced jack stand instead.It is VERY heavy-duty and does a perfect job.  They sent us a red one, not the black as shown in the photo, but that doesn't effect my rating at all.  For the money, this is an excellent accessory. This works fantastic at keeping your Hopkins brand trailer wiring harness secure and looking good. With some minor modification I used this in conjunction with a  Curt 58001 Easy Mount Electrical Bracket for 2&#34; Receiver Tube and am extremely pleased. 
Nice product. To install you remove the headrest and then slip the ends of the strap through the head rest poles. Simply re-insert the headrest and you are all set. I have a 2012 JKU and passengers who ride in the back love it. Helps them (especially the shorter ones) get in the Jeep. Rugged Ridge grab handles are working great in our 2011 Jeep Unlimited.  I bought a set for front and back. My husband installed these on his 97 Cherokee in just 10 minutes.  Remove 2 bolts on top of each lift support and place a screwdriver under the spring clip on bottom and the ball joint connection on the lower end slips right on.Trunk now stays up and doesn't hit him in his head! Worth the time and money for sure.Be sure to support the trunk with a 2x4 or long broom handle before removing old lifts. Save the bolts because there are no bolts provided with the new lifts. 
Bought for my new Corvette.  Chevy sells a similar (if not the same0 product for a much higher price.  The CTEK web site shows this unit brand labeled for BMW, Audi, Maserati and Lamborghini so it may well be the unit Chevy buys brand labeled.It has a 4 mode charging system.  The last is a pulsed maintenance mode so it can be kept on all the time for when the car will not be used for several weeks.  Well-made and comes with a bag to hold it and the accessories, that I put on a pegboard hook in the garage. I purchased this back in 1992 for my Oldsmobile and have used it on every car since: Accord, Civic, Integra, GTI, 240SX, 200SX, Maxima, Sentra and I could go on... You name it and it works. If you have a super wide filter or really tight space where the ratchet attaches, it may not be ideal. In my opinion, it's worked on 95% of the vehicles I've owned and this tool is awesome! Installed this on my Lifted jeep comanche.  Used it in the factory location.  Helped reduce the dreaded DW.  I've since replaced all my shocks with this same product line and love them too.  Great strength. 
Made in China poor quality item that does not befit the Robert Bosch brand at all.Not for winter for sure.The origin of the product should be stated at the product page.If I knew it were a MADE-IN-CHINA I would not have bought it. Valterra is known for quality RV products and accessories, this is no exception. Shipping was on time and product was exactly what I was expecting. Very cheaply made product. It works but could be made with better quality product. Probably wouldn't buy this product again 
This tail bag easily attaches to the motor cycle. 4 straps with a loop on one end and a quick connect on the other.  Also there is one strap with quick connects on each end and all are adjustable length. good bag for the price. There are two horns, not one. One is 400Hz and the other one is 500Hz.PIAA | Automotive Sports Horn (400/500Hz) #85110The are exact fits on the mounts as the OEM horns and use the same bolts. A 1/4 inch drive ratchet and a 12mm socket is needed to remove and install the bolt. They came with grounding leads with ring spade lugs that mounted readily under the existing M6 bolts on the radiator supports. All you need is a 10mm socket.The two wiring harness leads are too short to connect the horns. Two wire tie mounts hold the harness to the aluminum bumper reinforcement. You can cut off the ties and use the OEM harness to connect the horns, but I chose not to.  I prefer NOT to cut off the OEM connector blocks.I made two pigtail extensions out of 18 gauge black primary wire, 5 inches long. One end needs a 1/4 inch wide exposed male quick disconnect. The other end needs an insulated female 1/4 inch quick disconnect terminal. Since I used 18 gauge wire, I used the red coded ones.The exposed male connector slides into the OEM horn connector perfectly. The female one clips easily onto the positive terminal of each horn.The horns how have a weather shield on the apertures.Best thing to my surprise is that they appear to be very high quality and Made in Japan.Also nice is that they need no modification to the horn relay or circuit. I've been climbing around under cars since 1959 and these jack stands are sweet.  One can drop a four wheel drive on these puppies and they're not going flex.  Or one can get their sports car up to a "DECENT" working height of a shade under twenty-four inches.It doesn't matter if these have a capacity of six tons each or they're six tons for two of them because they're shipped and you're going use them......as a pair.  Our full size F-250, with tool boxes is 8,800 pounds so what do I care if they're not six tons each?  They're going be holding up a single corner or side of the vehicle at a time.  In the meantime, the spec sheet packaged inside the box the jack stands are packed in, clearly spec these jacks at 6T "each."If you need to be reassured, call the manufacture's customer service line between 8-5 PST @ 1-888-448-6746 and let customer service tell you directly what the truth is regarding any of your questions.On our jack stand copy, I checked the delivered jack stand base welds and found all gusset welds and manufacturing quality control, to be good to excellent manufacturing/welding.  I checked out the stamped sheet metal parts and found the stamped sheet metal work to be "excellent."  There was nothing in the manufacturing of our jack stands that would seem abnormal (a standout), cheap or inappropriate for a product of this kind.This is not a high end, tech grade, stainless steel, high pressure fitting where each weld is x-ray'd.  This is a typical red and black jack stand one uses at home or a shop to support a car, pickup, flatbed or box truck for the purpose of safely making repairs under a jacked up vehicle.  Used normally, with safety in mind during proper placement, there's no reason to believe that if you use these jack stands, you won't be able to safely get under a vehicle, make your repairs and get on to the next item on your check list.Overall, I am very pleased with the pair of auto jacks we received and I feel comfortable recommending these beasts to all who find themselves to be mechanically inclined and in need of safely crawling around under their jacked up vehicle. 
Read some good ( I think ) articles about antifreeze and this stuff. I am going to try it out. I do a lot of low speed, low rpm Jeeping here in the Four corners area and hope to not have engine heating problems. I have had these levels on 2 campers now, and they've worked great for both units.  The inches indicator appear to be accurate.  If it tells me I'm 3&#34; from level I add (2) 2x6 boards and I'm then level.  If it says I'm 1&#34; from level, then a 1x6 board makes it perfect.  These levels make it very simple to set your camper up properly...no guessing. Wouldn't allow accuracy to read numbers below 7lbs. My husband is lazy and i can't tell what the dog is saying...And i don't get an accurate reading from husband. 
I needed a durable and handy flexible tire gauge for checking pressure on my motorcycles. This gauge is very well built and give accurate readings. This holds my grease guns quite securely, but the angle of the handle you manipulate to get it to clamp and release the gun makes it awkward to use at times. Great tool for clamping hard to reach radiator hose clamps.  Its multi-position locking mechanism will make sure to clamp and hold various sized clamps- unlike other pliers that can only hold in the fully close position. 
You may have a tire pressure gauge, but this tool allows you to measure accurately when your tires need replacing.  It is durable and precise in its ability to measure the depth of your tire treads. The straight foot design and robust construction of this tire pressure gauge makes it THE choice for checking inside dual wheels! THIS IS THE PERFECT TIRE PRESSURE GAUGE FOR CHECKING TIRE PRESSURE ACCURATELY, QUICKLY AND EASILY.  SIMPLY PUT THE END OVER THE VALVE STEM, HOLD IT FIRMLY FOR A SECOND OR TWO AND READ THE PRESSURE.  THE GAUGE ON THE NEW TIRE PUMP IS NOT CORRECT AND NEITHER IS THE PRESSURE GAUGE ON THE ELECTRIC TIRE PUMP THAT ATTACHES TO THE CIGARETTE LIGHTER. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE ACCUTIRE MS DIGITAL TIRE PRESSURE GAUGE. 
Work's great for my trailer. Use these in trailer tires, car tires, truck tires, ANY tires-these have saved me several times on the road, pull the nail, install one or 2 of these, reinflate with a small portable (or my nitrogen tank if I'm in the service truck), back on the road. If you ride around the roads of south Florida then you need this product in your tires. You will not have a flat ever again if you follow the dirrections ! It works 
Made in China poor quality item that does not befit the Robert Bosch brand at all.Not for winter for sure.The origin of the product should be stated at the product page.If I knew it were a MADE-IN-CHINA I would not have bought it. Considering this is made in China, it is a quality product, too bad all my locks are keyed to the some number One question i have now that i read the bottom of the filter box saying "Made in Mexico"We all know "Made in China" means it was made good but with bad materials, so results can be OK or horrible depending on what it is, but how about filters ?Doing research i found that mexico's advantage could be the shipping price, but not much talk about quality of the assembly or material quality. 
Does what it says it does......looks great ! This meter should be used as a general indication of voltage only. I checked it against a calibrated professional meter and found it to be reading 4 volts high. This put the reading in the read area when in fact the voltage was acceptable. I will still use it on my generator and simply subtract 4 volts from the reading. Used this way it is marginally effective. These item does fit perfect on my 2004 BMW x3. does what its suppose to do. so far so good thanks 
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Though Amazon stated this cap would not fit my 2013 Ford E-450 chassis (for a Jayco, Class C, Greyhawk, RV), I ordered it anyway as it fits many other years of Ford trucks and looks the same. It is rare for the same vehcle to change a design like that. It, in fact, fits perfectly. Our RV gas filler has no cover (not that that is a deterrant) and 60 gallons is a target for remote theft of gas, or a target for vandalism. This cap fits well. I have not been able to fit the stock cap-retainer onto it yet. I understand these modern vehicles have anti siphon plugs but one can still end up with foreign substances in the exposed fill-tube. This is a good 'ounce of prevention'.Highly recommended. Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars 
This item fits great on my 2005 Subaru WRX STI.  My original plastic one was squealing like crazy.  This all metal pulley fixed that. They only fit around a standard thickness roll bar not the newer jeep arrangement with the plastic cover shroud of the late models. They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. 
Fits perfectly for my 2003 Toyota Camry, but the number of folds in the filter were fewer than the OEM one. It's short 10 folds compared to the Toyota OEM cabin air filter.

They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. 
Bought them with the cruiser plates and while they did fit the plates they did not fit the wholes on the car. Dont know why. Work fine on the front but not the rear. Also they are security screws, so do not lose the device that comes with them. FYI Works great. Fairly easy swap.

It's sturdy and fit's nice and snug in a standard 5 gallon bucket. I will be ordering more of these in the future. 
Fits my low clearance Mazda 5 that comes with alloy wheels and 3/4 inches of clearance between the inside of the tire and the suspension.  Have not tried it in the snow yet. They only fit around a standard thickness roll bar not the newer jeep arrangement with the plastic cover shroud of the late models. They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. 
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. I'm using these in my 2009 Civic sedan and have not had any problems. Fits like a glove and build is solid. Was a little worried about this fitting my Daytona Triumph 650 but it fit well, no issues. Would purchase again. 
These are typical hard plastic handles, contoured for grip. The stock bar is substantial at 7/16". Edges are finished nicely. The metal shaft is unpolished and has a finish to prevent slippage.I don't care if all my hand tools are the same color, if it matters to you then note these may come in a different color than illustrate (see my pics).Made in the U.S.A. - nice.j These are a good accessory to have because the clips are decent quality and the varied colors are helpful in keeping track of all the wires. These are great blades made by Anco.  They are beam style blades that hug your windshield.  They leave a streak free shine and are great in the rain.  They are easy to install and work great.  I can say these are comparable to the Bosch brand blades, and would recommend these highly.  5 stars. 
Like is the word and not love.For my 1998 shadow ace vt750c.Requires the original honda spark plug tool due to clearance issues.Improve fuel economy? Nah.Improved performance? Nah.If you find hard enough, their website rated this plugs good to go for 50 000 KM.The denso are better made and packaged. Have a smaller tip and a U groove electrode which can last 30 000KM. But since there is no difference in using a normal and iridium plug for my bike, mileage is more important.Only reason to use this is if your plugs are difficult to get to or you dread spark plug changes. As everyone else points out, this intake tube will make your engine sound louder during moderate to heavy acceleration, but that is simply because it eliminates the factory resonance chamber.  The minimum cross section is the same as your stock tube so its not capable of flowing any more air than stock.  It still has the sharp 90 degree turn to the throttle body that the OEM system has.  There may be some minor reduction of turbulance, but at most engine speeds, especially where the engine spends most of its time, it won't matter.  I've never seen an independent  dyno test published with a before and after with just this mod.  Clearly the postings on Airaid's site are BS.  If something this simple could increase HP and torque by 5% across the RPM band, it would be incorporated into your car from the factory.  I doubt there is any HP improvement but there might be 1 or 2 HP gain.  Not enough to feel and not enough to measure with a G-tech on 1/8 mile runs.  On my 5.3 there was zero improvement in mileage over 40K miles of driving compared to before.  This includes some 400 mile runs pulling a 6000lb trailer.  It does look better than the stock set up and it really makes your motor sound like it has more power.  If that does it for you, buy one - its well made and fits great.  If you want a few more HP, save your money for a DiabloSport Predator or similar.  Only negative with the tube is you need to loosen the clamp at the throttle body to service your stock air filter because the coupling is not as flexible as the original (it doesnt need to be). Measurements are repeatably consistent and seem to match other gauges I trust. However, this gauge results in more missed connections that end up leaking air than other gauges. 
I drilled a couple of holes into my toolbox and mounted this to the side of the toolbox.  now my grease gun is always handy and does not take up space in the toolbox. Fits well into the 7 pin socket and holds the 4 pin socket securely.  Works just like it's supposed to.  Nice adapter It does get a bit warm while providing the 5 amps of power to the Koolatron car cooler (which I took into hotel rooms at night), but it did exactly what it was supposed to do so can't complain. One issue: There are two different sizes for so-called "cigarette lighter" outlets. This has the "big" size, which means "small" size plugs can have issues. Solution if that is a problem for your particular plug is simply to use a toothpick to "shim" the small-size plug into the large-size socket. 
i use these for aftermarket batteries for 12v power wheels. can charge with a battery tender and fit together nicely This is a very nice charger for many batteries, BUT it states AGM (not good for many). An AGM 12VDC VMAX, or Optima type RV or marine battery requires a special charger that will deliver 25-35 Amps, not 8. This is for a very small AGM battery. This cost over $120 and I will use it for regular flooded lead batteries but must buy another for AGM or Gel batteries for my RV. A specialty battery requires a specialty charger, I found out. I do recommend this, would buy again, and I hope this helps. This is a factory replacement for a Honda Rincon. Easy to fill and charge, works great. Sealed battery and should last quite some time in conjunction with my Battery Tender Jr. 
Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. Inexpensive, yet works as good as the ones sold by Honda dealerships. Made true to specs and fits right into the slot on my Accord 2006.Will buy again. 
No issues, just as described.  Used to connect my motorcycle to Battery Tender charger.  Also connect to adapter to charge my cell phone. connected two of these cables to charge my battery on my truck / battery charger unit is in garage works perfect. works perfectly for my RC lipo charger at home letting me ditch the cheap charger that came iwith my heli. 
The Tender Jr. does not come with a cigarette adapter so I cut this in half to make two. I purchased 2 lighter plugs for a buck each from China&#8230; with free shipping&#8230; and they are working fine. These aren&#8217;t an exact match with the Tender cables but they fit together OK and are easy to determine polarity with the wire colors. You can also just use this as an extension cord for your Tender. The description states a length of 12-inches&#8230; but it&#8217;s actually 14-inches tip-to-tip on the connectors. Nice item for the price and it&#8217;s made in Mexico. please note these are not white - but beige... other than that they are standard rv baggage catches these are a great additional tool for leveling the front and sides of the camper when you are by ourself! They are large enough to see from a distance to keep things on the level 
Careful you don't drop the adapters when prying the package open (don't ask).  Product seems to fit well but time will tell. Hose was plenty long, sealed properly and didn't change the taste of the water. The seal came uninstalled on one of the tie wraps so don't forget to look for it and use it....it's the only one they provide and not an extra. Can't say whether this item works well or not.  Don't care for it.  Hasn't helped with emptying the black water in the RV so don't really understand what it is supposed to do. 
Fits my 2002 Silverado LS 5.3L vortec RWD, extended cab. Very simple install, DON'T remove the third bolt closest to the driver side of the under dash shield, you can move it out of the way without taking it all the way off, saving you a headache trying to line the cover back up again. Doesn't have a &#34;fresh breeze&#34; smell and I can still smell the dirty air of city driving, but still a HUGE upgrade from what I had in there. Basically a pile of dirt and leaves with some filter in the middle. Air flow is superb. This has a lot of uses beyond car applications. I used a sheet of it on the drywall behind in-wall speakers to cut the amount of sound radiating through the back wall and tighten the sound. I used a sheet of it inside a computer case, to eliminate a tinny rattle that came from the case vibration while it was on. You can even put pieces of it on the inside of washing machine or dryer panels to make them quieter.It does have one drawback, and that's the fact that once you stick it on something, you will not be able to get it off without making a big mess. It is essentially tar with a foil outer cover, and trying to get it off just leaves a bunch of sticky tar behind. So, choose the place you want it carefully before sticking it down!

The dash of my black car is anthracite gray, and it shows dust easily. The California duster is created for either exteriors or interiors of cars and is impregnated with paraffin wax. This picks up the dust and the soft fibers float over the uneven surfaces of the car interior, picking it all up in one swipe.I keep this in the car and once a week I swipe down the interior all over to keep the car sparkling clean. It's small enough to keep handy under the seat.This makes a really nice gift for someone to congratulate them on their new car, or for someone who likes doing their own detailing. I have always been a fan of handwashing my vehicles but over the years I have sometimes come across the problem of leaving small scratches or swirl marks on the surface due to dirt/grit staying on my wash mitt/sponge. After purchasing two grit guards for the 2 bucket wash method, I couldn't be happier!By simply running your wash materials over the guard, it loosens up the dirt and debris removed from your car, sending it right to the bottom of the bucket. This allows you to get a clean mitt every time and it keeps the dirt from landing back on your car.If you are a fan of washing your car and keeping it looking new like I am, I would suggest picking up a grit guard or two. Your car's finish will thank you for it! Claying your car is a very important step nowadays.  There is so much pollution in the air and it sits on the paint surface and often gets ground into the paint.  My car was brand new, but it sat on the car lot front line, next to a major Highway and major feeder street, so it had quite a bit of particles on it.  You could not see it, but you could feel it.  I used the clay kit by Meguiar's to remove all of the particles before I waxed my car.  The surface, after claying, was absolutely smooth and the wax went on easily. 
This is a great hose support as compared with the one I had before this. Not only does it have a carry handle that keeps it compact for storage, it has a deep enough area for the hose that the hose doesnt just slide right off the support like my old one. This one is also much stronger built and doesn't flip over on its side. Works great, easy to use, easy to store and well worth the money. It is a harden 2 inch trailer ball. Seems to be of decent quality. It was easy to mount and does the job. Material seems to be a bit thin but it does its job well.  It fits my VTX1300c with sissy bar perfectly. 
I was apprehensive because of the reviews with people saying theirs only worked once.. But I get the feeling that they didn't understand how the thing works. You can easily damage the components by using it wrong. You pump the thing 3-4 times per quart, but you don't want to sit and pump while you're removing the fluids, that isn't how it works. Pump it a 3-4 times and wait for it to get done, then do it again. It goes pretty fast! I did my brakes, trany, oil, power steering, transfer case, and differential before pulling the plug to get the rest and not make a mess and radiator fluid on a couple different vehicles.. went smoothly. I recommend buying a half inch hose clamp for the rubber reducer. The product works well but the bottle itself stopped working halfway through my second time using it. I like the Meguiar's products but don't like how you can't just unscrew the cap and pour it in a regular bottle. This filter drops right in and has carbon in the filter for filtration.  I looked up how to replace this filter online however the directions included show exactly how to replace it since it is behind the glove box.  It will only take about ten minutes.  Don't let the dealer charge you $35 for this job! 
I bought this steering wheel cover to hide the peeling leather on my 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited steering wheel. I measured the inside dimensions of the wheel, 15". I did not have to heat or stretch the new wheel cover, it fit perfectly and looks great. It's also much easier to keep clean with interior protectant. ...fits my 1973 Chevy/GMC 4x4 steering wheel perfect. Stretch it over the wheel and wrap the vinyl string around it nice and tight. The vinyl will break so just stretch it a little. I welded a piece of flat stock on the insert for the motorhome. This adapter is for my Dodge Grand Caravan. 
I've used this product many times in the past but each time I did it was the small bottle included with the filter that I used. This stuff is exactly the same as the smaller bottle and therefore works the same, which is to say very well. You spray it on the filter, let it sit for 10 minutes or so and rinse with water. There are two benefits to the larger bottle. First is that it is more economical. I have four vehicles with cotton oiled air filters and this bottle should last a fairly long time. Also, it is much easier to spray into the filter than with the smaller bottle. I also feel because it is easier to spray and direct you will use a little less cleaner your filter which should make it an even better value yet. I've done new spark plugs three times now on our vehicles and the anti-seize comes in handy. I've also used it to lubricate the threads on a basic strut compressor.A 4oz bottle would have been fine. This 8oz bottle will last my lifetime.Just mix it before each use because you get separation in the lubricant (similar to natural peanut butter). I saw an improvement in performance and sluggishness in my vehicle. If you've never used it and have high mileage, 2 applications are required. Also, it's important to first pour this and THEN the fuel. Ensure your tank holds at least 18 gallon, if you're using the 20 oz. or else go for the 12 oz. bottle. I would not recommend any additives other than this. These are really good and most importantly, don't cause any harm to the engine. 
I required an ammonia-free window cleaner for my tinted windows. This does the job quite nicely. It isn't how well it does, rather how safely it does it. Great for bikes. Not for cars. It doesn't hold much, but it's low enough and it's designed to have the capture cone on the corner, so you can fit it for bikes.Other than that, I can't imagine having this tiny thing for car oils. It works for both my bike and my car, because my car is tiny 4 banger and it doesn't hold too much oil. As advertised everything that this thing claims it can do it will. Also the packaging was nice, big but nice.
