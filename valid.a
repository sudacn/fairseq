The dash of my black car is anthracite gray, and it shows dust easily. The California duster is created for either exteriors or interiors of cars and is impregnated with paraffin wax. This picks up the dust and the soft fibers float over the uneven surfaces of the car interior, picking it all up in one swipe.I keep this in the car and once a week I swipe down the interior all over to keep the car sparkling clean. It's small enough to keep handy under the seat.This makes a really nice gift for someone to congratulate them on their new car, or for someone who likes doing their own detailing. This duster is very handy to clean up your car or truck. It is a fairly large wand that has treated fibers that attract and hold the dust so you can quickly clean your dash, seats and any surface in your vehicle. Dust sticks to the fibers so you are not just stirring up the dust you are collecting it.I like it because I don't have to spray any cleaner and wipe it all up.  This is much faster.  They say you should not wash it as it will remove the treatment from the fibers so I just shake the duster off when I am done.  I can't stand a dusty dirty car and I want to make it look nice and protect my investment.  This duster works quickly and doesn't scratch your car's interior.  The tapered and flat dusting wand even reaches into tight spaces like along the front of your dash against the front window.I like mine and use it all the time! These things slip on a hard painted concrete floor. Possibly OK on asphalt, but not concrete. Pass on them, get something else. 
Material seems to be a bit thin but it does its job well.  It fits my VTX1300c with sissy bar perfectly. It is a harden 2 inch trailer ball. Seems to be of decent quality. It was easy to mount and does the job. First things first...any protection this offers is purely incidental. You are fastening a metal grid to a plastic lens. Duh. But from a style standpoint, it does dress up the tail light assembly. One bar does pass right in front of theback up light which does diminsh its function. Installation is very simple. Directions are clear. The item is a bit pricey but the quality is good and the paint job good. It is a simple way to dress up your ride. 
If I wanted a SILVER colored horn like in the picture I supplied, I would have bought one of those. There are many of them for less than this.Fake! I am obviously upset.** UPDATE **: So, it is Dec 2012 and I am updating this. I found this exact same horn at the local auto parts store. It was black with the red stripe, and I bought it. Got home to swap out the horns and noticed the one I got on here was an FIAMM brand. So, I would guess whoever shipped me my stuff simply sent the wrong item. I never thought to check that it was the right brand, though.I have updated my star rating to 4. Can't find myself able to give it 5. When I ordered this, I was guaranteed fitment on a Toyota 3S-FE engine. When it arrived, it was not the correct size. i left two stars because I did run out and buy the correct size from another store, however, I didnt want to have to do this when I had all the rest of my parts shipped in. These were advertised as sold in a pair yet only one came.  I will need to order a second I guess.  They also appear plastic. 
I required an ammonia-free window cleaner for my tinted windows. This does the job quite nicely. It isn't how well it does, rather how safely it does it. Not to remove scratches, but to conceal and and make look presentable. It works well and does what it is supposed to do. Great for light scratches. Harder to use on black cars, but with a little patience it works well. It is a harden 2 inch trailer ball. Seems to be of decent quality. It was easy to mount and does the job. 
This is the best stuff on earth when you need to do a repair and cannot do a proper weld. It will also stick to most anything including plastics. It is strong and can be sanded, drilled, tapped, and machined once it is set up. A must for any shop or do-it-yourselfer. Permatex is the stuff my automotive junkies.  It will allow you to undo what you have done.  You do know that spark plugs come back out don't you?  Make sure the application is correct.  Some metal combinations will prefer nickel over copper based and so on. but for general use, this is the goop for you. If you have a high lift jack this is a must have.  You know you will need this in the worst of situations and this will provide better floatation in soft soil and sand. 
Lately, there seems no difference between polishing compound/rubbing compound. The latter used to refer to very coarse material but this no longer seems true.I use this compound mostly on plastics and it can remove residual adhesive, scratches, etc... It can also be used to polish clear coat layer on metallic paint. Paint whatever with metallic paint first, then spray a few layers of clear paint (gloss). Wait a day or two to completely dry and lightly polish with this compound & soft cloth. You'd be happy with the result. When researching what to do to make my car paint smooth as glass, I found this clay kit.  Works wonders, especially on weathered finishes.  Test your paint surface for roughness (everyone's has some) by putting your hand in a plastic baggie and wipe it over your car paint.  If it feels rough, which it should, then Meguiar's Clay Detailer is the cure!  Using the spray as a lubricant, the clay is rubbed along the paint surface removing bonded contaminants which cannot be removed by washing alone (tar, etc.).  I love it! This scratch remover seems to be more of a polish  and lube that will remove the surface scratches for the paint. It does not appear to have any &#34;grinding&#34; type ingredients in the paste.It will have little of no impact on deep scratches or deep nicks in the paint. It is easy to out on and remove and will a decent job for those light scratches. It did not remove any discoloring on my paint such as a stain left by a bird dropping. It ddi make the blemish lighter though. 
Not sure if ill buy it again, I bought t to use with my clay bars and for quick cleanups etc. I guess it does an OK Job, But Honestly I can do just as good with Water or a Quick Detail Spray Wax watered down. I wont buy it again. This is my second tool, the first one I had to modify the puller tang to work with chainsaw seals...i was going to buy the replacement tangs but they cost almost as much as the tool when you add in shipping so I just got a second one.  If you take your time and ensure the tang fits in the seal this tool is indispensable when replacing shaft type seals (camshaft, crankshaft etc).Love it. this is another requirement or should i say step to doing the job right, this glaze was exactly what i needed for my repair work, and will purchase this product again, love it. 
I have been using tape measures and the like for my car tires, but I didn't want to take a risk with my motorcycle tires.This tools is very simple to use.  Like others have mentioned, the grease can come off on your hands but that's ok.1/32 increments.I like that the gauge is a little wider so I can make sure it's level. Nothing works better than this when you don't have the time to do a complete detailing.  Ultimate Quick Detailer shines your car up to a wax like finish.This also works great if you are going to use a clay bar! When it comes to safe transportation, I try to take every preventive measures no matter how unlikely I will ever need it. First aid kits, flashlights, safety triangle, fire extinguisher, light reflecting outfit and finally this one, these make make up my doomsday inventory so far. Among them this may look to be the most extreme item but believe me people do get trapped in the car and unfortunately lose their lives just because they can not free themselves in time.I am afraid I don't have hands on experience about how this device works and I would never want such an experience, but just by writing the name resqme on youtube you will instantly see over 20 videos about that device. There you will see that it can really cut through the seat belt with one blow and somehow pulverize the window glass within seconds... So when you need it, if you can keep calm, it may take less than 30 second to get yourself out of the vehicle which would otherwise take minutes or not be possible at all.Due to great reviews and demonstrative videos, I purchased this item. I paid around $10 for a single one but sometimes there are bundles on amazon and you can buy a dual pack for $15.Although it is designed as key chain which is how you can keep it accessible on an operating car (provided that you don't have one of those new keyless devices) but like many other reviewers, I did not put it on my keychain. Although it is as small as it can be, still takes up some space in your keychain and feels bulky. Besides, since it has a built in blade, it may be misunderstood as a knife and put you some headache in airports and places like that. So, to me the best place to carry it is in the glovebox in a tiny case. But make sure that at no circumstance, it moves from where you put it and that you can access it easily from where you are trapped. This solution may not be ideal for some people and/or cars but then I advise you to look for a place that you can use for the purpose.I wholeheartedly recommend this product for anyone who values their life and wants to raise the safety level of their car trips and wish that you will never ever need to use it... 
Save your paint buy the door gards for your jeep the only thing I can say is make sure you clean the door jam first and make sure you have lined up and its easy if read the instruction don't just peel the cover off and try and stick it on you will miss place the guards where you want them then pull on the clear tape and the cove will come off then just push down These are good enough for visual rough-leveling of your camper, but they're no precion instrument.  It's tough to install these while holding them level and then sticking them down with the double-sided foam tape on the back side.  Once it's down it's down.  If you stick it on crooked, rip it off and throw it away and start over, or try to twist them level and then put in some screws to hold it there.  The foam tape will allow you to twist them back and forth. First thing's First -- DON'T USE THE BRUSH THEY GIVE YOU! It starts shedding and the hairs will get all over your calipers. Having used this before, I knew that ahead of time and was sure to use a standard painter's brush (thin and medium size).I went Black for my calipers so as to just clean them up. 2012 VW Jetta. I did light coats to start and then got the point I was just smearing the enamel on like icing to be sure I got full effect of what I wanted the results to be. It also helps to bake them with hair dryers after each coating to ensure it dries and adheres better.Always lay a trash bag and news paper below each target caliper otherwise the enamel will adhere to your garage floor or driveway. If it gets on your hands, just run them under hot water with Dawn and the enamel will turn into flakes and just come right off. The caliper cleaner may or may not be enough depending on the age of your car and how worn your calipers are, so be sure to buy another can if you feel you will need it. 
Looked exactly like the original in our Sienna. Denso is a large Japanese parts manufacturer and I expect these are the same filters without a Toyota box. It's much cheaper than the dealer price. These filters are of a better quality than stock, cost about the same or less than stock and are mudh easier to remove.  Even the feel between stock and these K & N's is noticable.  They use better quality cases, filter media and gaskets.  Highly recommend. Heavy duty chock and performed as expected. These were also $1-2 cheaper than any store in my area selling the same product. 
It fits fine on my 2012 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab.  I bought this and the stabilizer bar to keep my cooler(s) from trashing my truck bed.So EZ even a cavemen can use it!Ok, he might have a few cuts while trying!! 2013 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Sahara: Used this to extend a Bluetooth adapter to the glove box of my Jeep through the dash panels. Now my knee won't smash the Adapter and with the plug head being shorter I don't hit this either. Works just as I had planned. I tower out at 5'7&#34; which is not considered tall when it comes to working on or retrieving items from the bed of my 4x4 truck. This came in a nice carrying case that stores well behind the front seats in my truck without scratching anything. I have put on the front tire trying out the fit and it will work well . 
I returned because it is just too much work to install and I find it hard to believe they would make much difference. How can one really rate it, as it is used for protection and no idae how long it should last, yet is was as listed so I give it the benifit ogf the doubt... The bulb is kind of pricey but it is the brightest by how much? not as bright as the sun but when it comes to being seen on a bike...well what's your rear worth? 
First, as with all of the Dupli-Color Metalcast paints, if you want the metalcast effect, you'll have to use the Dupli-Color Metalcast Ground Coat (MC100) on the surface before you apply the color or it will not come out right. The can says that it also comes out the same if you're painting directly onto chrome like surface but I have not tried this so I don't know. Now for this green. I'm more of a blue and purple guy for dark colors so only by my personal preference do I say that this green comes out just a tad light in color for me. Overall though, if you use the ground coat this comes out great with a nice metal sheen. I recommend this product. Returned found better kit with colors that help match RV. You need kit with colors to match most applications. This kit is great! The LEDs are very bright at night and all the colors look good.The music pulse feature is lacking but I didn't expect much from it. 
It fits fine on my 2012 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab.  I bought this and the stabilizer bar to keep my cooler(s) from trashing my truck bed.So EZ even a cavemen can use it!Ok, he might have a few cuts while trying!! I use it everyday primarily for a storage cover.  I have not had the cover on the bike in rain or weather.  I got the XL for my CBR500R with full large rear bags and windshield.  I can lock my helmet to the rear seat area put the cover on and it will cover up the entire bikes exhaust and 3/4 of the rear tire and entire front tire.  Two bungies mid bike and front tire enable hokking cover under bike.  Very sturdy and breathable with exhaust panels (silver durable material) and inner windshield liner.  Much bang for the buck. Would certainly purchase another if I had to without question. I welded a piece of flat stock on the insert for the motorhome. This adapter is for my Dodge Grand Caravan. 
Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.  The pickle fork is the last resort for me, as it will damage the balljoint boot.I prefer to use the Snap On balljoint remover.  If that one cannot fit, then I will try this tool.  If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork. IT WORKS I haven't really used it yet for the reason intended, changing the oil in my jet ski.  So, I can't comment on how well it works.  The main reason for this review is to put it out there that it does not work with a 2000 Chevy Silverado.  The siphon tube does not fit thru the bottom of the dip stick tube.  It would be really nice if Mityvac had a published list of what vehicles it works with and what ones it does not.  I have my fingers crossed that it'll work with my jet ski, otherwise there will be a new/(un)used Mityvac on *****'slist.  Long story short, do your research to see if you can confirm or deny if it will work with your vehicle before you buy it. 
How do you rate these?  They do exactly what they are supposed to do.  What more can I say.  It don't stink no more?!  LOL have not in stalled this product yet but looks like it will do exactly what i need it to do. I'm sure this product will do what it needs to do.  It's difficult for this product to really screw up what it's intended purpose is.  I use it to put on spark plugs and wheel lug nuts so they don't seize up and become impossible to remove. 
I required an ammonia-free window cleaner for my tinted windows. This does the job quite nicely. It isn't how well it does, rather how safely it does it. Not to remove scratches, but to conceal and and make look presentable. It works well and does what it is supposed to do. Great for light scratches. Harder to use on black cars, but with a little patience it works well. works well 
this is another requirement or should i say step to doing the job right, this glaze was exactly what i needed for my repair work, and will purchase this product again, love it. This is my second tool, the first one I had to modify the puller tang to work with chainsaw seals...i was going to buy the replacement tangs but they cost almost as much as the tool when you add in shipping so I just got a second one.  If you take your time and ensure the tang fits in the seal this tool is indispensable when replacing shaft type seals (camshaft, crankshaft etc).Love it. I haven't had the need to install this yet but plan to this summer. I always use ACDelco parts when working on my GMC because I know I can't go wrong with genuine GM parts! I will update this review once I install it. Thanks Amazon for having ACDelco in stock when I need parts for my truck.EDIT: Installed this along with theACDelco 15-20676 Idler Pulleyfor my 2000 GMC Sierra 4x4. TIP: If working on a similar truck, make sure you remove the top half of the radiator shroud to make it easy to get to everyting. Install is pretty straight forward. 
This duster is very handy to clean up your car or truck. It is a fairly large wand that has treated fibers that attract and hold the dust so you can quickly clean your dash, seats and any surface in your vehicle.

If you work on dirty/greasy stuff, you need this.Gritty, to get the grunge out of your fingerprints/creases, doesn't smell odd, and it dissolves grease like you would not believe.  One cleaning, and you're likely done, even if your hands could double as pumpkin lube. (automotive reference) These work as advertised but don't do anything particularly special.  Best part is just tossing them out when you're done.  No lint, unlike paper towels, so it works great to leave your interior surfaces clean without residual lint that can look really bad or embarrassing.  This product just cleans without any oil or gloss left over so that's great too as I dislike having greasy finishes that can reflect badly in the sun.  Need to make sure you keep these stored indoors out of the sun else they could dry up on you.I would suggest buying these when they're discounted such as subscribe and save @ 20% to maximize your savings. 
I ordered 2 different chargers to maintain my gate opener's deep cycle battery (a simple 4 output charger with extension cords for charging other deep cycle batteries from amazonBattery Tender 022-0148-DL-WH 12V 4-Bank Battery Management System) and this unit has a far superior charging design.The 4 bank battery tender does a simple fast rate charge then switches to a trickle charge at a constant voltage with 4 outputs.This unit pulses the battery under charge and features 3 operating modes with different current outputs for different sized batteries. The selections are motorcycle which also works well for SLA gel cells or AGM batteries, standard automotive starting battery, deep cycle batttery, and off.What makes the CTEK unit special is that it uses a pulse charge in all modes to attempt to desulphate batteries, while the battery tender does not.  This method of charging has proven successful in restoring lead acid batteries that won't take a charge any more.It comes with a waterproof 12V output cable and a set of clips or rings for permanent installation under the hood of your car.  In addition to the LEDs for indicating the type of battery being charged, a second set is provided for empty, 1/2 full, and maintenance pulse charge mode.There is also a noticable increase in quality between the battery tender and this unit - small details like a water sealed housing and gaskets on the connectors indicate quality in manufacture.For a single 12V lead chemistry battery this is a useful, well made tool. The Battery Tender Junior 12V Charger comes complete with everything needed to charge your 12V battery.  I purchased this model to specifically charge my motorcycle battery and I am pleased to say that the unit works great.  It is a very compact charger and is supplied with several attachments to ensure that your battery is kept in an optimum condition.I made the permanent hard wire attachment to my battery using the color coded leads connected directly to the appropriate positive & negative terminals on the battery. The opposite female end has an end cap which can cover the inlet when not in use. When I know that I will not be hitting the road for an extended period of time, I simply plug the unit in to maintain my existing battery's power supply.Battery Tender makes larger charging units, but this battery charger is great for charging everything from batteries for ATV's and motorcycles to scooters and lawn mowers. Because of it's very discreet size it does not take up any needed space. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to protect their battery investment and do not want to compromise space and versatility. I got a power plug to power plug style &#34;jumper&#34; device for my daughter, in case the 12V battery on her Prius dies.  Since the Prius doesn't use the 12V battery to start the motor, she doesn't need real jumper cables.  However, it's a keyless ignition, so she will not be able to jump power plug to power plug.  The battery on the Prius is has small terminals, so these are a nice size and should do the job of getting power from someone else's light to her battery. 
The handle could be a tad shorter, and the weight could have been reduced a little. It feels rather heavy and unwieldy to use, and it would have been better if the scraper were on the opposite side of the brush. The brush bristles are plentiful and stiff, making short work of most types of snow.Overall: 4/5 stars, decent price although could be less expensive and lighter in weight. The scraper is sturdy so far, and bristles work well in clearing snow. I wouldn't mind it if it were a few inches shorter. a regular 32mm socket will not fit in the space of my equinox. this is a kind of shorter 32mm socket designed only for oil filter cap job. it works fine. I needed this item for an air compressor that draws 15A, and my 12V socket can only handle 10A.  This item is perfect, and small enough to fit in my air compressor's case.  It would be nice if we know how many amps it could handle, but the wire gauge provided is more than enough for my 15A need. 
For occasional use, this is a perfectly-sized tube.  If you need this for a shop, look for larger packages.Does what it needs to do.  Simple to apply, evenly and lightly coat the threads, and works well. Use this for oil changes on my Subaru BRZ and it works great. Just stick the extension that has a smaller tube size right into the dip stick tube. Overall this is a pretty nice little unit.  It is compact, shipped in a compact box and the overall product quality is good. Product comes with an easily removable vacuum pump, solid plastic collection ball, collection tube of larger diameter tubing that connects to a smaller diameter tube that looks to be wire reinforced plastic covered tubing that easily should fit in most dipstick tubes. Tubes were long enough so I could sit the unit on the floor and have plenty of tube to insert down the dipstick tube.  Very easy to set up and use and the included red funnel makes it very easy and neat to pour the waste into a container for recycle.  The pump, funnel and the tube simply push onto the ball which has rubber type attachments.  I put a little oil on the o-ring under the top rubber piece to help improve the seal.  I bought this to change engine oil for a car that uses 7 liters of 5w-30 synthetic oil.  I ran the engine to heat up the oil some before I started the removal.  The system worked and got just about all of the oil out of the engine through the dipstick.  BUT, it took 4 hours to extract the oil.  The oil moves very slowly through the 1/8&#34; diameter or so tube that is inserted into the dipstick.  With the viscosity of the oil, the small diameter of the tubing and the limited amount of vacuum you can create - you can expect anywhere from 1/2 hour to 1 hour per quart. I tried this with some lighter viscosity fluids and it works really good.  This will be good for the snowblower, generator and other small oil volume units I have.  If you have time this is a nice item.  If you want it done quick this will not be your best option. 
I need this pump for every 100k miles when I change differential oil. There are two holes: bottom one is for oil drain and the top bolt is for oil fill. I use this pump to pump Gear oil using the top fill hole up to the point that oil will sip out. I don't think I can do it without this pump. I changed out all my rear diff fluid with this Lucas oil. I mean, its just diff oil, but with lucas, you cant go wrong: synthetic 75w140 for all temps, limited slip friction modifiers already in there, this is erfect use for those who want to do this, and not change it again in a long time.only con, the one gallon jug is kinda hard to use to fill the small fill hole without a funnel, alternaively, you can get 4 of those 1 quart squirt bottles and it would be easier. For less than 5 bones delivered on Prime this does the job. No problems with the lid staying tight on mine.I was asked why not just recycle using the 5-qt jug the oil came in? I do, but that's not enough. First of all I sometimes recyle ATF that comes only in 1qt bottles. Refilling those is a pain! Second I usually have 1 quart left over in the 5-qt oil jugs. I can combine these, once I have two, but then... I need to keep at least one of these available to measure removed ATF, since checking ATF levels are not trivial on most modern vehicles (warm-up, cycle through gears, etc.) Third, lawn mowers are filled from a jug but use only a quart or two, so that used oil has to go somewhere. It might be 3 seasons of mowing before the source jug becomes available.Pro tip: Build a 2x4 stand with a big funnel on top and a clamp above that. Put this jug on the base, clip your drain pan above the funnel and leave your oil bottle and filter inside the funnel and let it all drain for a day or two. That way you'll keep oil out of the dump and throw away cleaner empties. With a quick wipe you can also use it to combine jugs of clean left-over oil. 
The &#34;Battery Tender 021-0128 Battery Tender Plus 12V Battery Charger&#34; is a best buy.  It does everything they say it will do.  The add for it is not over blown and it did bring my battery back to life.  I am really glad I got it; I tried to use this to recondition a 12v small UPC battery thats been dead for 2 year. It didnt work. This product cant perform micracles. If a battery has been dead for too long, dont expect this to turn it to new. What i find that it does do is keep my good batteries operating like new much longer. I periodically condition/charge my emergency vehicle jumpstarter and i condition my UPC batteries when they just begin to give issues. Fit the application perfectly, and the car started without hesitation on the first crank.  I would recommend however that you look into the Optima website directly to purchase batteries, as they have an offer that extends their standard warranty when you purchase one of their chargers as part of the battery purchase.  You can't get the warranty if you do not purchase them together.  I'm not sure, but it does make sense that if you purchase this battery or any others in their line and you do purchase a charger in the same transaction they would probably honor the warranty extension, but I would check with them first.  The bottom line however, is that these batteries are so well made that they will probably outlast a standard battery 5 times over, so what's the logical point to extend the warranty to two years to begin with.  They're just trying to sell chargers and giving you the incentive by upping the warranty.  I'm certain the battery will far outlast that 2 year warranty.  As with all batteries, you should invest in a good smart battery charger rather than something cheap from Harbor Freight. 
Works as intended, easy to plug in and charge the motorcycle batteries.I double checked with volt meter at the end of charging and was at proper voltage I ordered 2 different chargers to maintain my gate opener's deep cycle battery (a simple 4 output charger with extension cords for charging other deep cycle batteries from amazonBattery Tender 022-0148-DL-WH 12V 4-Bank Battery Management System) and this unit has a far superior charging design.The 4 bank battery tender does a simple fast rate charge then switches to a trickle charge at a constant voltage with 4 outputs.This unit pulses the battery under charge and features 3 operating modes with different current outputs for different sized batteries.

I see a lot of negative reviews for this charger that I think are partially due to Amazon's incorrect description and the fact that most people don't know what size or type of charger they need. (including myself)I am a practicing Electronic engineer with more than 20yrs experience. I did not know much about battery chargers until recently researching what a good battery charger should do.1) this charger only delivers a max of 1.5A. This means if you try to charge a discharged auto battery (48AH) it will take a long long time. This charger does work great for topping off a car battery at 70% (12.4V).2) The instructions included clearly state the charger will automatically shut-off after 12 hours of charging. The charger will restart and continue charging if you unplug and then plug the charger in again. Best to get a higher capacity charger.3) This charger does have a float mode sort of. Actually it shuts off the charging current and monitors battery voltage. When the battery voltage drops low enough the charger cycles on to top it off and then shuts off again.MY SUMMARY 1st:I like this charger and think it does a good job for the PRICE. Gold box special was $15.20 + tax. (I would definitely buy it at the regular price for $3$)It's basically automatic. Don't have to set the voltage and it won't damage anything if you reverse the clips accidently. Compact size and reasonable quality clamps.This charger does what it is designed for. That is charge small batteries and top off larger automotive batteries. This is an excellent maintenance charger for all batteries to keep them fully charged when not in use. (My opinion)Personally I would not leave any charger connected to my battery for more than 24 hours. Now I use a cheap mechanical timer that is set to turn on for 1 hour every 24 hours. I would prefer a timer that I can set to turn on twice a week for a few hours.The charger is small feels solidly built with heavy plastic. It gets very warm aftercharging at 1.5A but not warm enough to be concerned. (no cooling fan)I gave this charger 5 stars because PRICE and performance is very good. Build quality is good as well.AMAZON DESCRIPTION (Poor): is incorrect in that this charger is not intended to be used to charge a LOW (discharged) car battery. The chart in the DESCRIPTION that shows the charging times is different than the manual.. The included MANUAL has a chart that states this charger should only be used as a "top off" or maintenance charger for auto batteries. In addition the charger in charging mode automatically shuts off after 12 hours of charging. (A good safety feature in my opinion.)Charging details:I discharged a car/truck jump start battery pack to 12.45V or approx 75% charge.(Typical full charge is 12.65V to 12.7V. To discharge the battery I used a battery/alternator tester. I have a voltmeter attached to charger and a current meter in series with battery and battery charger negative terminal.1) At the start of the charge, the charge current was 0.78A and then jumped to 1.52A in a few minutes.2) After 1 hour the charge current is 1.47A. Charge voltage is 13.0V.3) After 2 hours the charge current is 1.48A. Charge voltage is 13.25V.4) After 3 hours the charge current is 1.43A. Charge voltage is 13.46V.5) After 4 hours the charge current is 1.40A. Charge voltage is 13.82V.Note: that the charge current is decreasing as the battery is approaching full charge. This design feature will prevent overheating and extend the life of your battery.6) After 5 hours the charge current is 0.68A. Charge voltage is 14.71V.7) After 5.5 hours the charge current is 0.35A. Charge voltage is 14.67V.8) After 6 hours the charge current is 0.29A. Charge voltage is 14.73V.9) After 6.5 hours the charge current is 0.24A. Charge voltage is 14.72V.10) After 8.5 hours the charge current is 0.20A. Charge voltage is 14.73V.11) After 10.5 hours the charge current is 0.15A. Charge voltage is 14.71V.12) After 11.5 hours the charge is COMPLETE and the charge current has dropped to 0.0A. BATTERY voltage is 13.55V and declining. Charger is in the monitor mode. In monitor mode the charger AC power is 3W measured with a Belkin Watt meter.Almost 12 hours seems like a long time to charge a battery and this isn't even a full capacity car battery. But, it did a good job of gently charging the battery especially when it was near full charge. The important thing to me is the charging current declined as the battery neared full charge. This prevents overcharging and truly tops off the battery to maximum capacity.I tested the battery the next day with a battery tester and it passed well within the "good battery" full charge limits. The results were much better than the charger that came with the battery pack where it tested NEAR "weak".Very happy with the purchase. I would buy this exact model again. Should there be any problem(s) in the future I will update this review.Ships from and sold by Amazon. 
I installed this brake controller in a 1955 GMC pickup truck that I use for towing. Just follow the diagram for wiring and it just works like a breeze. I like the way you can adjust easily the voltage with the dial on the left and the mounts provided allows you to install it a convenient location under the dash (it works in any position).If you want to install this in a more modern truck without tapping directly into the wires, you will need additional adapters at extra cost. If your working with spark plugs you need this. As standard as they come and guaranteed to work.  Helped me gap my plugs with no problems. If you don't know how to use, just youtube it. Every person that changes their own oil needs one of these. It is a perfect fit.Simply attach a 15/16 socket to your torque wrench, attach this filter to the socket, and the rest is just as easy as can be. Perfect 
This is the review I did when these filters were sold in "packs of 2" There are some mistakes which i will highlight in brackets.These filters (PL20195) were bought as a replacement for the Toyota filters that are found on the 2.5L D-4D diesel engine in the Toyota Hilux pickup truck. They are of a very high quality as judged by the sealing gasket, the anti-drain back valve and its weight.Filter is being used with Mobil 1 Delvac 15W-40 (edit: it was actually 5W-40) Fully Synthetic engine oil and the engine noise has certainly reduced from its previous dino based lubricant.In my country, the Toyota dealership(TTTL) charges about US$28 for one filter; purchasing online and having the filters shipped cost me about US$13 for one.I highly recommend this filter as a high quality replacement that doesn't break the bank or if you plan to extend oil drain intervals.Now the technical stuff for people that want to know:PL20195 = PL20064 minus the pressure relief bypass valve (exactly the same dimensions)PL20195 is a longer version of the PL10241PL20064 is a longer version of the PL10028 (edit: the PL10028 doesn't have an antidrainback valve)The larger the filter usually means:1)that it takes longer for the oil pump to fill it.2)that there is more filter medium to trap more contaminants out of your oil3)that the oil will pass through the filter medium slower4)theoretically that a higher RPM will be required to activate the filter bypass valve (which means that you can rev your engine slightly higher without the oil bypassing the filter medium) - this really depends on the PSI that the pressure relief valve was designed with, but if a small filter and a larger filter have the same PSI value for the "relief" then this theory should hold true.Today the filter is currently being used with Shell Rimula R4 15W-40 for 8000Km oil change intervals This product fit perfectly on the oil filter cover on my 2011 Lexus RCX350  . This one works great, and makes changing oil a breeze.  Make sure you use synthetic 0W20, get an OEM filter element, proper plastic drain plug, and your ready to change your oil in less than 20 minutes.  On a Lexus, you will save at least $150 (after buying the oil and needed parts/tools). For occasional use, this is a perfectly-sized tube.  If you need this for a shop, look for larger packages.Does what it needs to do.  Simple to apply, evenly and lightly coat the threads, and works well. 
This was a bit loose on my grease gun, and a bit awkward to get fastened. An OK product, not exciting but serviceable. It does allow hanging the grease gun with some placement precision. The kit makes cleaning the K&N filters so much easier and cuts through the grease and grime better then average soaps without leaving a residue behind. It filters oil and comes with the gasket and crush washer you need to change the oil 
Well, this is a filter... not very flashy but comes with a nice cap unlike my local parts store that wanted $1 more and did not include the cap. it looks well build. As good as the factory original. Thanks for the tip from one of the other reviewers to drill a small hole in the top of the cap in order to attach the existing leash. (It doesn't come with one) After observing that my Radio Shack test leads don't conduct electricity very well, I decided to upgrade to this set. Generally I have been happy with my purchase but the large number of small parts is a concern. Extech provides tiny dust caps for many of the conductive surfaces, which should improve their longevity. While these are a nice touch, they are likely to get lost.  Additionally, the base cables are separate from the probes and clips, creating 12 separate parts.  Adding the slim reach test probes, which would be purchased separately, there will be a total of 14 items in the case.It would take a longer time period to truly evaluate this product as the corrosion resistance of the surfaces along with the durability of the PVC cables will be the key indicators of value. Meanwhile, the cables and probes appear to be well made.  As some of the other reviewers have mentioned, the flared design of the main probes can be less than ideal in tight spaces.  So, you might want to consider purchasing the Extech TL743 Slim Reach Test Probe Set at the same time.  Note the term "set" in the case of the slim reach test probe set is a bit misleading because there are only two probes without case or cables.  They will fit nicely in the existing case.The Extech TL809 Electronic Test Lead Kit is a solid value.  There is some room for improvement, such as integrated caps, but this would most likely come with an increase in expense and some additional limitations.  For no additional expense, Extech should include the slim leads in the base kit and make the flared probes optional.  At this price point, this lead set is highly recommended.ProsNice carrying caseComes with probes, alligator clips and plunger mini-hooksDust caps on conductor surfacesConsToo many small partsFlared test probes too wide for some applications 
I purchased this to be able to attach a high-end hydraulic assisted bike rake on the back of my Jeeps (JKs) with the rear tire still on.  It fit perfectly and teamed with the Bolt Lock BLT7018448 5/8'' Receiver Lock (Keyed specifically for your line of vehicle) it can be kept in the Jeep and my daughter doesn't need anything but her car key.The extender is exactly as advertised, well made, fit perfectly and does eactly what it is inteded for. These Cruiser Accessories 81330 Locking Fasteners, Import-Stainless are exactly what I needed to mount my plate securely to my truck.  Though I ordered them for my car, it had no plate mount to use them on and I couldn't get up behind the plastic bumper to back up the screws with the locking nuts.  Nuts! Very strong and adjustable cup-holder.  I bought two of themm, skrewed them onto the RV walls...one for the driver and one for the passenger. 
We use these to put color logos on the inside of the plate for display on the front of the vehicle. Back ground can be painted in on the inside of the plate for better contrast. They look great holding my skull license plate frame.  Gives the license plate frame a more hardened, chrome look.  Great product. I just ordered a custom painted front plate for my truck and wanted to protect it from dirt and fading. This cover fits the bill just right. Easy install over the plate and clear view is not a problem. I highly recommend this product. 
This seems to be one of the better levelers. There are two different scales on these levels. One is for the side-to-side (back of the coach) and the other is for the front-to-back (side of the coach). The reason there are different scales are they are more-or-less calibrated in inches.For example, it is simple Trigonometry to determine how many inches the coach is out of level simply by using the formula for right-angles and solve for one side. The input values are the angle (determined by the level) and distance from the level to the point at where you want to know how many inches of lift are needed.For the side-to-side level, the 1&#34; markings are pretty accurate as long as you put the scale in the center of the coach, as most coaches are within an inch or two of width from another.  However, for the front-to-back level, even though you put the scale in the center, the result will vary wildly due to the length of the coach. Using this level on a 18ft coach will result in a far different measurement than say a 35ft coach.Also, if you don't put the level in the center (in the side or back), then the two ends of the coach will be different. For example, if the level is in the center, then when the level measures 1&#34; off level, that means 1&#34; on either front or back. But if you put the level off-center, then the level reading 1&#34; might truly be 1/2&#34; on one end, and 1 1/2&#34; on the other. Again, it is simply a principle of Right Angles in Trigonometry.Also, do not rely on the self-adhesive backing as over time it can move. As hard as it may be for you to do, drilling a couple holes and inserting screws into the levels is the best bet. This is everything you need in a tread depth gauge, and nothing you don't. Here's how you use it: You press the &#34;probe&#34; down into the tread gap to measure the depth. You then rotate the cylinder around to match the exact mark to the line. The measurements are on four sides of the cylinder, making them easier to read than being stacked on top of one another. Being able to rotate the cylinder makes it much easier to measure something as minute as 1/32 of an inch. The pair of levels are a great value.  I recently purchased these for a second time, as the originals were sold with my previous trailer and I wanted to make my new trailer easier to get on a level stance.There really isn't much to go wrong as far as product failure is concerned.  Accuracy is up to you with the initial installation.Recommended method of installation is to get your trailer level/RV, front to back, and side to side.  Once you have your trailer true, install the graduated levels in locations which will show you front to back level (placed on the side of the trailer) and side to side (place on the front or back of the trailer).  Make sure the bubble indicates "level" by being in the center point of the tube.Installation should be done once all your components are "stressed" as they will be for trailer/RV use (I.E. front tongue on a travel trailer, all the normal weight sitting on the winch foot, or in the case of 5th wheels/motorcoaches, landing gear down), try to place the levels on the RV in clear view of the winch/landing gear controls to enable leveling without having to relocate to a different location to view the levels.I accomplished this on a travel trailer by placing one level on the very front center, and the other on the side of the frame tongue close to the winch.  Though small, with sharp eye-sight, you can take advantage of the one on the front of the trailer as you position the trailer to see if you can establish a level side to side stance as you near your desired location.On my 5th wheel, my landing gear controls are on the front corner of the main body.  I placed one on the side of the rig for front to back level, and another right around the corner on the front side (for side to side level) still within sight of the controls, as well as from the truck cab for backing up.  Even though the level is off center, if it is installed properly with the trailer level at the time of installation, it will work fine.As far as the graduated scales are concerned, you will have to find your "scale" for adjustments, as it depends on where the levels are placed in reference to the center of the pivot points.The levels come with a self adhesive foam strip on the back for placement as well as two holes for screws if you wish to drill holes in the side of your rig.  I go with the adhesive strip route, as I don't like unnecessary holes.  The only negative with the adhesive strips is they will flex if stressed and it can put the levels off level, though this only happened to me with the first pair after the foam tape aged a few years.One last comment . . .the green bubble tube will fade from extended UV exposure.  It will not interfere with the accuracy, just makes it a little harder to read.If you are looking for larger levels which can be read from a distance, I know they are out there, but I have no experience with them to make a comparison.  I do not wish to clutter the appearance of the rig with large levels. 
I got it quickly it looks good can not wait to use it as soon as I can go out side . It works.  That's all you can ask.  We no longer run into the junk that we have in the front of the garage I have found few RV camp sites to be level. I have also tried to level my travel trailer by eyeballing the way it looks when I park it. That never works out well. I always feel like the trailer is leaning when I walk around in it.With this bullseye level, I can place it on the trailer tongue or on the trailer floor as I do my leveling. I can quickly do the leveling with confidence. When I am done, I slip the bullseye in a drawer where it will be safe for my next trek. 
They look great holding my skull license plate frame.  Gives the license plate frame a more hardened, chrome look.  Great product. We use these to put color logos on the inside of the plate for display on the front of the vehicle. Back ground can be painted in on the inside of the plate for better contrast. THIS IS A STURDY AND INEXPENSIVE LICENSE PLATE HOLDER THAT ALLOWS FOR THE PLATE TO SIT ON THE EDGE OF THE HOLDER BECAUSE OF IT'S DESIGN.  GOOD PRODUCT. 
This is my second time for ordering this filter.  I was being charged about $20 at the oil change place for the same thing.  It is easy to get at, behind the glove box, and now takes less than a minute to change. There are videos on UTube. I recommend this as functionally the same as original, the least expensive I have found, and by a Prime seller. i have been using these filters on my bike that i occasionaly take to the track i do about 4000 miles a month and i can say this really is a better filter. Much better than the OEM plastic idler pulley. Only time will tell if this will last any longer than the OEM unit, but I'm pretty sure it will. Pain in the butt to replace - but if yours is making noise, you'd better replace it soon. I've read too many horror stories about the idler pulley seizing up, and being thrown through the timing cover, damaging the timing belt. 
I purchased this neat voltage meter (that's really what it is) a couple of years ago to keep track of the RV's battery voltage.  I checked it against a $300+ Fluke multi-meter I use at work.  They were within 1/10th of a volt of each other.  10 stars for accuracy.  I tapped into a 12 VDC circuit and  installed a 12 volt outlet in my Cougar Travel Trailer so that I could monitor the voltage at all times.  This meter has been plugged in there for two years now and is working flawlessly.  Highly recommend this unit if you want to keep track of the battery voltage and the voltage the RV's power converter is putting out.Update 9/6/2013:  Three years now in almost constant use.  Working just fine. I currently own 6 12 volt models of this charger and have had no issues after numerous years of use.  Recently bought a Honda CT90 which is a 6 volt system.  The only way to keep the battery at full charge over extended periods is a good reliable trickle charger.  I had to go with the best so a new Battery Tender Junior was the ticket. got this unit in Dec and plugged it into the batteries on two motorcycles.  after two days, the green lite came on and has been on since.  the batteries seem to be charged correctly. 
Does exactly what it is supposed to and you can use it without having to run around the vehicle to turn the water on and off. Always make sure you measure your plugs before install, this tool will do it for you do it yourselfers, thanks!! It does exactly what it's supposed to do. No problems whatsoever. 
This is a tandem wheel changers dream, is well made, very easy to use, and fast shipping with Prime. Simply drive up or back onto the good tire/wheel very slowly with one foot on the brake and have spotting assistance. The base has multi-type grips for any surface and does not slide. If you overshoot it just keep going and re-position it, try again and go slower. Do not stop as it decends the back side as you can not go back-up the steep side, or move the unit with weight on it. Mine is a 24' trailer. Highly recommend item. Don't leave home in a tandem wheeled RV without one of these onboard; that is when you are bound to get a flat. This make a foul job very easy. I can lift my hood now and it doesn't fall back down. They were very easy to install and now the hood lifts like new. This just slides on the handle and lift bar to eliminate rattling while driving with a hi lift jack. It's cheap and easy, what more do you want? 
connected two of these cables to charge my battery on my truck / battery charger unit is in garage works perfect. The Battery Tender Junior 12V Charger comes complete with everything needed to charge your 12V battery.  I purchased this model to specifically charge my motorcycle battery and I am pleased to say that the unit works great.  It is a very compact charger and is supplied with several attachments to ensure that your battery is kept in an optimum condition.I made the permanent hard wire attachment to my battery using the color coded leads connected directly to the appropriate positive & negative terminals on the battery. The opposite female end has an end cap which can cover the inlet when not in use. When I know that I will not be hitting the road for an extended period of time, I simply plug the unit in to maintain my existing battery's power supply.Battery Tender makes larger charging units, but this battery charger is great for charging everything from batteries for ATV's and motorcycles to scooters and lawn mowers. Because of it's very discreet size it does not take up any needed space. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to protect their battery investment and do not want to compromise space and versatility. I see a lot of negative reviews for this charger that I think are partially due to Amazon's incorrect description and the fact that most people don't know what size or type of charger they need. (including myself)I am a practicing Electronic engineer with more than 20yrs experience. I did not know much about battery chargers until recently researching what a good battery charger should do.1) this charger only delivers a max of 1.5A. This means if you try to charge a discharged auto battery (48AH) it will take a long long time. This charger does work great for topping off a car battery at 70% (12.4V).2) The instructions included clearly state the charger will automatically shut-off after 12 hours of charging. The charger will restart and continue charging if you unplug and then plug the charger in again. Best to get a higher capacity charger.3) This charger does have a float mode sort of. Actually it shuts off the charging current and monitors battery voltage. When the battery voltage drops low enough the charger cycles on to top it off and then shuts off again.MY SUMMARY 1st:I like this charger and think it does a good job for the PRICE. Gold box special was $15.20 + tax. (I would definitely buy it at the regular price for $3$)It's basically automatic. Don't have to set the voltage and it won't damage anything if you reverse the clips accidently. Compact size and reasonable quality clamps.This charger does what it is designed for. That is charge small batteries and top off larger automotive batteries. This is an excellent maintenance charger for all batteries to keep them fully charged when not in use. (My opinion)Personally I would not leave any charger connected to my battery for more than 24 hours. Now I use a cheap mechanical timer that is set to turn on for 1 hour every 24 hours. I would prefer a timer that I can set to turn on twice a week for a few hours.The charger is small feels solidly built with heavy plastic. It gets very warm aftercharging at 1.5A but not warm enough to be concerned. (no cooling fan)I gave this charger 5 stars because PRICE and performance is very good. Build quality is good as well.AMAZON DESCRIPTION (Poor): is incorrect in that this charger is not intended to be used to charge a LOW (discharged) car battery. The chart in the DESCRIPTION that shows the charging times is different than the manual.. The included MANUAL has a chart that states this charger should only be used as a "top off" or maintenance charger for auto batteries. In addition the charger in charging mode automatically shuts off after 12 hours of charging. (A good safety feature in my opinion.)Charging details:I discharged a car/truck jump start battery pack to 12.45V or approx 75% charge.(Typical full charge is 12.65V to 12.7V. To discharge the battery I used a battery/alternator tester.

Charge voltage is 13.0V.3) After 2 hours the charge current is 1.48A. Charge voltage is 13.25V.4) After 3 hours the charge current is 1.43A.

Charge voltage is 14.67V.8) After 6 hours the charge current is 0.29A. Charge voltage is 14.73V.9) After 6.5 hours the charge current is 0.24A. Charge voltage is 14.72V.10) After 8.5 hours the charge current is 0.20A. Charge voltage is 14.73V.11) After 10.5 hours the charge current is 0.15A. Charge voltage is 14.71V.12) After 11.5 hours the charge is COMPLETE and the charge current has dropped to 0.0A. BATTERY voltage is 13.55V and declining. Charger is in the monitor mode. In monitor mode the charger AC power is 3W measured with a Belkin Watt meter.Almost 12 hours seems like a long time to charge a battery and this isn't even a full capacity car battery. But, it did a good job of gently charging the battery especially when it was near full charge. The important thing to me is the charging current declined as the battery neared full charge. This prevents overcharging and truly tops off the battery to maximum capacity.I tested the battery the next day with a battery tester and it passed well within the "good battery" full charge limits. The results were much better than the charger that came with the battery pack where it tested NEAR "weak".Very happy with the purchase. I would buy this exact model again. Should there be any problem(s) in the future I will update this review.Ships from and sold by Amazon. 
I've had good luck with this charger.  I use it to charge a standard starter battery and two Optima blue top deep cycle batteries on my aluminum bass boat.  The charger has settings for standard, agm, and gel batteries as well as 15amp, 10 amp and 2 amp charging rates.  Adjust the charging rate to the size of the battery being charged.  Charger also displays voltage of battery or percent of charge reading at your option.  Auto shut off and displays a green light when fully charged. All charging is done in my garage.  The charger is stored there as well, out of the elements.  I've had no problems in the two years I've owned it.  Maintain your batteries during times of inactivity by charging at least monthly and they'll start your outboard when it's time to fish.  A very good charger for the money spent. I ordered 2 different chargers to maintain my gate opener's deep cycle battery (a simple 4 output charger with extension cords for charging other deep cycle batteries from amazonBattery Tender 022-0148-DL-WH 12V 4-Bank Battery Management System) and this unit has a far superior charging design.The 4 bank battery tender does a simple fast rate charge then switches to a trickle charge at a constant voltage with 4 outputs.This unit pulses the battery under charge and features 3 operating modes with different current outputs for different sized batteries. The selections are motorcycle which also works well for SLA gel cells or AGM batteries, standard automotive starting battery, deep cycle batttery, and off.What makes the CTEK unit special is that it uses a pulse charge in all modes to attempt to desulphate batteries, while the battery tender does not.  This method of charging has proven successful in restoring lead acid batteries that won't take a charge any more.It comes with a waterproof 12V output cable and a set of clips or rings for permanent installation under the hood of your car.  In addition to the LEDs for indicating the type of battery being charged, a second set is provided for empty, 1/2 full, and maintenance pulse charge mode.There is also a noticable increase in quality between the battery tender and this unit - small details like a water sealed housing and gaskets on the connectors indicate quality in manufacture.For a single 12V lead chemistry battery this is a useful, well made tool. This is a great little charger unit.  It is not actually a battery maintainer like some of the real expensive units out there.  I have a &#34;BatteryMinder Unit&#34; which is a real maintainer but at 5 times the cost too! ($85)  This will charge a battery, and will float the charge at a very low rate of charge input to &#34;maintain&#34; the full charge level.  For the money it costs, this is a very nice little unit.  If you are using it on a large car or truck battery, this will maintain the charge, but is a bit small to attempt to charge a low or dead battery if it is a large one.  For small batteries and such, this will charge them just fine.  I use it to maintain a motorcycle battery with no problem.  Schumacher is an excellent long time company and with Amazon's guarantee you won't go wrong.  Enjoy! 
Truly an impressive assembly of 4 parts. If there is a finer example of a little piece of rubbery roll-y wheel attached to a wooden handle with some metal parts in the middle tying it all together, show me. These seem to be happiest on concrete or hard ground, if the ground is soft or slightly unlevel they bow and will not stabilize the inside of the 5th wheel. Two of thes pads, under my Camco RV jack stands, raise the stands to the proper heighth for my pop-up.  They don't slip or slide on hard or soft surfaces. 
I have used numerous different sponges and wash mitts on my cars over the years, with varying results. The microfiber wash mith from Meguiar's ranks up there as the best one I have used. It is safe for the cars finish and it doesn't trap as much dirt on the mitt like other mitts have in the past. In the event that it does, simply running the mitt over a grit guard loosens up anything and you are back to washing in a flash.I have been a fan of Meguiar's products for years, and this particular accessory is no different. It has made washing my vehicle much easier and also more enjoyable. The dash of my black car is anthracite gray, and it shows dust easily. The California duster is created for either exteriors or interiors of cars and is impregnated with paraffin wax. This picks up the dust and the soft fibers float over the uneven surfaces of the car interior, picking it all up in one swipe.I keep this in the car and once a week I swipe down the interior all over to keep the car sparkling clean. It's small enough to keep handy under the seat.This makes a really nice gift for someone to congratulate them on their new car, or for someone who likes doing their own detailing. I have always been a fan of handwashing my vehicles but over the years I have sometimes come across the problem of leaving small scratches or swirl marks on the surface due to dirt/grit staying on my wash mitt/sponge. After purchasing two grit guards for the 2 bucket wash method, I couldn't be happier!By simply running your wash materials over the guard, it loosens up the dirt and debris removed from your car, sending it right to the bottom of the bucket. This allows you to get a clean mitt every time and it keeps the dirt from landing back on your car.If you are a fan of washing your car and keeping it looking new like I am, I would suggest picking up a grit guard or two. Your car's finish will thank you for it! 
These are good quality cloths by Meguiar's. I believe my next set will be to try the Cobra brand so I have different colors for different purposes. Have Used Mothers protectant for years and love it. Does a great job and I like the smell. Have had numerous people make comments how our 2011 CRV looks and smells brand new still!! I have been using "instant detailers"for over a decade, mostly the Meguiar's product in the purple spray bottle. It did a good job, smelled nice, and left the car clean.  But as I am always looking for a better shine, I decided to give the Mother's Instant Detailer a try, and I'm glad I did.  Indeed, until I decided to try the Mother's product, I assumed that all "instant detailers" were pretty much alike. Not so!  In my experience, the Mother's product not only cleans the car but it also produces greater shine, depth and gloss. It also seems to brighten the finish as well.  My take: it's a superior product.Mother's Instant Detailer is very mild, it smells great, and makes a noticeable difference in a car's appearance. I no longer use the other brand.Since discovering Mother's Instant Detailer I have tried a number of other Mother's wax products, and found them to be at least a notch or two above the current offerings of the major retail store competitors.  Of course, car detailing goals and results can be very subjective; nonetheless, for the discriminating car enthusiast who wants their car to look its best, do yourself a favor and give this product a try -- I think you'll like it. 
Mitt holds lots of water and both sides can be used as it is a flat style with cuff. Used in place of the cheap microfiber cloths and was truly impressed with how quick they cleaned and polished interior of car and also I use one to wipe down chrome wheels. Leaves them streakless. Thanks. These applicators work perfectly and clean up easily. Whether using them for interior leather or surface wax application, they do not mar the surfaces and spread whatever coat of Meguiar's you're using evenly and safely. 
This kit has everything you need to wash, wax, polish, and maintain your vehicle.  (Less the bucket and water)  Park your car in a shady place and hose it off to cool it down real good.  Use the peanut sponge and the Gold Soap on the right of the picture (you only need a cap or two per gallon of water) and wash the car off really well.  The soap smells like candy while you're washing.  Makes you wanna eat your car.  After you're good and clean hit the rims ONE AT A TIME with the purple (middle) bottle.  They tire cleaner is safe on clear coated rims too.  Don't let it sit too long before you wipe and rinse your rims.  The white tire foam should turn brown after a few seconds when it comes into contact with brake dust and dirt.  Once your car is spotless and clean, it's time to dry it.  Microfiber cloth that's included does the job here.  Ring it out really well every so often so it drys your car completely.  Then comes the red bottle (far left) and the round applicator sponge.  Do not get this wax on anything but your paint!  And don't use too much because a little goes a long way!  If you have vinyl/rubber trim around your windows be VERY CAREFUL!  It will leave a white waxy residue if you get it on it since it's (duh!) wax.  After you wax the entire car get another completely dry microfiber cloth.  Go to where you originally started waxing and start buffing it out with 4 inch circles or infinity loops.  The wax should be dry(ish) while you're doing this.  Don't be afraid to use a different piece of the cloth if you get a little build up of wax.  Once your car is buffed out you should be good.  You can use the Black spray bottle on your interior.  It's good on almost all surfaces except cloth.  The red spray bottle is touch up for your wax coat.  I had bird poop on my car the next morning after I waxed it and I used a microfiber cloth and it wiped right away.  Nothing could stick to it.  Then I used the red spray and buffed it back out.  The red spray bottle is also good for getting rid of water spots after it rains on your fresh wax job.  The bottles will tell you to do pretty much exactly what I just told you.  If you do it right, your car should gleam for a week easy! this stuff is great. It cuts through brake dust that soap wont even touch.however you cant really just leave it on for 30 seconds and spray it off. if the cleaner sits on one area too long, it begins to dry, and leaves behind residue. I find its best to use a couple sprays of this on a sponge with a liberal dose of water. Rinse quickly, do multiple scrub downs if needed. You only need a spritz, so its not like you have to worry about wasting product.Use it right and you'll love it. a bottle lasts me at least 6 months of almost weekly washing. There are a few things to know about the absorber to get the most out of them.  First, before using, soak in warm water, this makes it more absorbent.  Second, keep it clean.  The wort thing you could do is have a dirty chamois and drag it across your paint, this will introduce maring of your clear coat.  I wash it on gentle cycle with a little distilled vinegar then air dry.  When storing, get it as dry as possible.  Ive had them get moldy in the container from being too damp. 
I have a dark colored car, so I purchased one of those "black" tinted spray waxes which claimed it also cleans and shines black plastic and metal trim.  Wrong.  I also use a regular (not black) liquid spray polish detailer.  It's okay on regular black plastic and window trim surfaces.But neither could clean the paste wax residue ruining the look of the textured black plastic on top of my rear bumper.  But Mothers Back-to-Black certainly did.  Now my car looks showroom new again.The product is a cream colored liquid (not black).  So my product applicator (an old sock) and my wiping cloth (an old t-shirt, both from my husband) aren't stained.  I'm very happy and I would I highly recommend this product to everyone. This polish really does a beautiful job on virtually any metal.I would guess I've been using this polish for over 30 yearsand have found there's pretty much no end to what this polish is good for.It gives a gleaming shine on:Brass ~ silver ~ copper ~ gold ~ chrome ~ aluminum ~ pewter ~ stainless steel ~ and more.It's not good on many painted nor plated surfaces as it may remove paint & plating.I can say from experience that it ruins/removes the gold or silver flashing on china.I use this on so many things that I keep tubes of simichrome in the house & garage for convenience.Plus carry it in both the car & truck as it's proven to be very use-full when antiquing.Especially for checking if an item is Bakelite.The pink polish will turn a yellowish (dark yellow to a canary) if it's Bakelite ~no matter what color of Bakelite your testing.The polish will stay pink if it's not Bakelite.While cleaning our un-hearted garage this past fall I found a particle tube behind a cabinetthat must have been there for over 20 years ~ and it was still fresh & worked like new!Freezing doesn't damage it, I leave it in the garage & autos years around.This polish leaves a protective finish so metals don't darken again as quickly ~while adding a beautiful shine. First off, don't get turned off by the name, Yellow is the color of the stuff, it won't turn your paint yellow!  It does look great on yellow paint though, also reds and darker colors like dark blue and black.  For lighter colors you are better off going with something else, Collinite 845 is a great choice.Pros:-DRIPPY wet looks.  You'll want to grab a towel and dry your paint, its that wet!-Decent durability, approx 2-3 months on a car parked outdoors-Fills in minor swirling-Leaves paint nice and slickCons:-Stains trim (rubber, black plastic)-Needs to be applied very thin, otherwise it can be hard to take off-Can streak if used on a hot surface or if too much is usedOverall, this is a great wax that has been around for a very long time because it looks so great.  its a total steal at the price. 
Once you use this tool you'll know why it is so handy.  It is a must have if you do any hose work in the engine bay.After use I put a dab of WD40 on the area that grabs the hose to maintain it. I try to avoid doing rear brake jobs with drums as best a possible....LOLSo to that end, i have only used this tool a few times.It's effectiveness really depends on the design of the brake job you're doing.  But it's been really good so far for me.Doing rear brakes is like going to battle.  Every fight is going to be different so you have to find the right &#34;Weapon&#34; to do battle with.  Not Like doing caliper brakes.  What do you use???  Sockets and wrenches and DONE!!!!  With rear brakes it feels like you will use anything you can find that will help you win the battle.  LOL!!!!you just have to becareful not to bend the springs when using this tool cause it can happen really easily.It's very handy to have in your arsenal of tools. I got these for use on my Victory Vision motorcycle. I do not use a lift or stand and though a little tight I was able to get plenty of grip and twist on the filter to make for an easy change. They grips work well even with oily hands. Simple tool that works as it should. 
After reading the reviews, I decided to give this a shot.  It's easy to apply and remove and smells a lot better than the Carnauba wax by mother, but it did not provide the same glossy "wet" look.  I prefer the Ca Gold Carnauba wax over this one.I have about 4 bottles of Wax and I always seem to go back to the Carnauba wax.  The other 3 are just collecting dust.Read my reviews and see pics of my review below.Mothers 05750 California Gold Pure Brazilian Carnauba Wax Liquid - 16 oz (Ultimate Wax System, Step 3) OK, must say, love my cars and want them to look great. In the last decades, I've used a huge array of the waxes out there, in the never ending quest for the perfect shine: Meguire's, (many versions) Turtle Wax, Zymol, Liquid Glass, Future 2000, Black Magic, Rain Dance, 3M, Turtle Wax Ice (paste and liquid), Turtle Wax Black Box, Mother's, Color Magic, etc. Liquid, paste, carnauba, synthetic, carnauba/sytntetic, cleaner wax, cleaner polish wax, polish wax, clay bar system, liquid clay bar. And those are just the ones off the top of my head!With that said, here are the conclusions:- I've never noticed a real difference between most any of them with respect to how the car looks after I've applied them. Put them on and the car looks great. This applies to the true waxes - the quickie things like Turtle Wax Liquid Ice, which isn't a wax at all IMHO, being the exceptions.- For most all of them, if you look at on line reviews, one will say it's the best and greatest, the next will hate it. So, VERY subjective.- Seems the more it costs and/or the more aplication effort involved, the higher it rates and the more staunch the opinions. Think there is a HUGE self fulfilling prophecy going on here;) Liquid Glass was expensive and a huge pain to apply (it looked just like any other I've used), yet it is rated 5 stars by most.- Carnauba provides the strongest protection against physical damage by stones and road debris. BUT is harder to apply and least durable over time.- Synthetic provides the most durable protection against the elements. AND is easy to apply.- God help me for saying this, but I can't tell a huge difference between a carnauba and synthetic wax job - both shine beautifully.That said, the goals of waxes/waxing is: Great shine, durable protection, less work, less needed yearly applications and reasonable pricing.So, here is the secret formula for those goals:1) Wax twice a year.2) Apply a carnauba/cleaner wax coat3) Apply Turtle Wax Ice PASTE coat - this is a good synthetic, but it's real advantage is that it is CLEAR. Not only does it not leave ANY white residue, but it can and should be used on all surfaces of the exterior - paint and PLASTICS. So, it is fast to apply/remove and it makes plastics look brand new.To the review of Nu Finish, it is a fine synthetic with the advantages of being highly rated for durability by "a leading consumer magazine" (as was Turtle Wax Ice Paste)and being easy to apply and remove - can do a whole car in like 45 minutes. BUT, it leaves the hated white residue, especially on plastics.  We're it not for that, I would have given it 5 stars - like I would most any reputable wax product out there..... I've used many other 'over the counter' brands from Meguiar's NXT, GoldGlass to Eagle1 Nanowax and none of those products comes close to Mothers Pure Carnuba Wax when it comes to deep, reflective shine and ease of use. Period.I started using this product and noticed the difference right away. Seriously, this is the most underrated wax on the market. Anyone with a black car should give this wax a shot and I will make a bet that you too will see the difference.  Even my coworkers saw the difference right away.  Just by switching to this wax.  They commented that it was "brighter and really glossy".This wax does provide a very nice, reflective shine.  Very easy to apply and wipe off. You won't be disappointed with this wax.  Other waxes (especially those synthetic polymers wax) Such as NXT requires that you wait at least  20 minutes for the wax to dry before you buff it out.  Even then, they still show signs of "smears or streaks or oily residue" on dark colored cars.  This carnuba wax dries in no time.  By the time you apply the last coat, you can start buffing out the first panel you apply the wax on.The shine is just simply amazing.  The smell however is not.This is one of the most underrated waxes out there.  Do yourself and your car a favor and get this wax. (See comments for pics!) 
I give my 4 year old car a full cleaning treatment at least twice a year.  About a month ago when I just finished my pre-winter car cleaning ritual a neighbor walked by and ask me if it was a new car shining in my drive way.  That's when you know the wax did its job well.Meguiar Gold Liquid Wax not only does a great job, it is easy to work with if you follow simple steps below:WASHI wash the car first using a detergent designed for car washing, as it removes the grime better. I use microfiber towels to wash.  What you use to wash makes a big difference, a good micro fiber towel makes the job go faster and it does a good job with the smallest amount of effort.BE COOLI wash either in the shade or in the evening when the sun is not strong. Strong sun will dry out the water too soon and working with dry finish can lead to small abrasions. Hot paint finish is also easier to damage. So I make sure the car is cool while I am working on it. I wash the top of the car, then the bottom of the car.  I don't want dirty water streaming down on the clean portions.DRYThen I dry the car which helps remove whatever dirt might have remained on the car after the wash.  I use more micro fiber towels.  I like Costco's micro fiber towel bag, for $10 you get a big bag of high quality towels of just the right size.CLAYI check the car for any dirt that the water did not take off and clay those areas.  I don't clay the entire car, just the areas where I see imperfections.WAXI apply the wax to another micro fiber towel, spread it on a small portion of the car (3 feet by 3 feet), then wipe it off with another micro fiber towel.  If you let the wax sit too long it will become difficult to buff off, that's why working on small areas is better.  If I drop a towel, I move on to the next one.  Even tiny dirt particles you can't see will scratch the paint surface.  I try avoid getting wax on plastic parts.  If I do get it on the plastic parts, see "back to black" described below.BACK To BLACKThe final step is to apply Back to black solution to plastic parts of the car.  It makes the plastic look new, and it is not harmful to the painted surfaces. Back to black solution effectively removes any wax residue you might have gotten on to the plastic parts, it also takes care of the sun damage to the plastic.This procedure takes me about an hour.  I love riding in a shiny clean car plus I always get great value back when I sell my cars.Meguiar's Gold Wax is one of my "secret" weapons to make a four year old car look like new.  I recommend it!Ali Julia review I love these microfiber cloth! I use them to clean everything! Mostly for my cars! They do not leave scratches on your car and can be use for almost anything! Used in place of the cheap microfiber cloths and was truly impressed with how quick they cleaned and polished interior of car and also I use one to wipe down chrome wheels. Leaves them streakless. Thanks. 
Good and cheap. This is great oil I use RP in all my vehicles from air compressor up to truck. This gear oil works great in my 05 F150's front diff. Great value and great water filter 
It's a good sturdy product, but it's impossible to level my motorhome with them. That's probably not what they're made for though, so the dislike is because of my mistake of buying for the wrong application, not the product.  ~Pegleg~ Even without a lot of mechanic knowledge or doing much mechanic work, this item is worth the price. Stick here or there and hear what you can't otherwise. It is great for the person shopping for a used car and you will know when you hear something that isn't right.As for the home mechanic, it is invaluable in pinpointing where things are wrong. Fuel injectors, pistons, valves, anything that moves.And for the computer tech, I have also found this device is great for finding soon to be faulty harddrives. You can hear everything that is going on without disconnecting anything. Long before real problems come up, this thing can find them.As for quality, it really is just a plastic tube with the correct diaphragm at the end to convert the metal pole vibrations to audible noise. Its is FAR better than naked ears, but there are many products out there that are better than this. As valuable as it has been, I would have paid for a better quality version if I were to buy one again. I have an FJ Cruiser.  It's not a quiet vehicle.  I accept that.I have been working on upgrading my stereo system - replaced the head unit, put in 6x9 speakers in the doors, etc.  Well, the 6x9s are much more responsive than the stock speakers were, especially in the lower frequencies.  So, I developed a buzz.  I bought the Dynamat to see if I could get rid of that, after I tightened everything that I could find.Installation was easier than I feared - thanks for the tennis ball tip, BTW!  As far as the real results, though, I'm not sure that I've noticed a real difference in sound quality, noise, or heat.  Perhaps some.  The rattling has reduced, but not eliminated.Does the product work?  Possibly.  It's hard for me to say either way. 
If you are going to wax your vehicle (which you should about twice a year in a cool spot in the shade) you should evaluate the clear and if it has a lot of swirl marks you should consider polishing the car and then waxing it. I like to do the mothers three step process polish, micro polish, and wax but i still had some of this so i used this as step one. I used this product in conjunction with an appropriate primer and clearcoat, all from VHT, to paint my car's brake calipers bright glossy red.step 1) remove brake dust, grease, and rust using a brake caliper cleaning agent of some kind.  Also use a wire brush if you can.step 2) Sand your calipers using 320-grit sandpaper.  Really rough them up.  Then use some more brake cleaner.step 3) Mask off your car's corner  body panels, the wheel wells, the struts and hoses, and finally, the brake rotors.  Take the time to mask the bleed valves on the calipers too.step 4) Apply primer to the caliper in a very light, speckled coat, then move to the next caliper until you've applied a coat to all 4.  Do this 4 times, gradually getting heavier, but avoid letting the paint run (it's okay if it happens in the primer).  Try to do this as quickly as possible.step 5) Apply your base color (THIS PRODUCT) using the same method as in step 4: light coats multiple times.  I suggest a sweeping method, rather than just spraying hard.  Do NOT allow the base color to run.step 6) Apply a clear coat using the same method as in steps 4 and 5, but be careful not to overdo it.  Clear coats can run more easily than base colors.  The paint should be looking thick and glossy by this time.step 7) Wait an hour. Drink a beer or something.step 8) Remove your masking.  Gaze upon your new calipers.  Then, use some brake cleaner to remove any overspray from the brake rotors or undercarriage areas.  Do NOT use brake cleaner to clean body panels, as it will probably remove the paint.step 9) put your wheels back on.  wait a few more hours.  THEN drive your car pretty hard, making sure to go fast, and brake hard.  This will heat your brakes up.  The paint needs to cure at 200F, which means you need to drive and brake repeatedly.  Don't go too nuts.That's it!  All finished. Wish it were cheaper, but I won't use a product that might damage the paint on my classic - so I pay the price.  Only reason for not giving it another star is how much it costs.  Using a stretched out 2x3 inch piece of clay along with the Meguiar's Detailing Spray for lubrication makes pretty easy work for a step that I'm not that fond of doing.  I'm always shocked at how much garbage the clay picks up from what looked like a clean paint surface.  The smoothness after going over the paint shows that this stuff is working great.  Cleaning the car with soap and water is the first step, and using the clay is definitely the necessary second step before moving on to polishing and waxing. 
GLAD  I  WENT  WITH  THE  CHROME AND  NOT  THE BLACK ONE, I  HOOKED  THIS ONE UP TO  MY GV1400 MOTORCYCLE IF  YOU  HAVE JUST  A  LITTLE  KNOW  HOW YOU CAN  DO  IT YOUR SELF , ALL  YOU WILL NEED TO GO WITH THIS IS A RELAY THAT DOES NOT COME WITH IT. YOU  CAN  GET IT ON HERE OR ANY PART STORE, I  HAVE MADE MANY PEOPLE JUMP  DUE  TO THE SOUND OF  THE  HORNS  LOUDNESS. I bought this to look in my winch on my Jeep. I just took one of the bolts out and put this in, I would thing if they really want it I'm sure they can get it out, this just makes it a little harder and if you install two they will have to work twice as hard. And for the price you can buy two.. I have a 2008, Ford F150 FX2 Sport, Supercab. I had never done anything with sound, to any vehicle I had ever owned, that was so extensive. I am so glad I did. I absolutely love this stuff and will probably put it in any vehicle I own, whether I do a sound system or not. It just quiets things down. It gets a bit sticky at times but comes right off your fingers. Be careful with small pieces that you want to throw away, they may end up back on the bottom of your foot. It took me a solid weekend to do the front to the back and doors. If you have the time, do it. 
with plastic bumpers being the norm, thought I'd use this plastic polish.  It brings the shine to the plastic painted areas just like step 2 does to the metal. This is a reinforced bracket with a plastic coating, very strong feeling when mounted securely.  No flex as I plug in/out of it.  The sockets seem to be likewise, very solid and secure feeling. The Universal 'Solid Hardened Steel' Trailer Lock helps me feel more secure these days. Appears strong and resilient.

You only need a spritz, so its not like you have to worry about wasting product.Use it right and you'll love it. a bottle lasts me at least 6 months of almost weekly washing. Yes it is a water magnet;however like another reviewer said, it's so magnetic where it won't let the water go no matter however many times you wring it. Sure drops will come off, but the potency of drying will not be at 100% as if the towel was completely dry. I would recommend a chamois or an absorber, they seems to wring out water alot better as well as soak water up. Just figure out a technique. And victory will be yours. So the case of the drying water magnet, I'll give it a four since it does what it's title says. And a bit easier to use than the chamois. But you get what you pay for. 
When I bought a new car last year I wanted to get all new cleaning supplies so after some research I ended up buying this Mequiar's package and it was a great investment! I put everything in an easy to carry plastic tool holder I had so I'm able to take everything out to the driveway when I wash the car and use what I need at the time.I regularly use the wash mitt, car wash and Quik Interior Detailer to get quick clean great looking results. One day after washing I noticed something on the paint that felt kind of rough. I rubbed down that area with a clay bar then applied some wax and it was better than new again.The car wash is great because you don't have to use much at all for a bucket full of wash. I have plans to wax the entire car real soon to see how the Gold Class wax is to use but haven't yet. The 3M Performance Finish wax is really something else. I absolutely love it. I've been using it for about a year or so now. It leaves a soft and smooth feeling on the paint and beads up like you wouldn't believe and also lasts quite a while. I just recently waxed a good portion of my car with Mother's Carnuaba Cleaner wax and it actually did not bead at all. With this kind of wax, allowing it to dry and haze is required for it to work properly. I did just that, but the next time I washed my car, the water came off so slowly and in "sheets" rather than beads. So then I used my 3M... exactly what I was expecting. And this stuff doesn't need to haze one bit. If you do let it haze, it actually leaves some streaks behind. Just work one small section at a time, applying the wax and then pretty much immediately wiping it back off. It's that simple. Also, clay bar your car and then follow that with the 3M... like butter. This stuff is worth every penny. I just waxed my whole car with it the other day and I'm going to do the same thing next time I wash it. It can't hurt to protect the paint. I'll be buying this stuff again and again and hopefully other 3M products. I use this on my three cars almost every day - sometimes twice a day depending on use.  I have cut down the number of times I have to wash the car and if I wash it comercially I save money and if I do it at home I save time.  The cars always look like I just waxed them and now I wax the cars less often than I did previously. 
If you do a lot of work with bearings or bearing assemblies, this can be a useful tool.  You simply hold the end of the probe against the housing or stationary bearing race, and listen.  A grinding or crunching sound means the bearing is rough/dry.  Used properly, it can save a lot of diagnostic time.  Quality seems to be good. Mitt holds lots of water and both sides can be used as it is a flat style with cuff. Great product and works well. However the Manufacture as a limitation on the packaging of not for DA (dual action) sander/buffer. I called and they said it only applies to this cutting pad and not the Finishing pad.... With that said I have used the pad with a DA buffer.... They said it will not hold up. I have no problem with it on a Porter-Cable DA.

Used in place of the cheap microfiber cloths and was truly impressed with how quick they cleaned and polished interior of car and also I use one to wipe down chrome wheels. Leaves them streakless. Thanks. this detailer is very easy to use and works well when you clay your car , it makes the clay slide easy and also cleans up quick so you can get to the waxing Easy to apply, easy to use. Moisten the surface to be cleaned lightly with a bit of water spray, then pour some Lexol cleaner on your hands. Don't worry, it's safe (as are most leather cleaning products. Remember, leather is basically skin). Rub it in everywhere, then use a soft brush to agitate the surface. Use a wet cloth to wipe the Lexol off. Bam! Clean as can be. You might be surprised how dirty your chair can get when you see the colour of the Lexol foam after scrubbing. Make sure you apply leather conditioner/oil after cleaning to maintain the leather itself. This product is only the cleaner side of things. 
I have had 4 Lexus and I have only used Meguire products on them.  My new Lexus is a black 2013 Lexus. This is the best wax to keep a great shine. The car finish is like glass. People remark to me about the shine and want to know what I use. I am a great advertisement for Meguire I actually was very surprised how how well these work. I was not sure about these at all but I loved how well and easily the wipe away the wax. Once done the paint on my car was soo smooth and silky to the touch. I purchased Meguiar's Gold Class Carnauba Plus Wax to use on an old Corvette I purchased. The car's finish was in pretty good shape despite being 22 years old. Since the paint was original, I didn't want anything to harsh, and I wanted to do it by hand. Much to my surprise, Meguiar's Gold Class Carnauba Plus Wax made the car look almost like new. The paint color is black, and it shines like a mirror. When my neighbor saw my car, he asked if I had it repainted. Besides looking great, the wax was also easy to get on and off. I really can't think of anything negative to say about it other than it costs more than most waxes. But in this case, you definitely get what you pay for. Highly recommended. 
If you want a good shine that will last because you hate waxing your car, then this is for you. I used it and it really did almost last for a year. I would say maybe 6-8 months or so. That is pretty good and close to a year. Be sure that your car is as clean as possible, you may want to use a polish before using this, but you are probably lazy since you hate waxing your car, so you can use this right after your car is washed. If you want to do the once over on your paint, once a year, I would recommend the following: Wash your car using Meguiars Gold Class; it is an excellent shampoo and conditioner for your car. Clay bar your car. The clay bar is probably the easiest product to use. It is almost effortless. You mist a section 18&#34; x 18&#34; with a quick detailer (yes Meguiars has an excellent quick detailer), then you use the clay bar with medium pressure. Make about 10 passes. Then you lightly wipe dry. Your paint will be very slick and you should not feel any grit after using it. Do NOT drop the clay or you may scratch the heck out of your paint.You have to throw it out and use a fresh clay bar. After you have completed the entire car with the clay bar, you can then use a polish. Yes I know Nu finish states that it is a polish, but we will pretend it is a protectant. Use a polish (similar to Meguiars polish - yes I love Meguiars products and no I do not have stock in the company). Then you can apply the Nu finish. One reviewer said to dampen the applicator; that is probably a good idea. Do one section at a time. As with any &#34;protectant products&#34; if you use too much it will be difficult to remove. Since you are going to be doing this once every 6-8 months, take the extra time and effort to do it correctly. After the Nu finish, may I suggest that you use Meguiars NXT 2.0. It is a polymer sealant that works very well. In summary:  Wash, Clay Bar, Polish, Nu Finish, and the optional poly sealant. If you are very lazy you can do your car in 2 steps. Drive it through the expensive car wash, and then use the Nu Finish. Good luck. I clayed the SUV in just several hours! This kit comes complete with the spray, 2 clay bars, and a microfiber cloth. Just wash the car well and start claying. You will be very happy with the difference your car feels after you clay! I will keep this simple. If you want to have a "Wet Look" paint finish, this can help you achieve that.  This is how I got my 3 year old car looking like a show car.1. Wash you car with Meguiars Car Wash.  Make sure to get all the dirt off.  Dry thoroughly.  I use a super absorbent chamois to speed up the process.  Make sure to do this in the shade.  The car's surface should be cool to the touch.2. Use the Meguiars Claybar. Keep going until your hand glides on top of the paint.  This will give your paint a glass smooth finish.3. Apply Meguiars Paint Cleaner with a Random Orbital Buffer or Meguiars Buffer.  This will remove any stains and very fine swirls.4. Apply this Mirror Glaze with the Random Orbital buffer.  Wipe off and buff using a Microfiber Cloth.5. Apply your choice of Meguiars Waxes with the Orbital buffer.  I personally prefer the Meguiars NXT wax because I dont have to wait long after applying the wax before I can wipe off and buff.6.  Maintain this new finish by using the Mequiars Ultimate Quick Detailer often to clean any dust,tree sap or bird droppings that may land on your car. The Detailer will keep it lookng great and also extend the UV protection.You just need to do this entire process once or twice a year.  Regularly, you just need to wash your car at least once a week.  And you can re-apply Meguiars wax once a month or as often as you like as their waxes do not damage your clear coat.  That is why I only use their products. 
I required an ammonia-free window cleaner for my tinted windows. This does the job quite nicely. It isn't how well it does, rather how safely it does it. Ordered this so we could do oil change jobs on our 2010 equinox.  Yes it works for the 2.4 as well as the 2.2 that its advertised for.  Does the job as intended.  Don't like the way chevy set up their filters but oh well what can you do. works really well and easy to use.  . . . . . . . . . . . . . 
I clayed the SUV in just several hours! This kit comes complete with the spray, 2 clay bars, and a microfiber cloth. Just wash the car well and start claying. You will be very happy with the difference your car feels after you clay! I used this wheel cleaner this past weekend on my stock painted alloy wheels. They had become dirty with brake dust and road grime and the drive through car wash was no help. With the nice weather I treated the car to a personal car wash. I followed the instructions and the wheels are clean. The only problem is you need to use a lot of the foaming spray to cover the wheels various surfaces. On my car one 24 oz. bottle should cclean the four wheels twice. Since this is the first wheel cleaner of this type I'm not sure if that expensive. However, I'm very please with the easy no touch results. I learned about Gold Clay Bars in a Honda CRV forum, where car enthusiasts shared their favorite products.This was three years ago. Since then I clay my car twice a year, in the spring  and the the fall.I just finished my spring treatment when a fellow walked by my car and asked if this was 2011 CRV that I waswashing.  I told him it was almost 4 years old and he could not believe it.  I have toadmit that the car does look like new with much of the credit to regular claying and using back-to-blackon plastic parts.I should mention that I store Gold Clay in a plastic container which used to contain onion dip.  This keeps it pliable and clean.  It is a bit strange that the container for clay did not come with the package.  If clay dries out it will stop working. And it is sticky, so if you leave it without some sort of container it will pick up dirt that could scratch the car the next time you use it.Claying system removes contaminants that attach themselves to the car. Clay does not polish the car or remove any paint of finish, so it is totally safe to the finish if used properly (i.e. with plenty of lubrication).The clay material (which feels like play-doh)makes the small particulars that are deposited on the car finish attach themselves to the clay and get lifted from the car finish. Clay needs to be used with heavy lubrication, which Showtime Instant Detailer, included in this package, provides.I start by washing my car. I don't dry it as this time as water drops will be removed by other steps. Then I clay the car. I don't clay every inch of the entire car. I just examine the car by sight for any imperfections and by my running my hand over the paint to feel any tiny bumps. When I feel some grittiness or see some dirt on the paint, I generously spray that section with Showtime Instant Detailer, then knead the piece of clay in my hand and rub it against the spot I identified. Normally, you see the dirt disappear in a few swipes.  Sometimes you need to reapply the Detailer and repeat.  Kneading is important as you want to work the little pieces of dirt into the clay, and not leave it on the surface of the clay ball where it can scratch the car. This year we had a rough winter and I had some rubber marks from my snow removal tool in addition to the regular dirt specs.  Clay did a great job on removing those marks.I also use the clay on non-painted areas such as glass and chrome. It does a great job as well. After the claying step I wax the car is small sections.Mothers 05701 California Gold Carnauba Cleaner Wax Liquid - 16 ozAs my final step I apply Back-to-blackMothers 06108 Back-To-Black - 8 ozto non-painted surfaces. This turns the dull plastic into shiny new looking surface.  Back-to-black is also effective in removing any wax that might have accidently got on the plastic, that's why I do back-to-black as the last step. 
I have used this solvent a number of times to remove adhesive and badging from my cars.  For that it works wonderfully.  When used modestly it does not effect automotive surfaces or glass.  Since this stuff is so potent, I would recommend using the the spray straw in the nozzle so that you can more carefully target where you spray this stuff.  You want to be very careful where you put it.  It also evaporates rapidly so you need to work quickly when you use it.Just to reinforce a few precautions:- Do not get this on plastic (it will discolor it) or any soft/organic materials.- Do not use around high eat, as it is extremely flammable- Limit all bodily exposureOverall this is a wonderful product, just be very careful how you use it. Once you use this tool you'll know why it is so handy.  It is a must have if you do any hose work in the engine bay.After use I put a dab of WD40 on the area that grabs the hose to maintain it. Do yourself a HUGE favor and use a mass flow (MAF) senor cleaner to clean the MAF sensor.  DON'T use carburetor, fuel injector or throttle body cleaner or you'll ruin the MAF sensor. 
If you have never used a clay bar on your car, this is going to blow your mind.  It is very easy to use, and only takes a few minutes - but yields the most amazing results.  The clay bar pulls the dirt (after a regular wash) from the paint and leaves a totally smooth mirror-like finish.  I've been using the Mother's version for a few years and each clay bar can last a dozen or so uses before it needs to be replaced - unless you drop it on the ground.  The spray is essentially very light soap water, but it provides all the lube you need.  I usually add this into the three step process after washing and polishing, but before waxing.You will simply not belive the before and after difference you will feel when running your fingers across the paint.Also works great on glass. If you want a good shine that will last because you hate waxing your car, then this is for you. I used it and it really did almost last for a year. I would say maybe 6-8 months or so. That is pretty good and close to a year.

Drive it through the expensive car wash, and then use the Nu Finish. Good luck. I use the applicators for more then waxing cars. They are also good for staining wood. The fome applicators work ok, but don't lay wax evenly when waxing paint. I wet the applicator and ring out the extra water. Just making the applicator damp. Apply the wax to the applicator, fold the applicator in half so the wax spreds and apply to the paint. Same way as the movie.... wax on, wax off....lol 
Exactly what I needed to add to my box of wheelin components, I'll save a tree when I need to hook up & pull &#34;other&#34; people out CAVEAT: I have a front-wheel drive car, and I *back* into my garage.  The parking mat goes under my rear (un-driven) wheels.  Perhaps that makes my experience different from some of the others.I found about this product from a show on Speed Channel that was talking about garage products.  The host said the big benefit of this mat was that your tire rolled onto the front part of the mat first, holding it down, before it rolled it over the hump.  Thus, this mat didn't need to be fixed to your garage floor.  That's what I wanted: something that didn't need to be permanently attached to the floor.  The guy on TV didn't even mention that it came with tape.I did put a little masking tape on the garage floor to mark where I typically position the mat, so I can remove it (to sweep or whatever) and replace it right back where it goes as needed.  I don't use the adhesive tape it comes with to adhere it to the floor.  In my case, it works perfectly, just like the guys on Speed Channel described.  I've used it for a little over a month now, and my mat simply doesn't move.  (Ok, maybe it moves some ridiculously trivial amount, but for all intents and purposes, it has stayed put for a month.)  If the mat is going under your driven wheels or steering wheels, I can understand how it might move around.Others have complained that the mat is too narrow.  I wouldn't complain if they made it a little wider, but I don't have much trouble hitting it as it is. I learned about Gold Clay Bars in a Honda CRV forum, where car enthusiasts shared their favorite products.This was three years ago. Since then I clay my car twice a year, in the spring  and the the fall.I just finished my spring treatment when a fellow walked by my car and asked if this was 2011 CRV that I waswashing.

I used this on my vinyl deck where a protective pad for the grill had left a huge stain. The stain was removed with minimal effort. It also took some sticker residue off a plastic waste basket, the kind of residue that grabs dirt and dust if you can't get the entire label off cleanly the first time you peel it off; sometimes those labels just won't budge.Moving on, it removed a light dusting of latex paint (pale yellow) from a sealed hardwood floor, and also was handy for a pet stain on the wall (DO NOT ASK me about that stain. I'm still shuddering from the clean-up) and it also worked on the soot on the back of the glass over the fireplace.Summary: cleans evil dirt, smells divine. A must-have in my arsenal of home maintenance items. cleans very well removes brake dust and stuck on grime..need to spray on and let soak scrub with brush..hose off..if stains are old or been on rims for awhile you will have to do a second clean but it will remove 95% of grime I assumed this product would work much like 409, meaning a rating of "useless" in the garage.Working on cars, I do try to avoid using the strong, chemically aggressive automotive solvents. Generally, you want the weakest solvent possible to adequately dissolve the unwanted material, while leaving the surface underneath intact. KK's "natural/biodegradable" formula seems to make it particularly effective at dissolving grease and oily buildup, which are also natural in origin, but leaving surfaces unharmed.Off to the garage.. I needed to clean the firewall cavity of a car, which included organic slime from old leaves, but was mostly covered with a layer of dense, greasy dirt - a combination of the endless supply of airborne grit from the road and the oily vapor residue of the engine compartment. KK did an admirable job, basically dissolving the bad stuff and leaving the painted metal and insulation, and rubber sealing grommets, intact and shiny. Most areas only needed one application and a wipe.You do, however, need to rinse off anything that is bare metal, especially (less dense) aluminum. I overlooked a couple of drops when rinsing an aluminum air intake plenum that I cleaned up. The next morning, I noticed some corrosion having developed at those locations. So, rinse well when you are cleaning metal, since KK is not chemically inert. Also I need to give a particular nod to its ability to clean up rubber hoses. Unlike using most water based solvents on rubber, which just smear the dirt along, it lifts the grease and dirt up, which then gets absorbed into your rag/towel and leaves the rubber clean and supple.KK covers the entire range of cleaning duties between the many water-based solvents that can't handle dirt-infused grease and the extremely destructive chemical power of carburetor cleaner, which will begin to dissolve rubber, plastics and paint. Plus, it doesn't even smell bad. Two thumbs, way up. 
Perfect for washing the RV...strong pole you can scrub as high as you need to go or can leverage. Holds its position when set.  Very pleased. Most of the sprays  I have used in the past leave a sticky film on the dash, which ends up collecting more dust and dirt that has to be cleaned off.  No such problem when using Vinylex.  Easy to apply and performs outstandingly well!!! I used this on the front carpet in the car.The stuff works.. It removed &#34;ALL&#34; whatlooked like permanent stains with 2 applicationsone on top of the other. 
This is THE high temp silicone gasket sealant for stopping leaks or forming a makeshift seal in a pinch if you can't find a gasket. In automotive work, thread sealant has become commonly needed and used on modern aluminum engines and transmissions, magnesium transfer cases and differentials, bolts that go through water jackets, and drain and fill plugs to prevent fluid leaks. These new metals cannot be tightened to the higher torque levels that were used when the components were iron or steel, and the thread sealer prevents leaks at lower torque levels. It should be used on the bolt or plug threads when doing service work on these components. So, that's why I bought and use it, There are many types of these sealants, but this product is specially designed for automotive components, and it works perfectly to prevent leaks, and to prevent bolt or plug seizing that damages threads.The price on Amazon is low, and this correct product is hard to find in my area. I am pleased with the purchase. Used this to diagnose my EVAP system in my 03 grand cherokee.  Had a few cracked hoses and a faulty leak detection pump.  This allowed me to rule out the duty cycle purge valve (~$100), the vent valve (~$15), the vapor canister (~$100), and also helped me diagnose the leak detection pump failing.  It has already paid for itself. 
I use it on every wash that I do.If your a car guy and keep your vehicles nice this is a great product.If your working on a vehicle that has been abused it may take you two or three times to get the wheels looking good.You may have to scrub the wheels by hand to clean off the real dirty areas, and possibly use tar and or bug remover to get them nice and clean.But once you do that, from there in all you need to do is wash the wheels down, spray the wheel cleaner on and let it sit for a few minutes and pressure wash it off. No need to hand wash.And the wheels look really nice. excellent product, cleans very well, sometimes you need to use a microfiber brush, but even with the brush , the dirt becomes very loose and easy to remove.pros: cleans very well, safe with no complications, non acidiccons: bottle enough for barley to finish on time clean, you need at least two bottles to finish the job well, including the wheels behind the spokes, thats i why i don't give it afullmark. This product is an effective way to remove dust and pollen in between car washes. I have used it for several years without any problems, and recently bought a new one to replace the one that got ruined in Hurricane Irene this past summer (my garage was flooded). Here is why I like it:1. This cleans without harming the car finish or leaving streaks.IMPORTANT: Follow the directions to place this on newspaper for 48 hours before first use. That is to get rid of excess wax that can cause streaking.2. This covers a large area, so the time to clean is reduced.3. This is easy to clean (just shake it out) and works great no matter how dirty it gets.4. This is well made and durable.Note: This is not a substitute for going to a car wash or using other cleaners. It does nothing, for example, to remove water spots or bird droppings. It also does nothing to give your car the shine that only wax can do. But it is a great way to maintain your car in between car washes. 
With the proper sized pan head machine screws these plastic chrome screw covers fit well.  I've used them for about three years.  In the past year a couple of the caps were lost so I purchased some new sets. This is just the perfect fit for my 2001 Honda Accord - passenger side. I bought a pair along with the driver side wiper that is 5 inch longer. Replacing is a cinch (I mean if you have already replaced a wiper before, all it takes is 30 seconds).My old one is steel framed "Rain X", it is broken now. Part of the rubber squeegee is peeling like a piece of string cheese hanging down. Not to discredit it, but it lasted also a couple of years and I have no problem getting the same product except I wanted to try something else. The Bosch 4819 is sleeker looking. Very lightweight and works perfect with no streaks. Very happy with it - I just have to see how long it will last through summer and winter seasons in Virginia weather. I just &#34;plastic welded&#34; my split in half camry front bumper with this and worked like it was never broken. A year later, my bumper is still in its shape! There is no indication that the piece put together would break at all! It's more of a possibility that there will be a breakage elsewhere than the original area that was broken. 
I love this funnel, it has so many uses. For example I can pour a liquid into a container with a small opening with great ease. I can hang it on a wall and it will wait there until I need to pour another liquid into a container with a small opening again. Let's see a hammer do either of those things. My hammer never stays put. You can reason with this funnel, it has an open mind so to speak. Others may try but they all fall short of the splendor that is this funnel. Works as advertised! Heavy duty construction. Don't know that I care for the bolt that hold it in place would rather use a locking pin as I do with all of my other hitch devices. But that can probably be remedied if I can get out the threaded insert. Fits great, and I love that i don't have to have the key in it to make it lock. I have to do that with the Master coupler and hitch lock that i use when transporting. 
Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.  The pickle fork is the last resort for me, as it will damage the balljoint boot.I prefer to use the Snap On balljoint remover.  If that one cannot fit, then I will try this tool.  If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork. Fits great, and I love that i don't have to have the key in it to make it lock. I have to do that with the Master coupler and hitch lock that i use when transporting. I used this tool to winterize our travel trailer.  Simply screw it on to your water hook-up, and then attach your standard air adaptor to your compressor hose - and presto - you're in business.The tip is flexible, but secure.  That is, after connecting your air hose to this plug, you can tip the hose in any of 360-degress, and it will flex.  This is great, because in colder weather a more rigid adaptor might break.I would recommend this plug for anyone that wants to winterize their RV, and I would purchase it again. 
Returned found better kit with colors that help match RV. You need kit with colors to match most applications. First, as with all of the Dupli-Color Metalcast paints, if you want the metalcast effect, you'll have to use the Dupli-Color Metalcast Ground Coat (MC100) on the surface before you apply the color or it will not come out right. The can says that it also comes out the same if you're painting directly onto chrome like surface but I have not tried this so I don't know. Now for this green. I'm more of a blue and purple guy for dark colors so only by my personal preference do I say that this green comes out just a tad light in color for me. Overall though, if you use the ground coat this comes out great with a nice metal sheen. I recommend this product. This is great wax! It truly deserves the Gold Class name. I use this after the Meguiar's Ultimate Polish. I also have migrated to a 6 in buffer/polisher. I used to do all of my polishing and waxing by hand, and with the buffer, this turns out great. I have an 89 LeSabre that is Black Sapphire in color. Before using the polish/wax combo, it looked more like a darker blue. Nothing really deep. After polishing and waxing, it now looks like the black in black sapphire. It looks great in the shade, as it should and looks beautiful in the sun. There is a nice deep, glassy color, and I am pleased with the results. The water also beads very nice, too. 
I lube my slideout and other seals and gaskets on my motorhome about twice a year.  This works well on the gaskets of the storage compartments.  Be aware that it is really messy to spray on.  You have to open your slides to access the seals, and this comes out of the can similar to engine degreaser - a foam that is messy.  It gets on the painted surfaces and needs to be wiped off promptly. With a straw from another lube can, I can spray it on the top gasket which is almost impossible to reach.  For the side gaskets on the slideout, I find that it is less messy to put on a plastic glove, spray it in my hand, and rub it on.  Works okay that way.  If you are on the road, and your slideout seal is sticking or binding, try baby power. This is an effective product, but Thetford needs to change the nozzle to control the mess. This is a very useful RV product.  Some RV parks and locales require this type of product to preclude sewerage spills.  It provides secondary protection in case the regular gray or black valve has a leak.  This way, when you take the cap off, a possible leak is held back by this valve (if it is properly closed).  The unit locks on just like a regular sewer drain hose fitting.  Unlike some other brands this unit turns on its axis so that you can align the valve handle exactly where you need it. This is THE high temp silicone gasket sealant for stopping leaks or forming a makeshift seal in a pinch if you can't find a gasket. 
The last time I drained my gray water tank on my trailer, I sort of cross threaded the cap and busted off on the the tabs, making the cap unusable.This is a great replacement and I like the fact that I can attach a hose to the cap to drain my gray water tank into a container, or if I am boondocking/dry camping, I can just run the hose away from my trailer to drain the sink water! I've used my Mityvac 7201 less than 10 times.  I have treated it very carefully, as I do all my stuff.  But still, it works poorly for me.The selector valve that you use to switch between evacuating/dispensing is ridiculously difficult to operate.  I can't just push or lift my selector valve to operate it.  No, I have to twist it while pushing/pulling like a madman, and hope I don't break anything (including my fingers).  I was able to loosen it up somewhat by spraying the valve with silicone/Teflon spray, and operating it repeatedly.  But (1) It's still not easy to operate, and (2) I shouldn't have to do that.The expandable plug that must be expanded to evacuate/dispense or removed to pour fluid out is ridiculously difficult to remove.  It's just a poor-fitting device.The tube connector where the main evacuation tube enters the top of the unit leaked when I put it in dispense mode.  I had to pay over $27 to get a replacement "Tube Connector Kit" (822566), since my unit is out of warranty.After replacing the tube connector and trying dispense mode again, I found that the top plate leaks.  I had not noticed this before, but it explains why it always took so much pumping when I evacuated oil!  When I use it in dispense mode now, the main tube doesn't leak anymore, but air and oil come out from under the top plate.  I removed the top plate, and sure enough, "Look Ma, no seal!"  It would be bad enough if the seal had merely failed, but for the seal not to be included in the first place is inexcusable.  Because I didn't notice this problem sooner, the seal (822821) is costing me an additional $13, including a ridiculous $8.75 fee for shipping.Now I've added (not replaced--added) the top seal, and while doing a test, I can hear that the unit leaks air at the top of the pump assembly.  I give up on this thing.This would be a great practical joke if it didn't cost me so much money. For less than 5 bones delivered on Prime this does the job. No problems with the lid staying tight on mine.I was asked why not just recycle using the 5-qt jug the oil came in? I do, but that's not enough. First of all I sometimes recyle ATF that comes only in 1qt bottles. Refilling those is a pain! Second I usually have 1 quart left over in the 5-qt oil jugs. I can combine these, once I have two, but then... I need to keep at least one of these available to measure removed ATF, since checking ATF levels are not trivial on most modern vehicles (warm-up, cycle through gears, etc.) Third, lawn mowers are filled from a jug but use only a quart or two, so that used oil has to go somewhere. It might be 3 seasons of mowing before the source jug becomes available.Pro tip: Build a 2x4 stand with a big funnel on top and a clamp above that. Put this jug on the base, clip your drain pan above the funnel and leave your oil bottle and filter inside the funnel and let it all drain for a day or two. That way you'll keep oil out of the dump and throw away cleaner empties. With a quick wipe you can also use it to combine jugs of clean left-over oil. 
I required an ammonia-free window cleaner for my tinted windows. This does the job quite nicely. It isn't how well it does, rather how safely it does it. This product has been proven to work well. It does what it promises to do and very well. I recommend it to anyone. Maguiar's consistently makes a wonderful product. This does exactly what it is supposed to do. This is not concourse wax - this is a CLEANER wax and it does just that. I found it to be perfect for my project. Fast delivery too. 
This is basically a manual vacuum to suck up oil or other liquids from inside your engine or other places where oil or fluids are used. It includes everything you need and works pretty well, although sicking up 4-5 quarts can be a little slow, so be patient. I use it for oil changes so I don't need to always undo the drain plug and replace the compression washer (don't forget to replace the filter too!). I've heard so many horror stories about damage to the threads on the oil pan drain plug from over tightening that I decided to reduce the number of times I go there. That's where this Fluid Evacuator comes in. Warm up the engine a little, turn everything off, slip the straw like hose down the dip stick hole and suck up the oil. Change the filer and refill the oil and you're done. For me that means I don't have to remove panels under the car to access the oil pan drain plug and I don't have to put the car up on stands. Those both take a lot of time, so this evacuator is a great time saver. The tank is big enough to hold the oil from my larger car's engine and when the tank is full, the Mityvac can be put into reverse and pump out the contents too, so you don't need to pour out the tank.It includes several different diameter &#34;straws&#34; that are designed to slip down the dipstick hole or other filler holes (like on a differential). Those straws connect to clear piping so the Evacuator can be standing on the garage floor.Remember that oil and similar liquids flow best when warm. However, don't get the fluids hot and don't run the motor with the straw inserted! I read about someone who did that and the meshing gears pulled the straw into them, causing the motor to stall and needed to take apart the engine to get the straw out!!About my only complaint with the Evacuator is I wish it had more strays since I'd also like to drain the radiators using this but don't want to use the oily motor oil straw where oil isn't wanted in the radiator. Otherwise this is a great tool to have available. Keep in mind that it does require a dip stick hole for  sucking up the oil, so if you have a newer Porsche or similar car with a digital dipstick, you may not be able to use this. Check on forums for you car if you're unsure. If you have a RV, trailer or any unit that has a waterpump in it, this is a must!!!!!!. The 2 way toggle that attaches to the input side of pump. You Then switch the toggle valve off the fresh water tank toward hose and pull RV antifreeze directly from the gallon bottle you buy at store for storing you unit before the winter. Simple follow install instructions that comes with package ( very easy to do for almost anyone)Here is how I do my units***Once installed simply move valve to direction of antifreeze hose. Make sure all facets are off before starting anything, turn on water pump switch in RV unit and I go to each cold water side of facuet**** till water/antifreeze comes out pink .....I do all cold side facets first.NOTE*You must ((((empty)))) hot water tank before storage every season or if water freezes in water tank or it will crack your 6 gallon tank and make you replace hotwater unit.Once that is complete I allow just enough antifreeze to flow to tank and out of open plug where I see pink color and quickly shut off pump. Then I turn off Hot water by- pass switch most RVS and trailers have them standard past 10 years. If you do not have one on your unit they can be installed.( if not I would have one installed Amazon sells that kit as well or you can just run enough antifreeze into tank to cover bottom where left over water will lie and freeze)Once BY-pass to hotwater tank is switched over, then I go to each hot water facuet until The water comes through pink. Do toilets, showers even outside shower if you have one on unit. I use about 1 to 2 gallons of RV antifreeze a season(ABOUT $10.00 worth to insure no frozen water lines, a small price to pay) I always allow enough antifreeze to come out of facuets to make sure the traps in drains are filled with antifreeze to cover them as well. Whole project to winterize your unit will take under 15min.!!! Its very easy for most to do and you will know its done fully by doing it yourself. I've used my Mityvac 7201 less than 10 times.  I have treated it very carefully, as I do all my stuff.  But still, it works poorly for me.The selector valve that you use to switch between evacuating/dispensing is ridiculously difficult to operate.  I can't just push or lift my selector valve to operate it.  No, I have to twist it while pushing/pulling like a madman, and hope I don't break anything (including my fingers).  I was able to loosen it up somewhat by spraying the valve with silicone/Teflon spray, and operating it repeatedly.  But (1) It's still not easy to operate, and (2) I shouldn't have to do that.The expandable plug that must be expanded to evacuate/dispense or removed to pour fluid out is ridiculously difficult to remove.  It's just a poor-fitting device.The tube connector where the main evacuation tube enters the top of the unit leaked when I put it in dispense mode.  I had to pay over $27 to get a replacement "Tube Connector Kit" (822566), since my unit is out of warranty.After replacing the tube connector and trying dispense mode again, I found that the top plate leaks.  I had not noticed this before, but it explains why it always took so much pumping when I evacuated oil!  When I use it in dispense mode now, the main tube doesn't leak anymore, but air and oil come out from under the top plate.  I removed the top plate, and sure enough, "Look Ma, no seal!"  It would be bad enough if the seal had merely failed, but for the seal not to be included in the first place is inexcusable.  Because I didn't notice this problem sooner, the seal (822821) is costing me an additional $13, including a ridiculous $8.75 fee for shipping.Now I've added (not replaced--added) the top seal, and while doing a test, I can hear that the unit leaks air at the top of the pump assembly.  I give up on this thing.This would be a great practical joke if it didn't cost me so much money. 
Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.  The pickle fork is the last resort for me, as it will damage the balljoint boot.I prefer to use the Snap On balljoint remover.  If that one cannot fit, then I will try this tool.  If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork. All the reviews and worries you might have of this product can be set to rest. This is O2 friendly so it won't mess up you cadalydic converters if you have any. I plan on buying another can next oil change. I love this funnel, it has so many uses. For example I can pour a liquid into a container with a small opening with great ease. I can hang it on a wall and it will wait there until I need to pour another liquid into a container with a small opening again. Let's see a hammer do either of those things. My hammer never stays put. You can reason with this funnel, it has an open mind so to speak. Others may try but they all fall short of the splendor that is this funnel. 
Works perfectly on engine and transmission oil drain plugs on all cars and most valve gaskets on imports.  I use this stuff any where I can on the engine to prevent leaks happening. Fits my 2002 Silverado LS 5.3L vortec RWD, extended cab. Very simple install, DON'T remove the third bolt closest to the driver side of the under dash shield, you can move it out of the way without taking it all the way off, saving you a headache trying to line the cover back up again. Doesn't have a &#34;fresh breeze&#34; smell and I can still smell the dirty air of city driving, but still a HUGE upgrade from what I had in there. Basically a pile of dirt and leaves with some filter in the middle. Air flow is superb. The good:  It adds significant security to a trailer.  The lock for the coupler latch can fit the wider models.  The lock that fits in the tongue where the hitch ball goes is easy to get on and off.Why it doesn't get five stars:1:  The lock for the coupler latch, even when lubricated and the cover on was a PITA to get the key inserted and wiggled in after the trailer was in one place for a couple months.  I was fearing that the key would break.2:  The tongue lock, it was hard to tell where to pull out the key.Would I buy this again?  Yes.  However, the lock for the coupler latch, I would throw away, and instead, I would consider using a long shackle padlock, or a lock that has an automotive-grade cylinder.  In all cases, I'd use some Tri-Flow or another locksmith-grade lubricant in all locks (NOT WD-40!) 
Used this grease on all metal contact points as suggested while replacing the brake pads.  Basically apply it on shims, where caliper cylinder the back of brake pad to prevent squealing noise while breaking.  I also use 3M silicone for the slider pins. Easy to replace. It lacks Toyota instructions, but it is exactly like existing Toyota part with all wires colored the same way so it is very obvious how to connect those.The original part has a silicone rubber tube going all the way from top to bottom with wires running inside it. This part only provides a short length of tubing that, at best, would cover half of the length of wires on my car.I thing they should provide a &#34;telescoping&#34; tubing of two diameters with one going inside of the other while you are crimping wires and then extended to cover the full length of wires This is nice and large and gets the job done.  I had no problem with hot oil.  The plastic however is very thin and the cap is pretty cheap.  The threads are very roughly cut and easy to cross-thread the cap. 
Used this when doing a valve cover gasket replacement.  o2 safe which is good.  No leaks when using this on my BMW gasket. Exact replacement for my transmission on my F-150 2001 transmission.  Use the original gasket as stated by manufacturer and drop pan and remove and insert new filter&#8230;add fluid and you're good to go Works fine, does damage the oil filter which is fine since it didn't put holes in the filter.  I was concerned it would.  But this works better than the band filter remover for my application 
easy to install with the steel brackets, good quality oil hose, and just about the right length, over 4 feet of it. I believe this under $50 cooler will save me thousand dollar in the future.Look at the picture I post on image of product.. it's got everything I needed. I cant smile enough when I use this.  If you ever used a cheap pad and then use this one you will never go back!!  Great product for everyone who wants their job done right! I get so frustrated using that &#34;blue stuff&#34; to clean my auto windows. It seems like that it does not matter how many times I clean the glass by going back over the glass time and again , I always end up with a streaked windshield. While this cleaner is not perfect and I sometimes have to go back over my initial cleaning it does do a very good job. I have both the canned and bottle spray units on my shelf in the garage and they both perform equally as well. 
Have used it for several applications besides my MAF, and will be using it on a regular basis as needed. Mitt holds lots of water and both sides can be used as it is a flat style with cuff. Perfect for washing the RV...strong pole you can scrub as high as you need to go or can leverage. Holds its position when set.  Very pleased. 
There is a large family of Goop adhesives, "All Purpose", "Automotive", "Craft", "Household", "Lawn and Garden", "Marine", "Plumbing", "RV", "Sport and Outdoor", and "Wood and Furniture"  As far as I can tell, all are identical.  Some varieties (such as Marine Goop) meant for outdoor use may be more UV resistant. So, at least for indoor use, I suggest buying the cheapest.  In the local hardware store, "Household Goop" is usually the cheapest.  At the time of this writing, "Plumbing Goop" is the cheapest on Amazon.IN GENERALGoop will bond virtually any material, including leather, plastics, glass, and metal.  The bond is clear, very strong, waterproof, and hard but flexible.EXAMPLESExamples are endless.  In addition to the examples below, I've used it to repair ceramic plant pots and shoes.  I also use it to seal rust spots on my dishwasher rack.  The Goop it also makes a "cushioned" surface that will prevent scratches to dishes.  I use Goop to close small holes in window screens.  I've used Goop to seal holes in air-mattresses.ELECTRICALGoop is far superior to electrical tape for splicing wires, re-insulating cat-chewed wires, waterproofing and vibration-proofing electrical connections.  There is a black variety of "Shoe Goop" if you want your repair to be less noticeable.PLUMBINGGoop is great for sealing small leaks (including garden hose connections, etc.).  However, you have to turn off the water, and the connections must be absolutely dry.  Moreover, it takes several days for Goop to dry to reasonable strength.  If you turn on the pressure before then you will make a water balloon.  It's better to wait a week.  Moreover, it may take several applications to get a thick enough layer of Goop to hold against normal household pressure--so a sink, toilet, etc. may be out-of-commission for at least three days waiting for the Goop to dry.SHORTCOMINGS1) An opened tube thickens quickly.  Store open tubes in a small glass jar with a tight metal lid.  Old thick Goop does not work well for some uses (such as repairing shoes), but is perfect when you need a thick application--such as insulating an exposed electrical connection or to hold pressure in a leaking water line.  It is best to start with a thin layer from a new tube to maximally bond to the surface2) Until it dries, Goop flows, alot.  Therefore a thickly-applied layer may dry to a very thin layer (because most of the glue has flowed somewhere else).  So, it may be essential to apply several thin layers (at intervals of 4 hours or longer) rather than one thick layer.  Alternatively, you can apply a thicker layer of old thick Goop over an initial layer of new Goop.  If possible, arrange the pieces you are gluing to minimize flowing, i.e., usually horizontal.  For several hours, depending on the temperature etc., the glue is "repositionable" after thickening a little, that is, you can push it back into place.  Unfortunately, if you use too many layers or "reposition" the glue too much, the result is not as attractive.3) Except when still tacky (when it can be removed with naptha or acetone), Goop is essentially non-cleanup-able.  So, for example, while it might be terrific for fixing a leaking windshield, if you mess up and your application is ugly, there is essentially nothing you can do about it.  Although Goop is terrific for repairing a broken ceramic statuette--if a little extra oozes out, there is no way to clean it up the excess.  You could simply peel/rub-off excess silicon glue.  You could simply wipe off "white glue" and clean up with a moist paper towel.4) The fumes are strong and toxic.  Allow glued items to dry in a well-ventilated area (ideally out-of-door) for several days.  When doing alot of gluing, I work in my carport with a large utility fan blowing the fumes away---and still usually get a nasty headache.  It is best to use gloves when working with Goop.TO GOOP OR NOT TO GOOPWhile Goop is truly miraculous--there are situations when other types of glue are better choices.White Glue:  For most light-duty indoor household applications which do not have to be waterproof, ordinary household white glue is much safer, cleanup is much easier, and in most cases repairs are redo-able if you make a mistake.  For example:Elmer's All Multipurpose White Glue, 7 5/8 oz. (E379)Wood Glue:  Carpenters's wood glue is essentially water-proof (when dry) white household glue.  It is much better than Goop for most wood repairs.  It penetrates and strengthens the wood.  It is much safer, and cleanup is much easier.  If the joint breaks again (because the wood is weak), it can be re-glued.  For example:Elmer's E701 Carpenter's Wood Glue 8-OunceSilicon Glue:  Silicon glue is best for glass, and when you want a truly flexible connection (for example, to absorb vibrations).  It is a better choice for general household use on glass, plastic, and metal when you do not need the maximum possible strength.  It is safer than Goop, and cleanup is easier.  Like Goop, silicon glue takes days to reach reasonable strength, weeks to reach maximum strength.  For example:GE Silicone II Household Glue, 2.8 ozEpoxy:  When you need a strong rigid workable (e.g. sandable surface) adhesive, particularly for use on metal or hard plastic, epoxy is a muchbetter choice.  For joining metal "J&B; Weld" epoxy is best.  Most epoxies dry with little running or shrinkage, and so are good for filling gaps.  Fiberglass epoxy is best for joining/filling hard plastic.  Epoxies are safer than Goop, and cure much quicker.  For example:J-B Weld 8265-S Cold WeldCLEARBOND H-3S Clear Strong Epoxy Adhesive Syringe - .85ozAPPLICATOR TIPIf you use the applicator tip, and do not use the entire tube at one time, much unused glue remains in the tip, which is wasted and clogs up the tip.  If you plan to use the glue again within about a week, then jam an old unused (uncut) applicator tip over the one on the tube, and store in a small glass jar with a tight lid.  If you aren't likely to do more gluing within two weeks, remove the tip and put the cap back on (and store the tube in a small jar with a tight lid)  If it is necessary to clean out an applicator tip, then take it off the tube, let the glue dry for several days, then pull it out with tweezers.CONCLUSIONGoop is one of those "miracle" products with a thousands uses, which needs to be a permanent part of any household.  Other such items include silicon greasePermatex 22058 Dielectric Tune-up Grease - 3 oz.painter's tapeScotchBlue Painter's Tape 2090-1E2, 1 Inch by 60 Yards, 1 Roll, and WD-40.  WD-40 Spray Lubricant - 16-oz. These are ok. They keep the water from reaching the floor, but without ridges - they also keep the water to where it hits your shoes. In and out of the car in snowy and icy conditions and you can be damn sure that you are going to end up getting freezing water in your shoes as an unpleasant surprise. They are hard to empty without spilling because of the lack of a lip on the front of the liner. So, you either wait till the water drys on its own - which doesn't happen in winter, soak it up with a towel, or attempt to empty it and end up with water exactly where it wasn't supposed to go. However they probably work fine for sandy or muddy conditions, as they are pretty easy to clean off. Overall, there are better options and I wish I had gone with one of the other options instead. This towel is very nice.  The waffle pattern makes picking up water easy.  I use thePilot Automotive CC-2010 11" Soft and Dry Water Bladeto wipe away all the big beads of water, then clean up and detail with this towel.I have found that this towel is soft enough to use to buff small spots that I missed while washing.  So, really, it's more than just a towel, it's can help clean too!  I noticed going over rubber edges around windows, that no lint is pulled off of this towel (like other ones I have used.)  Being lint-free is absolutely necessary when adding the final touch to your car.  With this towel I can finish the job right and I'm debating even getting a second one to use to give the car a final buff after it's completely dry.You'll be amazed like I was when you see how much a towel can make a difference. 
I bought these to change the tires on my GSXR. These tire irons are bigger than they appear to be. The description has them listed as small tire irons but the ones I received are 18 inches long from tip to tip and about 11.67mm thick (see pic). The thickness and the fact that these irons have a handle means you can place maximum pressure on them and they won't bend. The end has an s tip that gets under the tire and makes it easy to lift the tire over the rim. These are well made and will last a long time. Like others I have found the cover to fall short in the sizing department. I understand it's leather and unlike a comparable vinyl based product, sizing is critical because unlike vinyl, leather can't be stretched too much for a fit. This limits you to a steering wheel that is within 5mm of the product's diameter. I have tried fitting this on two steering wheels. First on my F250 and it was literally impossible. The diameter of the cover missed it by inches. Then I tried fitting this on my Saturn Vue. Now this is important, because the Vue is geared towards women whom have small hands, ergo the steering wheel is smaller and skinnier. So you would think the Vue is a perfect candidate...NOPE. I wrestled with the installation and would described it like sparring with a bear. After 10mins (not including breaks) I finally got the thing on the Vue. The result was the leather had stretched so much, it literally developed permanent stretch marks. Also, like other's who have commented in their Feedback, the wrap only made it barely halfway around the grip of the wheel. So there are now two pressure points on my hands from the front and back seams of the wrap when gripping the wheel.I gave it a rating of three due to it's exceptional quality. It is well made in the sense that its leather is very thick and the seams are well stitched. If this was right-size for my application it would have rated it Five.Part of the poor fit was my fault since I didn't pay close enough attention to the specs and prior to ordering I should have measured my steering wheels for proper fit. I mistakenly assumed since I had two steering wheels and one that is especially skinny, that It wouldn't have been a problem fitting.Take proper care with the dimensions of 15 x 1.5  Measure the girth of your steering wheel with a seamstress measuring tape. If 1.5" does not cover at least 70% of you steering wheel circumference and the wheel's diameter is great than 15 inches, you will be immensely disappointed or at the very least frustrated with the install. I underestimate the size of this level (although it was stated in the specs): I was expecting a small bulls-eye level, around 1" in diameter. This thing is 4 times the size! But regardless, it works as it is supposed to. I've contemplated mounting it to our travel trailer via the screw-holes or double sided tape but haven't just yet. I want to make sure the thing will hold up to some weathered-use before I drill holes into a metal component. Not bad for &lt;$4 (at the time of this review). 
If you leave spark plugs in an aluminum head for 100,000 miles, your spark plugs may break or the threads strip when you try to remove them.  Using anti-seize is supposed to prevent this.  If you use it, torque to the lower end of the tolerance because of the added lubrication from the anti-seize.  I never had spark plugs stuck even without anti-seize so I can't say for certain that it works but it is cheap insurance.  You can use it on any fasteners subject to corrosion. I use it for my dual back tires in a Ford 350 chassis. It would not register the tire pressure accurately. It was hard to get a tight seal around the valve stem. I will try the CH tire inflater with the built in gauge and the chuck that hopefully will get a tight seal on the valve stem. I have a possible solution for the tight-coupler problem. I used to have a Caterpillar grease gun that had to be pried off the fitting just like this gun does. It was also a heavy duty, industrial gun like this Lincoln. I like heavy duty, but there is a limit to how much force needs to be applied to free the coupler from the grease fitting. Most do-it-yourselfers have a Dremel. Dremel makes a small, cone-shaped, red-stone bit. It's head is 5mm wide at the base and 8.5 long. I don't know the item number. It is tiny. Under a magnified florescent work lamp, I lightly ground the three crescent-shaped, spring-loaded clamps that grab the grease fitting, careful to maintain the original contour. This took about two minutes. I'd lightly graze all three clamps and then test the connection. I left the coupler a little tight allowing for future wear. This grease gun is top quality. After a two-minute modification, it is now a customized tool. Guys like to customized cars, motorcycles and guns, why not their tools? I needed a tough pistol-grip grease gun to access tight places where it is nearly impossible to operate a lever-action gun.  This works for me.  Good luck. 
Great Price, good to average product with nylon string support for strength.  The hose I got seems to be quite old and dry,  But By no means is it dry rotted or usable, its just more stiff and a little ridged then the brand new stuff.  But hey it works for my purposes and that's all that counts.  I made a 12V portable fuel station that pumps 5 liters a minute that runs off my Accessories port.You can stick this hose in one tank and flip the switch and it will empty the fuel from one car into the other in short order.Also have a 26 Gal, external marine tank the I have attached a wheeled cart  to and this makes a great refueling station. The provided foam spacers and fit was perfect on my 2013 JEEP OEM hitch receiver.  Sturdy and well made.  The one I received had round corners so I did not have to 'modify' it as some other's stated they had to do.  I will not leave this permanently in my hitch and the weather, since there is potential for moisture to get into it.  If you put keys in this I'd suggest a zip log bag.  There are two holes in the back of the unit which I suspect is to allow moisture to escape, I thought about using Silicone RTV to close those up, but decided against it.  Weather, and especially near coastal areas, will probably corrode the combo lock at some point so I will not leave it permanently installed, and will keep in my cab until I need it. This Permatex Dielectric grease works great to seal out dust & dirt. I used it on my mower spark plug boots as I have a few areas of the yard that kick up a good bit of dust when I drive over them and this applied correctly makes a great seal between the boot and the plug to keep the plug clean and thus a good high spark going to the engine. If you want to use it on smaller items, you may need an appropriate applicator as it only comes with the &#34;toothpaste&#34; style opening and that's not for finesse. I highly recommend this product. 
I used to use RTV to help hold my gaskets down. Only issue with that is the next time you change the gasket you have to scrape all the RTV off to make sure you have a clean mounting surface for the next new gasket. Worse is that is you get to aggressive with your razor or gasket scraper you can scrape or gouge small scratches in the metal mating surfaces requiring you to have to use some type of RTV to help the new gasket seal the scratches you just left in the metal or risk leaks making their way through the scrapes you left behind. Get this and put a thin coat on the pan and the gasket give it a few min to set up and you'll be good. The gasket will stay in place and you will not have to worry about the gasket shifting or worse having to drop the pan again because the bolt holes for all the holes are covered by a shifting gasket. Cheapo replacement for the one I wore out.  But the tip has not cover on the metal wire wrapped around the bristles so I can pretty much guarantee it'll scratch the tire.  Until I find a good rubber tip to glue on it won't get used on my wheels.  Not worth sending back. This is not the one to buy until they fix that little tip. EXPERIENCE: JB Weld is made up of two parts, 1-parts liquid steel and 1-parts hardener. Like most strong epoxy's, you have to combined the two for the product to work. They recommend you use a clean disposable container, I used a sour cream container which I washed first.The first thing you are going to want to do before you make a JB Weld mix, is to prep the surface before application. They recommend you use Acetone or paint thinner to clean the surface, as it will not leave a petroleum film, since I didn't have any of either, I used carburetor/choke cleaner.Since the surface's were already rough, I didn't have to rough them up. However, keep in mind, if you are planning to apply JB Weld to a smooth surface, you should also rough up the surface using a fine grit sand paper as a second preparation step. I began applying JB Weld, with my cheap $1.00 painters brush from the dollar store. I applied the thick compound evenly over the entire area which meshed with the rim.Then using a piece of wood on one side of the rim, and a C-clamp, I clamped the piece on the rim with pressure and left it there for over 24-hours. After 24-hours, the JB Weld was cured and I removed the C-clamp to reveal a very strong bond! I tried to move the piece back and fourth, but it wouldn't budge, its welded like it should be!The nice thing about JB Weld, is that it can be sanded, ground down, painted, after it has been cured. I noticed JB Weld had blooped out the edges after I installed the piece. So using a dremel with a deburring tool, I managed to grind it down flush with the rim.I also used this product to seal a gas leak in the tillers carburetor bowl. It actually did as advertised and sealed the leak, there is no gas leaking out of the carb now!CONCLUSION: While I would not have believed this product could actually weld metal together, I am now a believer. If you don't own a welders kit, or have any welding knowledge, JB Weld, in my opinion, is the best product to get you out of a jam. From what I understand, this product is so good, that even mechanics admit to using it themselves! 5 out of 5! 
This stuff works. Had a flat in the middle of no where and this got me back on the trail. Works simply. You will need a valve core removal tool and a air compressor. I purchased a &#34;KIT&#34; that has everything you need. Purchased this bottle of &#34;Slime&#34; so incase I get another flat, I will have some. Just a heads up, this is meant at a temporary fix to get you to a repair place. Will last a while. This is a very useful RV product.  Some RV parks and locales require this type of product to preclude sewerage spills.  It provides secondary protection in case the regular gray or black valve has a leak.  This way, when you take the cap off, a possible leak is held back by this valve (if it is properly closed).  The unit locks on just like a regular sewer drain hose fitting.  Unlike some other brands this unit turns on its axis so that you can align the valve handle exactly where you need it. I am working on my own truck and am not a mechanic.  I have not used the pump on the truck, yet, but just tested the pump for functions and leaks.This pump has 2 functions: vacuum and pressure, which are selected with a knob on the side.  The pressure release valve has a large handle, but this makes it easy to accidentally release the pressure.  The gauge swivels, so the gauge must be fitted with an o ring.  It comes with a nice case and all the little parts has their own places.For both vacuum and pressure, nothing leaked for at least 20 minutes.For about $72.00, Mityvac beats the Lisle vacuum pump (single function and came with broken pressure release valve) handily.Even though it will be extra expense, I plan to look for a bigger container for draining brake fluid.  I bought a rubber cork stopper to see if I can make my own air tight container. 
I don't have much to say about it. Its a filter. Don't notice any extra &#34;freshness&#34; to the air. I had an old filter and it didn't smell, so this one doesn't add any extra benefit to me. I'll probably just stick to the cheaper filter next time. Definitely change these yourself. DO NOT let your oil change guys do it for you. Look up your car on Youtube and type is cabin filter replacement. I'm sure you'll find a simple step by step video on how to do it yourself. I'm guessing you'll save $30+ it stays stuck, on fiberglass at least.  easily cut to shape.  seems to protect.  i'm using it on the bellypan of my motorcycle track fairing, which is fiberglass.  i'm told fiberglass won't bubble like stock type fairings will, so i may not have needed it.  but i put it on just in case, and whether it's because i didn't need it or the stuff is working, but my paint isn't bubbling.  which is all i care about. It works well for a few days and after that I have to dump my tank and deposit more Bio-Paks. I just don't know, I may be doing something wrong. But, I don't think so because I am following the directions on the package. If any one has some tips please post them.................... 
i use this lube all around the house....door hinges, oven hinges, key locks, sliding door tracks etc.works nicely and doesnt leave a visual layer....dries invisible I use this to open my screen door without having to to open the sliding panel to reach inside to open the door.  Keeps bugs out while making the door easier to open from outside. This device attaches securely to the tow vehicle, but at a cost.They are cumbersome to attach and detach, with several moving parts and the potential to scratch the tow vehicle paint during either process if you don't have three hands available.To attain the secure vibration free fit, you must crank down on the ratcheted web strap hard enough to deform the door where it attaches to the window channel. It also deforms the rubber window seal.Foam pads protect the door somewhat where the bracket would otherwise rub on the body, but if the area isn't meticulously clean beforehand I can see where it would dull the paint over time.Because of the metal claw part that fits into the window channel, raising and lowering the window caused a screeching sound on my driver's side window.Finally, when they are detached from the door, they make for a very bulky awkward device that doesn't store conveniently or compactly in the vehicle.I'm sending them back. 
i use this lube all around the house....door hinges, oven hinges, key locks, sliding door tracks etc.works nicely and doesnt leave a visual layer....dries invisible These are ok but they make the door hard to close.  You have to really close the door hard to make sure you do not wear your batter out by leaving the door partially open. We got these to put on the RV doors.  We used one for door and they really work.  No more having to slam it shut as the springs brings the door into a closed position. 
I use K&N; oil filters on all my vehicles.  This one fits my 2000 Honda S2000.  As I don't drive it much, I change the oil and filter annually, not on mileage.  Full synthetic oil and a quality K&N; filter are cheap insurance for a 9000 RPM motor.  Glad Amazon stocks them at a competitive price.  For the Honda, easiest access is underneath, and easiest removal tool is this:GearWrench 9032 1-Inch Combination Ratcheting Wrench. Can't beat getting a filter along with the cap and O-ring for under ten bucks shipped. The Dorman replacement cap and o-ring is nearly ten bucks alone.I'm stocking up on these, as I use high-mileage synthetic oil (well, Grade III synthetic) and change the filter twice for each oil change. I also buy Mobil 1 Extended Performance and Bosch Distance Plus oil filters and just use the cap and o-ring from these AC Delco units, and I'm still coming out ahead, price-wise. I use this and change it often on a high hp application trans. The only gripe i have is the bottle wish it came in standard quart bottle to allow fit for fluid transfer pump but a cheap funnel from Walmart does the job. The Redline Water Wetter is also another good product 
fits my car perfectly, works perfectly, was easy to install. The best measure of a wiper blade is that it does what it is supposed to do, when it is supposed to do it. This product does not fit your 2012 Toyota Tacoma! That's according to Amazon.YES, IT DOES FIT MY 2012 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab.I don't know what that white powder is on the rubber seal, but I cleaned it before installing the cap.  No error codes and no gas stolen so far. I required an ammonia-free window cleaner for my tinted windows. This does the job quite nicely. It isn't how well it does, rather how safely it does it. 
This is one other item you need for your Hi-Lift jack. This allows you to lift curved bumpers, or ones without notches in them specifically for this type of jack. Great small accessory that goes well with the jack itself. Heavy duty and will last many years. I did modify this with some rubber to not mar metal finish of my bumpers though. If you have plastic bumpers, don't use this, it will leave marks. A friend of mine did that with my jack and them complained. Like it was the jacks fault he was stupid. This is metal and could scratch if you are trying to lift someone that is softer material. Comes with bolts that look too small but do the job. I added larger ones that are stronger, but the ones that come with it are rated for the correct weight loading. You need this for your jack. Will help with some fence posts of odd shape as well. I don't need to do a long review to convey the basics that this pin works perfectly to secure your hitch to the receiver.  There's a little anodized flare, and a decent little rubber cap to keep the grit out of the lock mechanism and it's stainless steel to boot!  Nice quality item. If you plan to use wheel chocks frequently, more than 2 or 3 times per year, you should consider investing in a better (more expensive) set. But, if you only need a set of chocks to occasionally do some DIY on your vehicle, these will fit the bill nicely and will not empty your wallet.They are made of hard plastic. They are not rubber, so be aware of that when you decide. However, I have used them several times to change wheels on my vehicles, and they work just fine. The little cord on them is not of much use, except for carrying them. You'll never yank them out from under a wheel (when pinched) with this little cord. A good hammer tap or kick usually does the trick.One complaint I have is that there is no "grip side" to these chocks. They are smooth plastic on all sides. There are moulded ribs on the flat side, but if you are working on a smooth surface, like a garage floor, they will not grip at all. So it is important to ensure they are tightly wedged. Some strips of rubber on the bottom surface would have been nice.Overall, they work fine if you don't plan to put them to hard routine work. 
Excellent product although contortionist skills are required for replacing this part.  After 70K miles, the old filters were completely covered in filth and bugs. Old motor home and grey cap was always a little loose for my liking. This coupled with new gate valve did the trick for me. I've always taken my Odyssey to the Honda dealer thinking they only OEM parts, but realized they are using CHAMP PH2867 filters.  It was so heavily torqued and hard to take out, I ended up using a flat head screw driver to poke a hole through the filter to remove.  The Bosch 3323 filter went on easily and hand torqued to snug fit.  It has a solid construction and I like the anti-drain valve feature to supply the engine with clean oil during cold starts.Used the following synthetic oil.MAG1 61792-pk6 Full Synthetic 5W20 SM Motor Oil - 32 oz., (Pack of 6) 
This Camco water filter works well on our pop-up camper and did make a noticeable difference in the taste of the water at the campground we stayed at. We forgot to replace our old filter and had to use the water straight out of the hookup on the first night, but picked up this filter at a local big box the next day. There was a marked improvement in the taste of the water when using this filter.We will replace this filter at the end of the season with a new one.Recommended!CFH I have a 2001 Acura Integra with slow leak out the front main seal, and a camshaft seal.  At first ( after the suggested 5 hrs ) it did nothing to slow down or stop the leak.  But after a few days, checking morning and evening for the leak, it finally stopped.  I'm completely amazed that such a product exists AND works.  Will be using at oil changes until it's time to fix the leak for good. I realized that the fuel economy had dropped about one mile per gallon. I tried this product and within a few tanks of gas. Then I now use one bottle once month when filling my tank. Try it out! 
I will keep this simple. If you want to have a "Wet Look" paint finish, this can help you achieve that.  This is how I got my 3 year old car looking like a show car.1. Wash you car with Meguiars Car Wash.  Make sure to get all the dirt off.  Dry thoroughly.  I use a super absorbent chamois to speed up the process.  Make sure to do this in the shade.  The car's surface should be cool to the touch.2. Use the Meguiars Claybar. Keep going until your hand glides on top of the paint.  This will give your paint a glass smooth finish.3. Apply Meguiars Paint Cleaner with a Random Orbital Buffer or Meguiars Buffer.  This will remove any stains and very fine swirls.4. Apply this Mirror Glaze with the Random Orbital buffer.  Wipe off and buff using a Microfiber Cloth.5. Apply your choice of Meguiars Waxes with the Orbital buffer.  I personally prefer the Meguiars NXT wax because I dont have to wait long after applying the wax before I can wipe off and buff.6.  Maintain this new finish by using the Mequiars Ultimate Quick Detailer often to clean any dust,tree sap or bird droppings that may land on your car. The Detailer will keep it lookng great and also extend the UV protection.You just need to do this entire process once or twice a year.  Regularly, you just need to wash your car at least once a week.  And you can re-apply Meguiars wax once a month or as often as you like as their waxes do not damage your clear coat.  That is why I only use their products. I highly reccomend this with the Meguiar's DA polisher,  perfect to use with Meguiars Ultimate Polish! But make sure you remove any contaminants from your paint beforehand! In the past I've ruined leather because I was not aware that household cleaners or even other cleaners that are supposedly for leather do not have the proper pH to care for leather. They end up damaging the leather and/or soaking into the pores of the leather and clogging them, making the leather tacky and shortening the life of it.This is not the case with this Lexol cleaner. It is the correct pH so will not harm leather. Further, it seems to help feed and treat the leather as it gently cleans.I have noticed a difference! The leather seems healthier after using this product for sure. Unless I hear about something better in the future, I will swear by this stuff for all of my leather furniture and car upholstery.Note, on the bottle it states - "Not intended for stain removal." So, please don't expect this product to remove stains. It's more of a general routine leather cleaner. It does clean, because when using a white cloth, I notice some dirt on the cloth while using this.Also, a tip from a leather pro I know-wait 30 minutes after using this before applying a conditioner. This will allow the leather to fully dry. 
I really like this product. It is not shiny and doesn't smell chemically like some products. (names unmentioned) It dries to a flat finish and doesn't leave any greasy feel to it like (unmentioned again).Does not appear to build up like "other" products, but, I've only been using it for about 6 months but will definitely buy and use more when needed. It is great for navigation/audio/video screens too!!! I don't use it on leather as I have cleaners/moisturizers for that, but, otherwise I use this on all but the headliner.My interior is black all over and any spec of dust shows up and is very noticeable. This stuff cleans all of the dust and anything that may have stained w/out issue. Again, no film and no buildup. The non-greasy finish is the most appealing part of this product and the smell is an added plus. As title says - waste of time, money and calories. I have 08 BMW 335i Sport. Silver color. Have long scratches similar to those that guy posted in product images. Spent almost an hour, tried all different techniques. This product simply doesn't work. If you have a new car with nice paint, I would avoid buying this. It might work for some old cars which paint is in different condition, but not for me - sorry.P.S: I bought a full set of Meguiar's paint care, you can find my reviews on other products as well. What actually worked for me (somewhat) is Ultimate Wax and Clay Kit (contaminant removal kit), Clay Kit is very hard to apply though, but it works. I've been using diluted (10 to 1) Simple Green to clean the interior of my cars for many years. It works on nearly any surface except glass.  It's also cheap and smells pleasant (at least to my unrefined sniffer).  I decided to buy this Meguiars interior detailed just to compare it with Simple Green.  I love Meguiars Gold class exterior spray detailed - the stuff is just amazing.  I also use Meguiars cleaner wax on my cars.There is absolutely nothing wrong with this product.  It does exactly what it says it should do.  I give it 4 stars for function and quality.  My gripe is that is doesn't really work any better than something 1/5 it's price.  I'll probably stick with Simple Green and skip buying this again. 
I got these for my brand new car since you do not really need to polish a new car. They work great. They pure Carnauba with no garbage added so you can rub them on any surface of your car and they do not leave a white film on, which is a huge bonus. They do give a nice shine and you really feel the protection they provide. I strongly recommend this WAX. I used this on my dark red mustang and did half the car only. I could not tell any difference. Went back and finished the car and it looked great but it look great before using this so not sure what I was gaining.By reading all the reviews I was expecting a wow factor.Maybe it does better on older cars but my mustang is not new either but in good shape.Also used it on an 09 Focus and again, no difference.Makes me wonder with these clear coats in that these products do not get down to the paint level and sinceclear coats are already glossy, a good polish does little.Not that impressed but will give it 3 stars since most people have good luck with it but my advise is if you havea car with good paint and clear coat, do not expect miracles. this is a wounderful polish and cleaner for rimms and wheeles and makes them shine and look good i highly recomend this polish to all my friends and family and customers and now i recomend it to you please try i know you will like it and will continue to use it as we shure do thanks again 
I use the applicators for more then waxing cars. They are also good for staining wood. The fome applicators work ok, but don't lay wax evenly when waxing paint. I wet the applicator and ring out the extra water. Just making the applicator damp. Apply the wax to the applicator, fold the applicator in half so the wax spreds and apply to the paint. Same way as the movie.... wax on, wax off....lol Liquid Glass is a terrific polish that goes on easily, protects for months and actually creates a deeper shine with additional coats.  I don't know if I believe the hype that many coats of Liquid Glass create a scratch resistant shell on your paint, but as a meticulous car nut, I can say that Liquid Glass is the best polish I have ever come across.  This polish goes on easily with a microfiber cloth and comes off very easily with another microfiber cloth.  It is not a wax but rather a clear acrylic coating.  I highly recommend it.PROS: Long lastingDeep, superior shineEasy to apply / buff offCan be used in sunCONS: Cannot be used over existing coats of wax/polish (unless you use LG pre-cleaner)Fairly expensiveTough to remove cured polish once appliedI posted a picture of my Liquid Glassed blue Shelby above.  Good luck. OK, must say, love my cars and want them to look great. In the last decades, I've used a huge array of the waxes out there, in the never ending quest for the perfect shine: Meguire's, (many versions) Turtle Wax, Zymol, Liquid Glass, Future 2000, Black Magic, Rain Dance, 3M, Turtle Wax Ice (paste and liquid), Turtle Wax Black Box, Mother's, Color Magic, etc. Liquid, paste, carnauba, synthetic, carnauba/sytntetic, cleaner wax, cleaner polish wax, polish wax, clay bar system, liquid clay bar. And those are just the ones off the top of my head!With that said, here are the conclusions:- I've never noticed a real difference between most any of them with respect to how the car looks after I've applied them. Put them on and the car looks great. This applies to the true waxes - the quickie things like Turtle Wax Liquid Ice, which isn't a wax at all IMHO, being the exceptions.- For most all of them, if you look at on line reviews, one will say it's the best and greatest, the next will hate it. So, VERY subjective.- Seems the more it costs and/or the more aplication effort involved, the higher it rates and the more staunch the opinions. Think there is a HUGE self fulfilling prophecy going on here;) Liquid Glass was expensive and a huge pain to apply (it looked just like any other I've used), yet it is rated 5 stars by most.- Carnauba provides the strongest protection against physical damage by stones and road debris. BUT is harder to apply and least durable over time.- Synthetic provides the most durable protection against the elements. AND is easy to apply.- God help me for saying this, but I can't tell a huge difference between a carnauba and synthetic wax job - both shine beautifully.That said, the goals of waxes/waxing is: Great shine, durable protection, less work, less needed yearly applications and reasonable pricing.So, here is the secret formula for those goals:1) Wax twice a year.2) Apply a carnauba/cleaner wax coat3) Apply Turtle Wax Ice PASTE coat - this is a good synthetic, but it's real advantage is that it is CLEAR. Not only does it not leave ANY white residue, but it can and should be used on all surfaces of the exterior - paint and PLASTICS. So, it is fast to apply/remove and it makes plastics look brand new.To the review of Nu Finish, it is a fine synthetic with the advantages of being highly rated for durability by "a leading consumer magazine" (as was Turtle Wax Ice Paste)and being easy to apply and remove - can do a whole car in like 45 minutes. BUT, it leaves the hated white residue, especially on plastics.  We're it not for that, I would have given it 5 stars - like I would most any reputable wax product out there..... 
Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.  The pickle fork is the last resort for me, as it will damage the balljoint boot.I prefer to use the Snap On balljoint remover.  If that one cannot fit, then I will try this tool.  If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork. IT WORKS I haven't really used it yet for the reason intended, changing the oil in my jet ski.  So, I can't comment on how well it works.  The main reason for this review is to put it out there that it does not work with a 2000 Chevy Silverado.  The siphon tube does not fit thru the bottom of the dip stick tube.  It would be really nice if Mityvac had a published list of what vehicles it works with and what ones it does not.  I have my fingers crossed that it'll work with my jet ski, otherwise there will be a new/(un)used Mityvac on *****'slist.  Long story short, do your research to see if you can confirm or deny if it will work with your vehicle before you buy it. 
After reading the reviews, I decided to give this a shot.  It's easy to apply and remove and smells a lot better than the Carnauba wax by mother, but it did not provide the same glossy "wet" look.  I prefer the Ca Gold Carnauba wax over this one.I have about 4 bottles of Wax and I always seem to go back to the Carnauba wax.  The other 3 are just collecting dust.Read my reviews and see pics of my review below.Mothers 05750 California Gold Pure Brazilian Carnauba Wax Liquid - 16 oz (Ultimate Wax System, Step 3) This wax can be used on modern cars' plastic headlight assy.While this is one of the best waxes available, I'm switching to Zonyl/Teflon wax as they produce much better shine. I bought this wax and also the cheaper Meguiars "Cleaner Wax". I applied both to my car..and I really don't see any shine difference. The one thing great about this wax is that it hides fine scratches well... shine wise...no difference. 
It is a good quality wax, but don't expect super shiny glossy finish from this wax. Basically it is just a cleaner wax and not anything exotic. I bought this wax and also the cheaper Meguiars "Cleaner Wax". I applied both to my car..and I really don't see any shine difference. The one thing great about this wax is that it hides fine scratches well... shine wise...no difference. OK, must say, love my cars and want them to look great.

I was suprised how well and how easy they worked even on an extended van.  It saves wear and tear on the shoulders. These filters work very well in eliminating some of the strange tastes from certan water sources.  It's difficult to judge how long to use it before replacing it, but it does work.  The Flexible Hose Protector is a piece of junk - it doesn't last that long and is difficult to use. I required an ammonia-free window cleaner for my tinted windows. This does the job quite nicely. It isn't how well it does, rather how safely it does it. 
Used to remove Nu Finish paste. Worked very well with no lint or fluff left behind. Wiped up all the polish without leaving powdery residue behind. This scratch remover seems to be more of a polish  and lube that will remove the surface scratches for the paint. It does not appear to have any &#34;grinding&#34; type ingredients in the paste.It will have little of no impact on deep scratches or deep nicks in the paint. It is easy to out on and remove and will a decent job for those light scratches. It did not remove any discoloring on my paint such as a stain left by a bird dropping. It ddi make the blemish lighter though. I used this on my vinyl deck where a protective pad for the grill had left a huge stain. The stain was removed with minimal effort. It also took some sticker residue off a plastic waste basket, the kind of residue that grabs dirt and dust if you can't get the entire label off cleanly the first time you peel it off; sometimes those labels just won't budge.Moving on, it removed a light dusting of latex paint (pale yellow) from a sealed hardwood floor, and also was handy for a pet stain on the wall (DO NOT ASK me about that stain. I'm still shuddering from the clean-up) and it also worked on the soot on the back of the glass over the fireplace.Summary: cleans evil dirt, smells divine. A must-have in my arsenal of home maintenance items. 
This towel works great on drying your car after a wash. I do need to wring a couple of times, but it does leave it streak free. Dries quick, and like a chamois, seems to work better after a couple of uses. Works just as described.  It does well by giving me a surface to loosen the dirt off my car cleaning brush, and it also allows the dirt to filter through and go to the bottom of the bucket.  Very tough also, a few times I have thrown the water out of the bucket after I'm done only to see the guard launched across the driveway - no harm to it, and just rinsed it off for the next use. The Grit Guard is no gimmick - it definitely works. As you continue to wash the car, the wash mitten will get dirty, and all that needs to be done is dip the wash mitten into the &#34;dirty water&#34; bucket, rub the mitten on the Grit Guard a couple times (front and back), and the mitten should come out cleaner then it was during the wash. For me, this has worked really well. I clearly recommend this for anyone who is serious about washing their own vehicles 
Paired it with a black frame.  Covers the plate well and will protect it from sticker stealers...  Will see how it wears over time as it is plastic and they tend to craze over time. I have used this same model cover on my bike for nearly a decade, and this is my fourth cover purchase.  They are fantastic quality and fit for the price!Storage indoors, and the cover will easily last 5+ years if you're careful not to snag it, as it will tear easily on sharp corners (mirrors, license-plates, etc.).  For the first 5-6 years of my bike's life, it was stored indoors, and one cover lasted easily during that period... where I live now, I don't have that luxury (yet).Outdoors, this cover will keep your bike dry and protect it from harmful UV damage for at least two seasons (mine started to fall apart after 3-years of year-round, outdoor coverage, but I also coat it annually with Camp-Dry to increase water repellent ability and UV protection).  The elastic does start to give out after a couple of years, but still holds the cover securely on the bike in high winds.Sizing:For sizing, The XL fits perfectly (slightly snug around the license plate and rear turn-signals) over my 1100cc Honda Sabre with 19" windshield, large saddle-bags, and small tour-pack behind sissy-bar.  This XL fits exactly the same as the XL made 10 years ago, with the only exception being the snugness around the license plate and rear turn signals... I'd be happier with an extra inch or two of material back there.If I had to buy again, it would be a toss-up as to the XL or XXL.  My last one was an XXL and it was very loose-fitting, which caused it to flap in the wind, catch wind under it, and sagged in heavy rain, which created places where water would "pocket" on top or droop to the seat-level, eventually soaking through the material.  The XXL also covered (almost) all the way to the ground, which meant more chances of getting it dirty at the bottom or having hot pipes/engine touching the black material (not the heat-resistant silver).Design Change:The newest version of this cover also does not have silver running 360-degrees around the cover, as in the picture.  The black material of the top now covers down to the front wheel, and the silver starts right behind the forks.  This does help you to find the front of the cover in poor lighting, and actually looks much better when on the bike.Cons:My only real issue is that the material of the newest version of this cover is slightly thinner and more "nylon-feel" than "cloth-feel" of the ones made 10 years ago (or even five years ago), and the cover does not have the full Nelson-Rigg logo... missing "More than just a Bike" wording below the logo... no biggie, but having the full logo does make it easier to find the "front" of the cover in the dark :)  I do not believe the thinner feeling material affects the cover in the least, as mine has successfully kept my bike clean and dry during heavy snowfalls and torrential downpours over the past three months, and still looks like NEW.  We'll have to see about longevity... but if it lasts 2-3 years in outdoor conditions, I'll not be complaining!Update 6-8-14:When putting the cover on my bike today in anticipation of rain, the cover ripped as tension was placed over the windshield and mirrors.  The rip was not bad, but very disappointing to spend $40 on a cover that has barely held up to 6-months of use and very mild weather!  I will be contacting Nelson Rigg to obtain a replacement under warranty! Have had these for almost a year on my '13 JK Wrangler. They do a great job in keeping the door frames from getting scratched up and ruined. The glue strips are easily used on the back, by pulling off the protective paper coating, just place them onto the door jam, and hold in place for a moment. They stick in place even without the doors being on the Jeep for most of the year! 
I was looking for a good microfiber towel and as Meguiar fan, I read the reviews and decided to purchase this good product. I used it after the clay bar, polish, glaze, sealant and wax and it did a excellent job. Meguiar's Deep Crystal line is meant as an inexpensive alternative to the more expensive Meguiar's product lines.  This liquid wax works very well, and contains Carnauba, but is not their best product.This product is Step 3 in the Deep Crystal line, and would be used after Step 1 (Wash) and Step 2 (Polish).  The product is applied by hand or dual action polisher then wiped off after it dries.  Very simple and effective.The "look" of this product is highly subjective, but it does not have the clarity or longevity of other Meguiar's waxes.  It should also be noted that this product has been discontinued, so don't get too addicted to it!  If you want a great carnauba wax from Meguiar's, look into Gold Class Carnauba Plus. I love taking care of my vehicles.  I have used many expensive, imported products over the years.  However, Meguiar's keeps winning me back with their incredible offerings.  They are of high quality, effective, easy to find, and affordable.  However, take the affordable off.  I'd use their products, if they were 3x the price because I've used products that cost that much and are less effective.Meguiar's NXT Generation Tech Wax 2.0 highlights that experience.  I didn't want to like this wax/sealant as much as ones I paid thirty, forty, or fifty dollars to buy.  However, the results were obvious. On my vehicles, this is the best wax/sealant I have ever used.For optimum results I strongly encourage you before apply NXT 2.0, clay your car, clean with a paint cleaner (i.e. Scratch X or Deep Crystal Step 1), polish with a pure polish (Deep Crystal Step 2 or #7 Show Car Polish), and then apply this wax.  The results are truly remarkable.To maintain your shine, remove loose dirt and contaminants with Quick Exterior Detailer, or Ultimate Exterior Detailer.Meguiar's keeps delivering the good stuff, and I'm a fan. 
Even draining a 911 (~10 qts of oil) this has the capacity. It's not flimsy at all, and the large lip keeps the oil where it belongs. Draining out the spout requires a lot of maneuvering and twisting, like getting a smooth pour out of a beer boot, but it's not really a problem. Still deciding how I feel about the bright green, kind of fun, but doesn't look brilliant once it's full of dirty oil. A little tall, which makes low spaces (under a motorcycle) a little trickier. Overall it's the best oil pan I've yet owned. Still have issues with old MH. Can't seem to get the grey tan clean, but it is old. This work great and seem to be fast. Like the clear to see when nothing else is left. This is need for all serious RVers. This is a GREAT product (what isn't from Mothers honestly??) to buff up and polish plastics.  I used this for my upper third brake light for my ranger and it took the dull hazy out of it and made it nice and shiny.  Used it also on the plastic on the gauge cluster and it made it nice as well.I would NOT use this to polish the headlights... get a kit that is DESIGNED for headlight restores, that is a multistep process...etc.  This has minor abrasives but once buffed out leaves the plastic with a nice smooth almost deep finish to it.  I'm sure it has oils to put back into the pores of the plastic.Overall a solid product to bring back some life in dull and worn looking plastic pieces.  Plus it doesn't break the bank...Thanks,-Nige 
I have a brushed titanium finish bike with polished aluminum components, and this polish works well on both metals.I also used it to polish the brushed stainless steel exhaust tips on my car, with very good results. This drain works good but is starting to corrode. It really should be made from stainless steel or even plastic. I use this stuff for all kinds of metals that I need to shine up. Mainly use this on my Ruger Mark III Hunter, it is all stainless steel and this stuff really cleans/polish's very well, a little goes along way. 
Used this on a black Dodge Charger with clear coat and the sparkly paint.It did a good job of removing finger nail marks under the door handles and minor scratches where things were dragged over the back bumper to put them in the trunk.It did not harm the clear coat.I would buy this again. I had sanded off part of the clear coat around my wheels to deal with some curb rash I had gotten. I had previously used &#34;Bleche White&#34; as my wheel/tire cleaner, and it didn't effect the bare aluminum on my wheel. This stuff does, it left weird white tarnish marks all over the part with bare metal. I can get it off by sanding further with fine grit sandpaper and then polishing with metal polish, but it's really annoying.That being said, it really cleans your tires and wheels well. Better than &#34;Bleche White&#34; for sure, but I will probably stop using it for my car because of the metal corrosion issue. I have a 1998 Ram pickup that spends its entire life outside, parked near trees.  I hadn't done much with paint care for more than a couple years and one side was covered in small, hard, brown tree sap spots.  Reading the reviews on Amazon (and other websites) for clay bars and their use in cleaning up paint surfaces, I thought I'd try this Mother's kit to revitalize my paint job.  I was sceptical about its abilities to do anything other than a final "fine cleaning".  I was right.The clay bar could not remove any of the hard tree sap marks.  It does not remove scratches (and can actually apply some if you do not keep the clay lubricated.  It does make the paint seem smoother to the touch, but I cannot tell the difference between a final normally waxed and polished surface and a clayed waxed and polished surface.  The surface feel of unpolished paint Vs clayed paint does exhibit a noticeable benefit from claying, as the makers claim.  However, applying a good polish achieves the same results on a washed and clean paint surface, in my opinion.  Even on my truck, after cleaning it first, the clay stayed pretty clean and only after doing the whole vehicle paint surface did the clay feel faintly gritty and appear slightly darker in color - ready for trashing.To remove the sap, I resorted to a rag soaked in mineral spirits and plenty of elbow grease.  To eliminate any light scratches, I used T-Cut.  Then I clayed it, followed by polishing with Turtle Wax.  After a day of that, my shoulders ached bad, but the truck paintwork looks good; well, as good as an 11 year old, well-used, stone-chipped and scratched truck can.  The clearcoat has actually held up exceedingly well over the years.I haven't tried clay on our 3 year old, garaged minivan yet.  It will be interesting to see if it removes minor swirl marks.  I don't expect it to make the paint look any shinier after polishing. It looks great as it is.I did buy an extra bottle of detailing spray (I bought the kit locally at Autozone) in case one wasn't enough.  But one was enough for one clay bar / one vehicle treatment.  Since there are two clay bars in the kit, then the extra bottle will be used with the second bar.I found the claying to be easy and quite quick.  I split the bar in two, then pressed it flat into a disc about 2" in diameter.  Then I sprayed the surface and rubbed the clay back and forth over the paint in my palm.  Knead it regularly back into the 2" disc, as it gets thinner and splits.  It was actually very straightforward and no big deal.  Avoid rubber parts, like the windshield surround, as the clay picked up black "soot" from those.  Make sure you polish it dry as the spray leaves streaks if you don't remove it with the supplied towelI suggest clay bars are really for the guys and gals that want the ultimate care for their newer vehicles.  It may not be noticed by anyone else, but it's the satisfaction of a job well done that always matters to the perfectionist!  I know 'cos I am one!Sept 26 2009 UPDATE:  This evening, I tried claying half the hood of my minivan then waxing it all to see if I could tell any difference.  The clearcoat on the van is in great condition.  I washed the hood and dried it.  Then I clayed the left half (LH as seated in the van).  I did notice that even with plenty of spray lubricant there were a few faint straight line, light scratches visible in the clearcoat after I wiped the surface dry that weren't there before claying.  I could not feel any real difference in the surface smoothness from the clayed to the unclayed side. The clay appeared to have no visible dirt in it.  I then Turtle Wax'd the whole hood.  After that, the straight line scratches were gone and there was no VISUAL difference from clayed to unclayed even with the reflected overhead flourescent light from my garage as a guide.  I then applied my dry finger tips to the hood; left hand on the unclayed side and right hand on the clayed side.  Applying a light pressure and sliding back and forth, I think I detected a slight reduction in friction as the fingers change direction on the clayed side.  Even swapping hands over, the result seemed the same, ruling out differences in my finger tips!  However, the effect was so slight that it was almost imperceptible.CONCLUSION:  Claying may help with a contaminated paint surface to remove those last little imperfections and revive the paint, but with a clean and regularly-waxed paint surface, claying probably isn't worth the cost nor the effort. 
with plastic bumpers being the norm, thought I'd use this plastic polish.  It brings the shine to the plastic painted areas just like step 2 does to the metal. The plastic is very good quality, the brush does a great job...not much else to say...no complaints. I prefer using a brass scraper as it won't scratch the glass as easily as plastic (this scraper WILL scratch paint/glass if you aren't careful). This rotor seems OK, but the original is held in place by a screw that is under a plastic dust cover.  So, how do I remove the rotor? 
Works as advertised. I haven't really used it yet for the reason intended, changing the oil in my jet ski.  So, I can't comment on how well it works.  The main reason for this review is to put it out there that it does not work with a 2000 Chevy Silverado.  The siphon tube does not fit thru the bottom of the dip stick tube.  It would be really nice if Mityvac had a published list of what vehicles it works with and what ones it does not.  I have my fingers crossed that it'll work with my jet ski, otherwise there will be a new/(un)used Mityvac on *****'slist.  Long story short, do your research to see if you can confirm or deny if it will work with your vehicle before you buy it. Does exactly what it's supposed to do,fit low and snug on the filter cover. To work with good tools can make the task a miserable experience or a sense of accomplishment.Recommended for sure! 
This is designed to work with the Valterra bayonet fitting on your Gray or Black water dump valve and it does just that... Works Great all you have to do is just spray it on and that's it , it foams up and lubes the seals . This does indeed store plastic bags - a few. It is small enough to fit on the inside of cabinet doors on my RV but it really doesn't hold many bags and leads to the obvious question - &#34;Why spend the money?&#34;. However it does work as advertised. 
A bit tough to insert the key into the hole as the towing light outlet on the left is partly in the way.  It's manageable to lock and unlock, but you have to do it at a slight angle and/or wiggle it in.  The black makes it look hidden and matches nice. When I saw at the picture online I thought they were reflective, like a mirror finish, but they were just light gray, with a darker fabric on some of the sides. They fit the window fairly well, with only a small area in the bottom middle of the window where light gets in. It does help a little with keeping the car and steering wheel from getting too hot while sitting in the sun. Its better than using nothing. This device attaches securely to the tow vehicle, but at a cost.They are cumbersome to attach and detach, with several moving parts and the potential to scratch the tow vehicle paint during either process if you don't have three hands available.To attain the secure vibration free fit, you must crank down on the ratcheted web strap hard enough to deform the door where it attaches to the window channel. It also deforms the rubber window seal.Foam pads protect the door somewhat where the bracket would otherwise rub on the body, but if the area isn't meticulously clean beforehand I can see where it would dull the paint over time.Because of the metal claw part that fits into the window channel, raising and lowering the window caused a screeching sound on my driver's side window.Finally, when they are detached from the door, they make for a very bulky awkward device that doesn't store conveniently or compactly in the vehicle.I'm sending them back. 
I got the yellow can to give my fog lights a vintage european look. I got the exact perfect color. Very pleased. The vinyl film you can buy is not the perfect amber color, but more of a cheap china lemon yellow. And the film reduces the light output by 20 % and is a pain to apply. Still, I needed 12 coats to get the tint I wanted. And you can only apply 5 coats in one hour. After that, according to the instructions, you must wait 7 days to add more coats. If your oven can go as low as 170, you can cure the paint for 90 minutes in the oven and then apply more coats. It doesn't  smell that bad. At the end, I got tired and tried to go heavy on the paint. Not good. It runs and you have to use 1500 grit sand paper to fix it. Not too bad, but still. After all that, I put 4 coats of Dupli-color clear wheel paint for extra protection. I know, they are just fogs and it's just a car. I guess I wanted memories of my youth when fog lighs were amber like they always should be. This is great wax! It truly deserves the Gold Class name. I use this after the Meguiar's Ultimate Polish. I also have migrated to a 6 in buffer/polisher. I used to do all of my polishing and waxing by hand, and with the buffer, this turns out great. I have an 89 LeSabre that is Black Sapphire in color. Before using the polish/wax combo, it looked more like a darker blue. Nothing really deep. After polishing and waxing, it now looks like the black in black sapphire. It looks great in the shade, as it should and looks beautiful in the sun. There is a nice deep, glassy color, and I am pleased with the results. The water also beads very nice, too. First, as with all of the Dupli-Color Metalcast paints, if you want the metalcast effect, you'll have to use the Dupli-Color Metalcast Ground Coat (MC100) on the surface before you apply the color or it will not come out right. The can says that it also comes out the same if you're painting directly onto chrome like surface but I have not tried this so I don't know. Now for this green. I'm more of a blue and purple guy for dark colors so only by my personal preference do I say that this green comes out just a tad light in color for me. Overall though, if you use the ground coat this comes out great with a nice metal sheen. I recommend this product. 
I've long been a fan of Liquid Glass LG-100 Ultimate Polish, but due to lack of supply I settled for this 3M Performance Wax. This wax is much easier to apply than the Liquid Glass & leaves no mess.  No residues, no powders & it does not stain the plastic (molding, door handle, trims etc).Only noticeable difference is Liquid Glass does leave a thicker coat of protection than this 3M; however, only time will tell which one last longer after repeated car washes.  So I will update a few month from now. this stuff applies very easily and it lasts a long time. I use spray wax to make it last even longer.synthetic stuff is the way to go.. This 32 ounce is much cheaper in the long run than the kit with it's little bottle of cleaner. Most people use more of the cleaner than the oil. One properly serviced K&N filter will last as long as the car will last. I have never had to replace a K&N filter. Just clean, air dry with a fan, recoat the filter fabric with the oil and a thin film of K&N grease on the seal. The oil has a red dye in it, so you will know when you have full coverage. The K&N filters catch dirt better than any of the paper filters. 
I will keep this simple. If you want to have a "Wet Look" paint finish, this can help you achieve that.  This is how I got my 3 year old car looking like a show car.1. Wash you car with Meguiars Car Wash.  Make sure to get all the dirt off.  Dry thoroughly.  I use a super absorbent chamois to speed up the process.  Make sure to do this in the shade.  The car's surface should be cool to the touch.2. Use the Meguiars Claybar. Keep going until your hand glides on top of the paint.  This will give your paint a glass smooth finish.3. Apply Meguiars Paint Cleaner with a Random Orbital Buffer or Meguiars Buffer.  This will remove any stains and very fine swirls.4. Apply this Mirror Glaze with the Random Orbital buffer.  Wipe off and buff using a Microfiber Cloth.5. Apply your choice of Meguiars Waxes with the Orbital buffer.  I personally prefer the Meguiars NXT wax because I dont have to wait long after applying the wax before I can wipe off and buff.6.  Maintain this new finish by using the Mequiars Ultimate Quick Detailer often to clean any dust,tree sap or bird droppings that may land on your car. The Detailer will keep it lookng great and also extend the UV protection.You just need to do this entire process once or twice a year.  Regularly, you just need to wash your car at least once a week.  And you can re-apply Meguiars wax once a month or as often as you like as their waxes do not damage your clear coat.  That is why I only use their products. I use the applicators for more then waxing cars. They are also good for staining wood. The fome applicators work ok, but don't lay wax evenly when waxing paint. I wet the applicator and ring out the extra water. Just making the applicator damp. Apply the wax to the applicator, fold the applicator in half so the wax spreds and apply to the paint. Same way as the movie.... wax on, wax off....lol Yes, there are waxes that will last longer, bead better and possibly shine more.  However those waxes require lots of prep work.  Who has time to clay, polish and then wax?  The beauty of a cleaner wax is it cleans, polishes and protects.  Sure, you can buy a more expensive wax, slather it on, and the car will look great... until the next rain or wash.  The wax will wash off and you'll be left with dull paint again.  The reason a new car looks so good is because the paint it polished and free of oxidation and continents.  This wax will get you back to that place.Pros:-Strong cleaning action-Good polishing action-Very easy to use-Huge value for the $Cons:-Stains trim-Not as durable as some-Needs to be applied in shadeIf its been a while since you've waxed or you have a car that is parked outdoors 24/7, you'll be hard pressed to find something that works better for the amount of time you put in.  Remember, thin is in, no need to glob this stuff on, just use enough for the applicator pad to glide on the surface.  Work it until the paint feels smooth and move on.  Allow to dry for 10-15 minutes and wipe off. 
This product is a MUST have for anyone who does any type of electrical work (automotive, motorcycle, marine, etc) as it stops any corrosion from starting up or protecting a cleaned up connector... It does exactly what it's supposed to do. No problems whatsoever. Does what it says it does......looks great !

Allow to dry for 10-15 minutes and wipe off. For the price, you will not get a better quick detailer, nor a better investment to protect your car paint.  For me, "quick detailers" were a little confusing in their use and purpose.  So for those of you who don't know, they are meant to be used for two basic purposes:1) To protect your car's clear coat/paint.  Ideally you use this between waxing to maintain both the glossy newly waxed look as well as protection from the elements. The hydrophobic properties (water beading) serve as a visual reminder of that protection.  It's not as good protection as a full waxing and it doesn't last as long, but again, it's effective to prolong wax protection.2) Act as a cleaning agent.  This detailer can be used to get rid of a variety of stains.  I personally have used it to get rid of everything from caked in bird droppings on the hood to road splatter near my wheels.For me, I use it as a protectant only for touch ups on certain areas or after I clean up a stain.  I don't really use it on my entire car as a "pseudo wax".  The simple reason is that for you to safely do that, you really need to fully wash your car beforehand.  Otherwise, without a hose and car soap, you risk actually scratching your clear coat with all the dirt/debris while you apply this detailer.  And if you wash your car, then it's just not that much more difficult/time consuming to apply a wax right after (vs using this detailer), which is better protection anyways.  Although one time saving is that in waxing you need to buff out your car after applying it, which can take some effort to do properly whereas you do not with this detailer.  If you do wind up applying this on large areas of your car, just remember that you should try to keep it dry for 12 hours for the detailer to fully cure to maximum protection.However, as a cleaning/protectant for spot stains this is indispensible.  It's extremely effective and I always keep a bottle of this in my trunk because you never know when a bird is going to do its business on your car and you need to get those type of stains out as quickly as possible before they corrode your clear coat.Hope that helps! 
Have used a California Duster for over 15 years on brand new and old car finishes, from black to white. This duster keeps a relatively clean, maintained car looking show room shiny and takes only minutes to use. How many things out there can give you a spiffy shine in a couple of minutes?The key to using the Duster is to follow the clear instructions provided. You MUST let it dry out a day or two before initial use. It has a waxy coating on the fibers (all the more reason it DOES NOT scratch the finish) and it has to dry out before initial use. Have read a couple of reviews that claim the Duster scratches, but suspect it is because they didn't let it dry out. The one time I forgot to do that, it looked liked it scratched (scared the daylights out of me!), but it was just swirls on the surface from the moist wax - easily removed. And, if there is moisture on the car's surface, it too will look like a swirl or scratch until it dries.Second, it is is a DUSTER, NOT a scrub brush. Only to be used on finishes that are otherwise clean but have dust/pollen on them. If you scrub with it to remove mud, splotches, bird droppings, etc., it WILL scratch, just as dry rubbing a car's finish with ANYTHING will scratch it. You let the Duster do the work, lifting the dust right off the car. Doesn't just push it around, but actually lifts it off.Maker claims it only gets better with time and dirt, but of course can't figure out how that could be true. BUT, have never noticed any problem with use and dirt accumulation. Tried washing once, which maker says you can do, but seems to remove the waxy coating and defeats the effectiveness. Ya, it may last forever, but I buy a new one once a year - hey it's pretty inexpensive.Be the envy of neighbors, get one of these and be as amazed as they will. So i applied this according to instructions and wiped it off with dry cloth like it said, but the surface was sticky and left white resedue that i cant wash off. cleans very well removes brake dust and stuck on grime..need to spray on and let soak scrub with brush..hose off..if stains are old or been on rims for awhile you will have to do a second clean but it will remove 95% of grime 
Wish it were cheaper, but I won't use a product that might damage the paint on my classic - so I pay the price.  Only reason for not giving it another star is how much it costs.  Using a stretched out 2x3 inch piece of clay along with the Meguiar's Detailing Spray for lubrication makes pretty easy work for a step that I'm not that fond of doing.  I'm always shocked at how much garbage the clay picks up from what looked like a clean paint surface.  The smoothness after going over the paint shows that this stuff is working great.  Cleaning the car with soap and water is the first step, and using the clay is definitely the necessary second step before moving on to polishing and waxing. If you are going to wax your vehicle (which you should about twice a year in a cool spot in the shade) you should evaluate the clear and if it has a lot of swirl marks you should consider polishing the car and then waxing it. I like to do the mothers three step process polish, micro polish, and wax but i still had some of this so i used this as step one. This is the only clay bar kit I've used, so I can't compare it to others, but based on the results, all I can say is "Holy Cow"!  I've been washing and waxing my cars for 20 years, usually using a 3-step system (cleaner, polish, wax), and I usually get pretty decent results.  But I've heard so much about claying, I had to give it a try, and I'm glad I did.On my 2006 Honda Pilot with 100K+ miles, I washed and clayed first and was amazed at how much smoother the paint was.  I then tested a panel with Meguairs' Ultimate Cleaning Compound, and it did make an improvement, so I "cleaned" the car, then polished (Ultimate Polish) and waxed (Ultimate Wax), using an orbital polisher.  It took a few hours, but the results are astounding.  The paint is literally (not figuratively) smooth as glass.  I don't think it even felt like this when it was brand new.  The mirror finish is incredible.So if you've never clayed your car before, don't hesitate.  Just be sure to use lots of the included Quick Detailer for lubricant.I found the Meguiar's kit to be very good.  I broke off about 1/3 of the clay bar and that got me through half the car, then I used another 1/3 for the rest (including the windows).  So assuming that was the proper amount, I should be able to do 3 cars with the 2 bars in this kit.  Watch a few of the YouTube videos showing how to clay (including "folding" the clay when it becomes dirty) so you know exactly what to do. 
This product does work well and leaves your car looking great, but it is very hard to wipe dry. The instructions state to wipe on, then using dry side of rag, wipe dry, but I'm finding it difficult to get it to wipe dry. You only need a few things to get your home detailing kit started and the Grit Guard is at the top of the list. If you are doing a 2-bucket wash then Grit Guards are 100% necessary. No questions asked.For those that do not know what a Grit Guard is, this little device sits on the bottom of your wash/rinse buckets and allows dirt and sediment to drop into the bottom of your bucket. After you wash a panel you rinse your wash mitt in the RINSE bucket and rub the mitt along the Grit Guard on the bottom. This helps knock dirt out of the mitt so you can have a clean mitt to wash the next panel of the car. The little fins on the bottom of the Girt Guard help keep the water from swirling and disturbing the dirt that has settled on the bottom of the bucket.Necessary Items for Home Car Wash:1. 2 Buckets2. 2 Grit Guards3. Microfiber Wash Mitt (I recommend 2 - one for top panels, one for bottom)4. Car Wash SoapThese basic supplied can get you started. Once you get a basic wash kit then I guarantee you will want to expand and look into microfiber towels, waffle weave drying towels, clay bar kit, wax, etc. A great product for those who stay in areas / condos where a water hose may not be available. Can be used as a clay lubricant and quick detailer in higher concentration. If your vehicle does not have lot of grime and mud etc which needs to be hosed off this is an ideal product to get. Good for regular cleaning between waxing. Does not strip off wax or sealant. Great water saver. Keep a few microfiber towels handy to dry the vehicle, take care to rinse clean the cloth as you work. 
Excellent product.  Does exactly as it's supposed to.  Just don't be a moron like I was and pay attention to the direction of the arrows and think about how the water will get sucked from the bottle.  I had mine connected backwards for about 30 minutes until I figured out why it was not sucking anything from the anti-freeze bottle.  Once I corrected my mistake, it worked like a charm.  Definitely a must-have for any rv'er especially one that lives in the north. So I bought this to replace my 20 year old, kicked around, same version of this gauge.  I had suspected my old one was not reading properly.  So I got this new one.  I am happy to report that the 20 year old one reads exactly the same as this new one.  So now I have a spare to keep in my other car.  The only thing I don't like about this model vs the old one is my old one had a little release valve. So it holds the needle where the pressure reading was till you press the release.  Very handy.  And it was my fault for not noticing it wasn't there on this new version.  Overall, I couldn't be happier with this product.  If you have a car, and have tires, and want them to last, having the correct tire pressure matters. Great product. I've had it a couple of months and have already used it twice. This has lots of power and holds a charge for a long time. I highly recommend this product for jumping almost anything. I't s a little heavy and it tips over easily but those things don't affect performance. 
3M knows how to make sandpaper. When you get to 2000 grit you're really polishing. I use this prior to polishing something. I got these to use on my leather clothes and car seat. Very cheaply made. The white lint from the pad comes off and is a mess to pick up from leather clothes and car seat. Go to dollar store and get microfiber cloth ! I'm not sure what they make this with, but this towel works great and is very soft to the touch.  I'm buying for my other cars. 
This is by far the best brake controller I have ever used in 30 years of towing. Has a wide range of tow setting to accommodate different trailer weights. I wouldn't use anything else! I have been using this product for years and it has never failed me. I now have one in each car for emergency purposes. It is noisybut strong and durable. It's the second time, I've used this product on my Mitsubishi Eclipse v6 5sp. I highly recommend it for everyone to use it. 
This does not only protect, but cleans stains, road film etc. off the paint and bring its to nice clean shine. My cars have ranged from light colours (white and silver) to darker colours (red and blue) and this works perfectly to clean and protect. Sometimes, depending on how dirty the paint was,  2 applications would be done to restore the finish. Safe on clear coats and glass this is perfect. Also, one heavy shower does not remove the wax. Give it a try. If you use the metalcast ground coat like you are instructed to do the metalcast smoke paint is "transparent" and looks fantastic. Lately, there seems no difference between polishing compound/rubbing compound. The latter used to refer to very coarse material but this no longer seems true.I use this compound mostly on plastics and it can remove residual adhesive, scratches, etc... It can also be used to polish clear coat layer on metallic paint. Paint whatever with metallic paint first, then spray a few layers of clear paint (gloss). Wait a day or two to completely dry and lightly polish with this compound & soft cloth. You'd be happy with the result. 
Too hard to empty into a small mouth container like a gas can. I store old oil in an old plastic 5 gallon gas can and empty when full this pan is a bear when directly trying to fill the can. I have to use a funnel which is just another item I need to clean. Make sure you find a bucket where this can sit somewhat snug at the bottom.I used a standard sized bucket (the kind you get at your local home improvement store).. everytime I fill the bucket with water, the grid guard will invariably float up off the bottom.That said, it's handy to scrub your wash mitt against to trap dirt from washing, but I'm not overly thrilled with this product. Bought this along with a No Spill 5 gallon can to use for track days. THe length is excellent and gets down into the filler of your car. It also fits in a 1 gallon freezer bag so you can seal it up and put it back in the trunk when done without smelling gas or getting it on your trunk carpet. Two improvements would make this a 5 star funnel. 1) It should be slightly upturned at the opening to catch gas as it backs up 2) The diameter of the nozzle should be larger and it easily could be given the tank inlet size - would allow faster filling. 
This is a Very Good product I bought a New 2013 KIA RIO and bugs and Dirt and Grime get on those Plastic Headlights, and Small Scratches. this is a Very Good product I have found that When you clean the plastic with mothers glass cleaner and then buff by hand this stuff into the lenses it helps with the bugs and scratches. I was impressed with this spray cleaner. It cleans very powerfully and with ease with virtually no scrubbing or scraping. It seems like it would be stronger smelling or have fumes becasue of its strength but it is mild and non-toxic and biodegradable which is amazing to me. I used it to clean my daughters overdue bathtub and I am use to having to use abrasive cleaners and scrub the tub but this cleaner cut right through the grime and it basically wiped away with no need for heaving scrubbing. I am impressed and look forward to trying it on other tough jobs. I will be a repeat customer of this product. Yes, there are waxes that will last longer, bead better and possibly shine more.  However those waxes require lots of prep work.  Who has time to clay, polish and then wax?  The beauty of a cleaner wax is it cleans, polishes and protects.  Sure, you can buy a more expensive wax, slather it on, and the car will look great... until the next rain or wash.  The wax will wash off and you'll be left with dull paint again.  The reason a new car looks so good is because the paint it polished and free of oxidation and continents.  This wax will get you back to that place.Pros:-Strong cleaning action-Good polishing action-Very easy to use-Huge value for the $Cons:-Stains trim-Not as durable as some-Needs to be applied in shadeIf its been a while since you've waxed or you have a car that is parked outdoors 24/7, you'll be hard pressed to find something that works better for the amount of time you put in.  Remember, thin is in, no need to glob this stuff on, just use enough for the applicator pad to glide on the surface.  Work it until the paint feels smooth and move on.  Allow to dry for 10-15 minutes and wipe off. 
I required an ammonia-free window cleaner for my tinted windows. This does the job quite nicely. It isn't how well it does, rather how safely it does it. I received the valve on time and it was very well packaged. I have installed the valve and it works very well on my RV hot water tank. works well 
Some hardware stores carry this in 8 oz. containers.  It is a buck or two cheaper to order it here and have it delivered.  It works better than naval jelly.  Not particularly recommended for show quality applications.I pour a little our on a 2&#34; paint brush to coat rusted ferrous metal.It stops rust and turns it black.Good for tools and equipment that have a tendency to rust.It is thicker that some of the phosphoric acid products and leaves a coating that can be painted over.I am using it on a rusty utility trailer and an old tractor.You don't have to paint it but you can.It kills the rust. Bought this to try out because Royal Purple gets such rave reviews.  There are two 20W50 formulas from Royal Purple, but I had a hard time discerning what the difference actually is, so I got this one (cheaper).  Compared to Mobil 1 20W50, my motorcycle runs hotter and the valve train makes more noise.  After about 2500 mi., I drained it out and put Mobil 1 back in.  Much better.  Also, the oil causes the engine to produce a "sweet" smell.  This is normal according to Royal Purple and due to its formula, but, mixed with exhaust, it smells awful.  My bike doesn't burn oil... it's just the smell Royal Purple is associated with.  I don't like it.  Also, Royal Purple oil new is very dark (and dark purple).  Mobil 1 is the standard synthetic light brown/amber color.  At least I can tell with Mobil 1 that the oil is contaminated - it turns dark, not starts dark.  Not a fan, and will use the rest of my bottles in the primary or hand it over to friends who are willing to trust it.  I'm sure it's fine, but not for me. Does a super job on brass, copper, silver, aluminum, bronze and stainless steel. Polishes most metals to a mirror-like finish. Very similar to Flitz polishing cream.

Nice anti-seize, brush on bottom of lid, reasonably sized tub, will last years and years for casual home use. I've so far used it for my vise recondition and some bicycle stem bolt threads. This wax has provided a durable, high gloss finish to my 2004 dark blue metallic GTO. I wax the upper surfaces every 3 months and the rest of the car every 6 months. If you use this wax regularly and garage your car at night, you won't ever need to use a cleaner product. I have 2 lawn mowers for summer and a snow blower for winter.  I have used Sta-bil for years in the gas can which I use for these machines for over 10 years.  The lawn mower sits around for months with gas in it over the winter.  Using Sta-bil prevents the &#8220;gum and varnish&#8221; residue that can be left behind when gasoline evaporates.  No need to drain the mowers or blowers every season.  The engines usually start right up after having been left idle for months.  Sta-bil has worked me and I will continue to use it.

Does a super job on brass, copper, silver, aluminum, bronze and stainless steel. Polishes most metals to a mirror-like finish. I've been using this polish for many years and would definitely recommend it. These worked great to lift my car - very stable and sturdy, and I like that they were made in the USA.  A quality product. 
I use two of these when using a spray wax after each wash, one to apply, another to buff.  Very good quality as it does not scratch my black trucks.  However, they are not thick and for using on a pick up, you should use a set for each side and then one for the roof/hood (six cloths) if you are the type that is very particular on your vehicle shine.  If not picky, one set would work fine. I have used this solvent a number of times to remove adhesive and badging from my cars.  For that it works wonderfully.  When used modestly it does not effect automotive surfaces or glass.  Since this stuff is so potent, I would recommend using the the spray straw in the nozzle so that you can more carefully target where you spray this stuff.  You want to be very careful where you put it.  It also evaporates rapidly so you need to work quickly when you use it.Just to reinforce a few precautions:- Do not get this on plastic (it will discolor it) or any soft/organic materials.- Do not use around high eat, as it is extremely flammable- Limit all bodily exposureOverall this is a wonderful product, just be very careful how you use it. I use this stuff for all kinds of metals that I need to shine up. Mainly use this on my Ruger Mark III Hunter, it is all stainless steel and this stuff really cleans/polish's very well, a little goes along way. 
Easy to install. I used my own screws because of the material that I was mounting the bracket on. I had to tape one of the light adapter plugs as it was a loose fit in the bracket. This hitch extension is &#34;adjustable&#34; because it has two holes on the &#34;male&#34; end of the receiver, and two holes on the &#34;female&#34; end.  Depending on how you insert this extension into your vehicle (hole one or two), and how you insert your bike rack or whatever else into the &#34;female&#34; end (hole one or two), there is some adjustment on how much extension you achieve.  In theory.I was hoping to use the SMALLEST amount of extension with this so that I'd achieve about 7&#34; of extension.  I needed to extend my Thule T2 bike rack just enough to clear a larger-than-factory Jeep tire.i am able to use the hole that positions this extension furthest into my Jeep (so the &#34;male&#34; of this extension is adjustable).  Unfortunately, I was not able to utilize the deepest hole in the &#34;female&#34; end of this extension because there is only about 2&#34; of space between that deeper hole and an internal ridge where the inside square bar is welded to the outside square bar.  Hard to describe, but essentially my Thule bike rack it the back of this extension before the holes lined up with the deepest hole in this extension.So.. I suppose you could blame that on my bike rack?  In hind sight though, I wouldn't trust any bike rack that only had that little amount of metal behind the holes--just not enough there to handle the load.  No.. I think that this extension could have been better designed to just have ONE hole on the &#34;female&#34; end, but position it somewhat in-between the two that it currently has.  I doubt that there are many racks out there that could utilize the deepest hole in this extension's &#34;female&#34; side...One additional comment.. I read some reviews that criticized the welds.  I am not a welder, but in my observation, the welds seem smooth and uniform all the way around this.  I must say that the metal is a little thin compared to other extensions that I've seen.  I think it's quite fine for any 2-bike rack out there, and I'm using it for that.  When I set up to carry 4-bikes, I do worry that this may snap though, and I am pursuing another extension for that reason.Conclusion:  If you are only carrying 2 bikes, and you are happy with the extension possibilities IGNORING the deepest hole in the &#34;female&#34; part of this extension, I recommend it.  The price is reasonable and the integrated locking bolt is really nice (especially if you buy their optional locking bolt.)If you want a very short extension, this probably won't work.If you plan to carry 4 bikes, I don't know if this is strong enough.  I'm using it for that occasionally, but I'm a little worried about it... It bothers me when front license plate is screwed directly to the bumper.  Considering the cost of these mounting brackets, I wish manufacturers included them as standard equipment; it would show their attention to detail.When I found Cruiser Accessories 79150 Mounting Plate it seemed like a good value.  I especially liked multiple slots for mounting onto the bumper.  These slots provide a good number of mounting and adjustment options.  I used the upper two vertical slots because they were spaced exactly like the existing holes in my car's front bumper.Unfortunately, there was a couple of frustrating issues that spoiled the experience:1.  Four screws that are included with the plate are too long.  I saw them being long and I am glad I checked for this before installing the mounting plate onto the front bumper.  I used included four screws to attach the license plate and the Black Cruiser Accessories 20050 Classic Lite frame to the mounting plate - screws' sharp tips protruded 1/4" from the back of the mounting plate.  If I had installed the mounting plate onto the bumper first and then tried to attach the license plate with the included screws, I would have damaged the front bumper in two places (the bottom two holes ended up over an air intake slot on my car).  I expect all pieces included with the product to be carefully engineered for that product and working properly.  These screws, obviously, are of the wrong size.  The fact that I had to go to Home Depot to find properly fitting screws not only was frustrating, but also increased the overall cost.2.  The thin pieces of plastic at the top and bottom of the mounting plate are too flimsy.  When I unpacked the plate, these areas of the mounting plate were slightly deformed: bent inwards. Fortunately, the license plate covered the problem.When the mounting plate is installed, it looks nice, so I am not completely disappointed; however, I found a similar product from Bell at Autozone, and it was cheaper (though Bell's mounting plate had very long screws too). 
These caps fit on top of the Tri Lynx levelers (Tri Lynx 00015 (10)  Lynx Leveler) or by themselves, for under stabilizer jacks or the hitch jack (if you have a light trailer).  They can also be used on top of the levelers, for under the tire(s) to level your RV.  I don't know how much weight they can bare, but they do well with my 3,400lb trailer for all of the uses described above. Perfect for washing the RV...strong pole you can scrub as high as you need to go or can leverage. Holds its position when set.  Very pleased. Great tool for clamping hard to reach radiator hose clamps.  Its multi-position locking mechanism will make sure to clamp and hold various sized clamps- unlike other pliers that can only hold in the fully close position. 
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. Great Fit These item does fit perfect on my 2004 BMW x3. does what its suppose to do. so far so good thanks 
Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlander 
Installed on a 2006 Acura MDX and it was painless... worst part of the install was getting out the interior panel holders as I did not have the proper tool. I have installed several hitches in the past and this is the first one that I have ordered that did not include a ball mount... This review would have been 5 stars if I didn't have to go out on my own and buy the ball mount as well. Didn't have it listed as included but I just bought a Curt mount for my Lexus GS350 which one was included... Lesson here is if you plan to install and use on the same day order a ball mount as well. Install was a total PITA!! The bolts holes used to mount the hitch itself were rusted to no end (2005 MDX) and the ONLY way for me to get the bolts in was to use one of the old ones that held up the tow hook you remove and using that as a thread cutter with WD-40... I also used an old round plastic brush and brushed the threads with lubricant as well!! Install took almost 5 hours due to this unforeseen problem. Purchased these before we actually owned the 2014 Jeep Unlimited Sahara. Simple install. Does what it is suppose to do. 
This doesn't fit my 2007 Toyota Tacoma factory hitch.  It needs to be 2 7/8".  The package on this lock reads 2 5/8 but I measured it at 2 3/4.  I'm going to have to grind the bolt.Update, Jan 2014.  An noted I had to grind the inside ends to make this fit in my Tacoma OEM hitch.  Once, it was ground to the proper length, I spray-painted the bolt and have used it to haul a 19-foot trailer and attach my tow hook ever since with no further problems. 2013 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Sahara: Used this to extend a Bluetooth adapter to the glove box of my Jeep through the dash panels. Now my knee won't smash the Adapter and with the plug head being shorter I don't hit this either. Works just as I had planned. I purchased this belt for my 2003 Chevy Tahoe. I had no idea Chevy would put 2 serpentines on a newer generation vehicle. This smaller belt fits the A/C system only. It works like a champ and fits perfectly. I would recommend the Gatorback belts to EVERYONE! As an installation side note, you have to remove the air intake and larger serpentine to get to this "bottom of the motor" mounted unit.... way to engineer that one GM! 
Don't buy this rear wiper for a 1st generation xB, it will NOT fit! Get OEM or a wiper from elsewhere!

Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.  The pickle fork is the last resort for me, as it will damage the balljoint boot.I prefer to use the Snap On balljoint remover.  If that one cannot fit, then I will try this tool.  If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork. bought this to use with a signal generator, and works great.  does just what I need.  will buy another if needed. The product works very well based upon condition of your interior. It will not make your car new, but it does work. Hope this helps.

First, as with all of the Dupli-Color Metalcast paints, if you want the metalcast effect, you'll have to use the Dupli-Color Metalcast Ground Coat (MC100) on the surface before you apply the color or it will not come out right. The can says that it also comes out the same if you're painting directly onto chrome like surface but I have not tried this so I don't know. Now for this green. I'm more of a blue and purple guy for dark colors so only by my personal preference do I say that this green comes out just a tad light in color for me. Overall though, if you use the ground coat this comes out great with a nice metal sheen. I recommend this product. First off, don't get turned off by the name, Yellow is the color of the stuff, it won't turn your paint yellow!  It does look great on yellow paint though, also reds and darker colors like dark blue and black.  For lighter colors you are better off going with something else, Collinite 845 is a great choice.Pros:-DRIPPY wet looks.  You'll want to grab a towel and dry your paint, its that wet!-Decent durability, approx 2-3 months on a car parked outdoors-Fills in minor swirling-Leaves paint nice and slickCons:-Stains trim (rubber, black plastic)-Needs to be applied very thin, otherwise it can be hard to take off-Can streak if used on a hot surface or if too much is usedOverall, this is a great wax that has been around for a very long time because it looks so great.  its a total steal at the price. I have a dark colored car, so I purchased one of those "black" tinted spray waxes which claimed it also cleans and shines black plastic and metal trim.  Wrong.  I also use a regular (not black) liquid spray polish detailer.  It's okay on regular black plastic and window trim surfaces.But neither could clean the paste wax residue ruining the look of the textured black plastic on top of my rear bumper.  But Mothers Back-to-Black certainly did.  Now my car looks showroom new again.The product is a cream colored liquid (not black).  So my product applicator (an old sock) and my wiping cloth (an old t-shirt, both from my husband) aren't stained.  I'm very happy and I would I highly recommend this product to everyone. 
This scratch remover seems to be more of a polish  and lube that will remove the surface scratches for the paint. It does not appear to have any &#34;grinding&#34; type ingredients in the paste.It will have little of no impact on deep scratches or deep nicks in the paint. It is easy to out on and remove and will a decent job for those light scratches. It did not remove any discoloring on my paint such as a stain left by a bird dropping. It ddi make the blemish lighter though. cleans very well removes brake dust and stuck on grime..need to spray on and let soak scrub with brush..hose off..if stains are old or been on rims for awhile you will have to do a second clean but it will remove 95% of grime I assumed this product would work much like 409, meaning a rating of "useless" in the garage.Working on cars, I do try to avoid using the strong, chemically aggressive automotive solvents. Generally, you want the weakest solvent possible to adequately dissolve the unwanted material, while leaving the surface underneath intact. KK's "natural/biodegradable" formula seems to make it particularly effective at dissolving grease and oily buildup, which are also natural in origin, but leaving surfaces unharmed.Off to the garage.. I needed to clean the firewall cavity of a car, which included organic slime from old leaves, but was mostly covered with a layer of dense, greasy dirt - a combination of the endless supply of airborne grit from the road and the oily vapor residue of the engine compartment. KK did an admirable job, basically dissolving the bad stuff and leaving the painted metal and insulation, and rubber sealing grommets, intact and shiny. Most areas only needed one application and a wipe.You do, however, need to rinse off anything that is bare metal, especially (less dense) aluminum. I overlooked a couple of drops when rinsing an aluminum air intake plenum that I cleaned up. The next morning, I noticed some corrosion having developed at those locations. So, rinse well when you are cleaning metal, since KK is not chemically inert. Also I need to give a particular nod to its ability to clean up rubber hoses. Unlike using most water based solvents on rubber, which just smear the dirt along, it lifts the grease and dirt up, which then gets absorbed into your rag/towel and leaves the rubber clean and supple.KK covers the entire range of cleaning duties between the many water-based solvents that can't handle dirt-infused grease and the extremely destructive chemical power of carburetor cleaner, which will begin to dissolve rubber, plastics and paint. Plus, it doesn't even smell bad. Two thumbs, way up. 
This works on par with mothers showtime spray lubricant and as final once over the car so it's perfect.  Good for using as a pad lubricant when cutting, polishing, and waxing. I used this with the Porter Cable buffer & Astro Pneumatic 4607 5" PU Velcro Backing Pad to apply Meguiar's Ultimate Compound and it worked great on paint that was oxidized and it was easy to clean the pad. I own my own detailing business and use this product exclusively for three purposes.  1. As a clay lubricant for paint contamination removal and 2. Putting the finishing touch on vehicles that are freshly painted and/or have had recent body work.  I love the fact that it's body shop safe, and 3. Prepping my polishing pads.  Otherwise, for anything else I use Meguiars synthetic spray detailer that wipes off even easier and has the added benefit of putting a protective "film" over the vehicle.  Another great product by Meguiars. 
Mitt holds lots of water and both sides can be used as it is a flat style with cuff. We use these to put color logos on the inside of the plate for display on the front of the vehicle. Back ground can be painted in on the inside of the plate for better contrast. The material seems durable, but it does not fit tightly on my 30x9.5x15.  There is almost no elastic properties for the interior, and it would easily spin on the tire itself, and stealing it would be ridiculously easy.  The bottom looked like granny panties on a supermodel.  Couldn't see that delightful bottom curve.I used a grommett kit on it so I can thread a rope around it to cinch it tightly.  Has faded to a charcoal gray from black since purchase 18+ months ago. 
I never thought of using paste wax, I used the liquid version of this wax, I was very pleased with the results, but the paste was way easier to use. The container comes with an application sponge which can be stored in the tin. It was less messy than liquid, I can never go back to a liquid now. I'm not sure about the durability of the wax, but since I use a spray wax regularly and a good detailer.....dirt has no chance of stickin to my car's paint.I will buy this wax again.

Another great product by Meguiars. I've used Meguire's cleaner wax for over two decades. The protection and finish are great. What I really like about this wax is that it does not create a build up, as using other waxes like carnuba can do over time.Reading some of the other reviews is frightening! Please don't mistake the work "cleaner" to mean a substitute for actually washing your car!! The cleaner function removes previous wax and oxidants... but you need to carefully WASH your car before applying this, or any other polish or wax. 
I used this pad with the Porter Cable buffer and Astro Pneumatic 4607 5" PU Velcro Backing Pad to apply Meguiar's Ultra Finishing Polish and it worked great. This pad is easy to clean. I use these pads for final polishing and sealant application.  Yes, I flat out love these pads.  Oh yeah.After washing and cleaning the paint surface with the proper compound, I follow up with Ultra Cut and sealant, both of which I apply using this pad.  Surface prep listed below:1. Wash with Meguiar's Gold Class Car Wash.2. Clean surface with Ryobi, 6&#34; orbital sander and 6&#34; terry cloth pad combined with Meguiar's &#34;Ultra Cut Compound&#34; or &#34;Medium Cut Cleaner.&#34;3, Polish surface with Ryobi, 6&#34; orbital sander, with Hook-Loop Velcro strips attached to pad and polish with &#34;Ultra Finishing Polish&#34; applied using a 6.5&#34; soft foam polishing pad; the yellow 6.5&#34; foam pad.4. Finish using the yellow, 6.5&#34; soft foam polishing pad.  The Synthetic Sealant goes on very easy and with a micro cloth, comes off equally easy and leaves a very satisfying shine.Warning: due to splatter factor, make sure to smear Ultra Finishing Polish and Synthetic Sealant onto the surface before turning the dual action (DA) buffer on.After taking the time to wash and clean the surface of the paint with Ultra and/or Medium Cut Compound, applying Ultra Finishing Polish and Synthetic Sealant to the paint is pleasure as with this pad, it goes on very nicely.(all compounds, polishes and sealants are removed with clean micro fiber cloths.)In my opinion, for final polish or sealant application, these pads are the bomb. After buying the Meguiars DA Polisher and the "frequently bought together deal" including the 6.5" finishing pad and the 6.5" polishing pad I found out directly from Meguiars that they have updated the pads to 7" which include a recess to make centering the polisher's backing pad easier AND have improved the Velcro backing pad adhesive so that the new 7" pads are actually machine washable.  The Velcro pad is attached far more securely.  The older 6.5" pads often lose their Velcro backing due to washing/cleaning.There is no doubt in my mind that the pad material is of high quality on either the new 7.0"  or this older 6.5" pad, it's just that Meguiar's has improved and updated their pads now.  The recess on the back of the pad definitely aids the user in centering the pad, that one feature alone makes buying the 7.0" pad a no-brainer.  Combine that with the improved backing pad adhesive and now we have a slam dunk.Here are the links for the newest and improved pads:SOFTBUFF 2.0 FOAM POLISHING PAD 7 inchMeguiar's W 9207 7" Soft Buff 2.0 Foam Finishing Pad 
I realize that there are testimonials for this product actually doing what it says it will do.  I have not had an occasion to need it in an emergency.  AND - I hope that I never do.  It does not inspire confidence.  It feels like something that would be included in a child's toy tool set.  Extremely lightweight.  Directions state you must hit the window in a specific location - good luck with that in an emergency.  I was hoping for a tool with enough weight, which added to acceleration, would break the window.  Again, I have not used it, and I will not trust it in an emergency - so I will be looking for a better product.  I do not recommend this item...at any cost. I did order these for a banding tool, but had to return them because the bands I use don't work with this tool. Although that being the case, these are a well built tool and would probably be the stuff when used with the correct type of band. I am reading lots of bad reviews on these pigtails.  What worries me the most is some seem to be shipping with a different thread type and people are stripping them trying to make them work.  Why the heck can't these be standardized?  I've also read that some come with different sizes of NPT as well as different thread types.  It seems that what is listed is not always what you order, and on top of that, someone like me, who does not know how to recognize the different thread types and sizes won't even know if I received the correct part or the wrong part.I recommend you double check your part number on the hose before installing them to avoid stripping your regulator.I thought, why not use quick connect hoses to connect my regulator to my appliance.  It seems these mate up nice to other quick connects--but only if made by CAMCO, and then these quick connect fittings don't mate up easily to the other parts like regulators etc.  WTF?  I need still another adapter?  And some people tell me perhaps multiple adapters to make it all work?  I'm not going to use three different adapters to mate up a quick connect.  That means I have a huge lunking thing sticking out ready to be damaged, knocked out of place, that is sure to leak out all my expensive propane.Ok, so I called CAMCO.  I wanted to be sure I ordered the right part and spoke to two different people at CAMCO that blew me off.  It seems Camco parts don't necessarily fit each other.  And they don't sell adapters to make them fit. It would be great if they could provide some customer support and perhaps make up some custom hoses to help people make things work.I give this a 1 star because CAMCO's huge fail in helping me put together a system that will allow me to hook up external tanks to my RV.One star also, because they ship different types of hose fittings and buyers don't know what they are getting.Honestly, I'd like to order one of every one of their parts and analyze them.  I'm an engineer, and if I can't figure out what to order, based on conflicting information--reviews that report receiving different size fittings 1/4&#34; npt than specified 3/8&#34; npt, and a multitude of part numbers--and a need for adapters when a buyer should be able to buy everything he or she needs without an adapter---it all tells me CAMCO has not thought out how their products are used.Think about it, there are only so many way propane tanks, hoses and appliances are hooked up. I don't see any need for adapter other than those that attach to the tanks. 
I will keep this simple. If you want to have a "Wet Look" paint finish, this can help you achieve that.  This is how I got my 3 year old car looking like a show car.1. Wash you car with Meguiars Car Wash.  Make sure to get all the dirt off.  Dry thoroughly.  I use a super absorbent chamois to speed up the process.  Make sure to do this in the shade.  The car's surface should be cool to the touch.2. Use the Meguiars Claybar. Keep going until your hand glides on top of the paint.  This will give your paint a glass smooth finish.3. Apply Meguiars Paint Cleaner with a Random Orbital Buffer or Meguiars Buffer.  This will remove any stains and very fine swirls.4. Apply this Mirror Glaze with the Random Orbital buffer.  Wipe off and buff using a Microfiber Cloth.5. Apply your choice of Meguiars Waxes with the Orbital buffer.  I personally prefer the Meguiars NXT wax because I dont have to wait long after applying the wax before I can wipe off and buff.6.  Maintain this new finish by using the Mequiars Ultimate Quick Detailer often to clean any dust,tree sap or bird droppings that may land on your car. The Detailer will keep it lookng great and also extend the UV protection.You just need to do this entire process once or twice a year.  Regularly, you just need to wash your car at least once a week.  And you can re-apply Meguiars wax once a month or as often as you like as their waxes do not damage your clear coat.  That is why I only use their products. Liquid Glass is a terrific polish that goes on easily, protects for months and actually creates a deeper shine with additional coats.  I don't know if I believe the hype that many coats of Liquid Glass create a scratch resistant shell on your paint, but as a meticulous car nut, I can say that Liquid Glass is the best polish I have ever come across.  This polish goes on easily with a microfiber cloth and comes off very easily with another microfiber cloth.  It is not a wax but rather a clear acrylic coating.  I highly recommend it.PROS: Long lastingDeep, superior shineEasy to apply / buff offCan be used in sunCONS: Cannot be used over existing coats of wax/polish (unless you use LG pre-cleaner)Fairly expensiveTough to remove cured polish once appliedI posted a picture of my Liquid Glassed blue Shelby above.  Good luck. I use the applicators for more then waxing cars. They are also good for staining wood. The fome applicators work ok, but don't lay wax evenly when waxing paint. I wet the applicator and ring out the extra water. Just making the applicator damp. Apply the wax to the applicator, fold the applicator in half so the wax spreds and apply to the paint. Same way as the movie.... wax on, wax off....lol 
This unit works well.  I used the supplied foam mounting tape and overnight the unit fell off the wall.  I remounted it with 3M foam tape and it has not moved in several months.  I would not mount it over a vehicle using any type of mounting tape. I used this with the Porter Cable buffer & Astro Pneumatic 4607 5" PU Velcro Backing Pad to apply Meguiar's Ultimate Compound and it worked great on paint that was oxidized and it was easy to clean the pad. i tried it on a superficial scratch, and kept rubbing the product several times, and reapplied 3 time and scratch is stil there, i tried it with foam pad, microfiber pad, microfiber towel, worst product meguairs produce. 
I use these sponges to apply leather cleaner an leather conditioner to my car.  The are absorbent and can be rinsed out for future use.  They are soft and supple and gentle on the material you are cleaning and conditioning. These are good microfiber clothes to use.  I use them when cleaning and waxing the boat. they work as expected, very soft and absorbant. This pad and the yellow polishing pad are perfect. Cell foam material is durable, wash and reuse. This pad worked perfectly on my Home Depot's Ridgid Random Orbital Sander with the hook and loop pad. Don't spend $140+ on a so called "car" random orbital polisher. The Ridgid is basically the same thing...yet only costs $60 and I can use it for home improvement work after my car is done. Meguiar's Scratch X 2.0 also works good with this pad to remove minor scratches and blemishes. Use Ultimate Compound for heavier oxidization. 
Great product and works well. However the Manufacture as a limitation on the packaging of not for DA (dual action) sander/buffer. I called and they said it only applies to this cutting pad and not the Finishing pad.... With that said I have used the pad with a DA buffer.... They said it will not hold up. I have no problem with it on a Porter-Cable DA. What is not to love about a cheap genuine K&N; product?  It fit in my car with zero issues and its K&N; so you know its quality.On a nice side note for the men out there,  K&N; includes a sticker to put on the air box that says the filter is a K&N; product and does not need to be replaced.  I only say this because my wife has had people who change her oil try to sell her a new one.  This was a nice thing to see in the package.  They even include a card to put in the glove box with a 1 800 number for a service station to call if they don&#8217;t believe it!I have always put a K&N; air filter in my car and as long as they are around I always will.  Plus Amazon had them for about 30-50% than other places I looked.I have no issues! Camco makes good items and this is no exception.  A durable and well fitting cap.  I would buy one again if I needed it (had to type at least 5 more words for my review, butt hey are true). 
Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars Works great, nice to have a second cable, but the OBD end of the cable is angled.  In my case, this cable won't work on my Subaru Outback.  I would prefer the option of a straight OBD connector.  Note that the angle connector works on my other four cars (Mazda, Honda, Dodge). Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. 
They are nothing fancy, some basic terry cloth sponges.I used them to apply waxes and leather care products.I own many fine leather items. When I need to clean them to remove grime and stains, then I prefer to use a terry cloth sponge, rather than a microfiber cloth. When I condition the leather, then I use the microfiber cloth which is much softer.I didn't have much problem with the lint issue, maybe Lexol improved these pads....?I washed them and they held up fine.But I do have to say, I prefer the Viking cotton terry sponge applicators better as those ones have a denser foam and are softer to the touch. In addition, I think the price for these Lexol pads are not such a good value, considering that one pad cost about $2.10. The Viking ones are much better value.... This product really works great for any type of rubber/vinyl/plastic.  However, this item was purchased for a specific purpose, when you detail a car no matter how good you are you will get some wax splatter in places that you never intended, ie rubber weatherstripping, this stuff will take dried wax splatter off perfectly.  Highly recommend this product and highly recommend this item for any detailers bag.Advice use this product ASAP on dried wax, do not let the wax become sun baked!Also perhaps you'll have better luck than I, but I have yet to have one of these bottle arrive intact from Amazon, bottles are usually leaking contents upon arrival. I bought these to use with the Lexol Leather Cleaner, Conditioner, and Vinylex products.  Does what it is intened for and they're washable for reuse. 
I assumed this product would work much like 409, meaning a rating of "useless" in the garage.Working on cars, I do try to avoid using the strong, chemically aggressive automotive solvents. Generally, you want the weakest solvent possible to adequately dissolve the unwanted material, while leaving the surface underneath intact. KK's "natural/biodegradable" formula seems to make it particularly effective at dissolving grease and oily buildup, which are also natural in origin, but leaving surfaces unharmed.Off to the garage.. I needed to clean the firewall cavity of a car, which included organic slime from old leaves, but was mostly covered with a layer of dense, greasy dirt - a combination of the endless supply of airborne grit from the road and the oily vapor residue of the engine compartment. KK did an admirable job, basically dissolving the bad stuff and leaving the painted metal and insulation, and rubber sealing grommets, intact and shiny. Most areas only needed one application and a wipe.You do, however, need to rinse off anything that is bare metal, especially (less dense) aluminum. I overlooked a couple of drops when rinsing an aluminum air intake plenum that I cleaned up. The next morning, I noticed some corrosion having developed at those locations. So, rinse well when you are cleaning metal, since KK is not chemically inert. Also I need to give a particular nod to its ability to clean up rubber hoses. Unlike using most water based solvents on rubber, which just smear the dirt along, it lifts the grease and dirt up, which then gets absorbed into your rag/towel and leaves the rubber clean and supple.KK covers the entire range of cleaning duties between the many water-based solvents that can't handle dirt-infused grease and the extremely destructive chemical power of carburetor cleaner, which will begin to dissolve rubber, plastics and paint. Plus, it doesn't even smell bad. Two thumbs, way up. Works just as described.  It does well by giving me a surface to loosen the dirt off my car cleaning brush, and it also allows the dirt to filter through and go to the bottom of the bucket.  Very tough also, a few times I have thrown the water out of the bucket after I'm done only to see the guard launched across the driveway - no harm to it, and just rinsed it off for the next use. Speeds up the fresh water tank fill process.  It also speeds up filling the portable water jugs during dry camping.  It's really convenient to be able to turn the water on/off right at the jug. 
The results are the same you would get with similar products from other brands. The shine stays for a few days only. The bottle, however, looks way better than those of competing products. I've used this product many times in the past but each time I did it was the small bottle included with the filter that I used. This stuff is exactly the same as the smaller bottle and therefore works the same, which is to say very well. You spray it on the filter, let it sit for 10 minutes or so and rinse with water. There are two benefits to the larger bottle. First is that it is more economical. I have four vehicles with cotton oiled air filters and this bottle should last a fairly long time. Also, it is much easier to spray into the filter than with the smaller bottle. I also feel because it is easier to spray and direct you will use a little less cleaner your filter which should make it an even better value yet. I bought this item to use with my clay bar, this bottle is larger than the bottle that came with the Meguiars claybar kit. Works great...though I noticed the color of the product was diffrent from the smaller bottle from the Meguiars Clay bar kit. Both works the same...good price too.Pretty good product for quick detailing. 
Bought this and kit to install for use on tubeless tire motorcycle (Kawasaki C14 Concours)Used product on flat and was very easy to use and stopped the leak (had to use 2 plugs for a #10 screw hole)Hole did not leak for about 50 miles and then started to lose about 2 psi a day.Would recommend for roadside tire repairs, Also would suggest not for long term use for non simple nail / tack type tire repairs.OEM Package no great to store un used plugs after package opened. Someone suggested using tin foil to wrap the un used plugs once package opened.Would buy again for road side tire repair. Would not buy if you expect a permanent, safe, long term repair... just use product to get you home or to the repair shop. Got it for over a year period of time but never got a chance to use it till 2 weeks ago...The engine check light turned on in my VW. Plugged in this code reader and got one OBII Error code. Googled the OBII Error code and found that was something to do with bad catalyst conveter. Checked my manufacturer warranty policy and found that the emission (catalyst converter) warranty would be expired in 2 weeks!! Rushed the car into VW dealer. VW dealer confirmed the catalyst converter was bad and I got free fix and replacement for the catalyst converter.Really happy that this small OBII code reader helped me to understand the source of the problem. Highly recommended. This kit was easy to use.  Removed years of neglect on my newly acquired truck.  Removed a great deal of contaminents from the paint. 
This is very handy to have around the house.  Works on any glass surface and truly makes it look invisible.  Just spray and wipe away in straight lines with a towel.  Works well on car windows too, and is safe to use on tinted windows. I have tried at least 4-5 different beam wiper blades on our cars.  I've never found much difference between them except with installation.  As for functionality, the same is true of this brand of wiper blade.  It works well and does a good job clearing water.  Like other beam blades, it sucks water from the vertical edge of the driver's side windshield back into your field of view.  Otherwise, there's no skips or streaks left behind.  The biggest differenced I noticed with this brand is that it was a bit louder and occasionally squeaked when working, especially in very light rain or with a semi-dry windshield. The C-18-UB Countour Blade fits my husband's 2006 Honda Accord on the passenger side.  The ANCO C-22-UB Countour Wiper Blade fits my 2010 Honda Odyssey on the passenger side. Installation was super quick.  I didn't need to use adapters or anything.  Just make sure to tug it to make certain it is on correctly.  Otherwise, it will come flying off.  Ask my boss about that story.The blade itself is a single unit.  This gives it a low profile and it's very attractive.  The blade is curved to wipe the windshield evenly.  The technology really works.  I tried it by having my daughter spray the windshield with a water hose head set on sprinkle, like rain.  I didn't see a single streak.  Great wiper blade. 
This scratch remover seems to be more of a polish  and lube that will remove the surface scratches for the paint. It does not appear to have any &#34;grinding&#34; type ingredients in the paste.It will have little of no impact on deep scratches or deep nicks in the paint. It is easy to out on and remove and will a decent job for those light scratches. It did not remove any discoloring on my paint such as a stain left by a bird dropping. It ddi make the blemish lighter though. Paint was thick and didnt spray on very even at all. Was trying to tint fog lights and just didnt work. Not to remove scratches, but to conceal and and make look presentable. It works well and does what it is supposed to do. Great for light scratches. Harder to use on black cars, but with a little patience it works well. 
My screen door is metal insert and this closure kit will not work to close it without major modifications. Cannot recommend. The manufacturer could be clearer as to where and how this works because I see a lot of RVs where I live where this type of device is useless and people waste money buying it. My vehicle: 2004 Honda (Acura) TL 6-SPD J32A VTEC.The originals were made in the USA but these are made in Japan by NGK, or Nippon Touki (Japan Porcelain).  Iridium-tipped plugs are generally used on reciprocating powerplant-equipped airplanes.  Incidentally, Iridium/Platinum plugs are generally pre-gapped at factory and do not need re-gapping (some exceptions apply).  If re-gapped incorrectly, the tip would be damaged. Any tech should have one of this when recommending replacement of a customers tire. Some states require you have this for state inspection. 
The Tender Jr. does not come with a cigarette adapter so I cut this in half to make two. I purchased 2 lighter plugs for a buck each from China&#8230; with free shipping&#8230; and they are working fine. These aren&#8217;t an exact match with the Tender cables but they fit together OK and are easy to determine polarity with the wire colors. You can also just use this as an extension cord for your Tender. The description states a length of 12-inches&#8230; but it&#8217;s actually 14-inches tip-to-tip on the connectors. Nice item for the price and it&#8217;s made in Mexico. a regular 32mm socket will not fit in the space of my equinox. this is a kind of shorter 32mm socket designed only for oil filter cap job. it works fine. This is a plastic sandwich type holder for the flat 4 wire connector.  Not only did my connector fit loose and tilt at an angle as a result, but the holder did not have a proper channel to fit the cover for the 4 wire connector I just bought. The channel provided for the cover is very small and is evidently application specific. This was a waste of money.  I had to buy a different mounting bracket from a trailer place. 
I like them - YES the KC is bigger now than it was on older models of the guards IT IS AS SHOWN IN THE PICTURE and  I LIKE IT.They provide some protection - not a lot  but they do look good.I actually saw another set of these today on a Toyota FJ and thought how good they looked on the black lights they had. Then I saw a CJ with the old style ( there were aged ) the KC was smaller and the guards were holding up well after the years of use it was obvious they had. Bought this to replace an older model that apparently grew a set of legs and walked out of the old tool box. Anyway its a handy little gauge and seems to be built just as well as my original one. Much better and more accurate than using coins... had a friend install the horn. replaced the old horn mechanic had to find another location for the other horn. sounds o.k. I was expecting a more solid sound though. 
Be advised, this bit is 3 and 1/2 inches long. Description says 5.7 inches long which is NOT correct.  Did not work with my air hammer. Its too short does not have enough space to travel when installed on the quick release. So will have to return and get a longer one. I wanted an air compressor to keep my car tires inflated proper. This one does the job.  You can set it and it will turn off when the tire has the proper PSI. I use an air gauge to check behind it. Yes, it has a short AC cable but most everybody has an extension cord in their garage and if the cord was longer the unit would not be compact. The DC cord is long enough. A good buy This product is for turning a petcock valve, not for removing/installing a drain plug.  It's my fault for not reading the description clearly, but what I wanted was a tool for removing the drain plug on my Atwood 6 gal water heater in my travel trailer.  The nylon plug is in an awkward location and without a long socket extension (which I dont' have) it is a pain to screw and unscrew.  Even though this plug is only finger-tight. 
product description is a little off - actual ingredients are: Mineral Oil, Petroleum Distillates, Calcium Oxide, Aluminum, Graphite.I was expecting a new twist on the standard copper anti-seize compound, just suprised there is no copper at all in it. still does a great job, so no real complaints. Mobil 1 Isn't a bad oil. In fact it's a pretty good oil. I have used Mobil 1 for years in my autos. Is Mobil 1 the best oil you can put in your engine? I don't think so. First off Mobil 1 is a group III synthetic, which means it is not 100% PAO Synthetic. I now use an oil that's Group IV (100% Pure) Synthetic that out performs Mobil 1 and all other synthetics. People need to understand about motor oil to make the decision on what is right for them including if Royal Purple is what they should use or not.  Forget the marketing, and anything else that suggests this or any oil will do anything "spectacular".  What it can do is what a good motor oil can do, lubricate and help protect an engine from wear (when combined with a good filter). The synthetic oils benefits occur most when an engine is subjected to the extremes, high RPM, high stress, high/low temp situations where it will remain effective better than a conventional oil. Synthetic oils may also maintain their original properties a while longer than conventional oils.  That is it however. That is very important stuff, what motor oil is for. That is good enough, all that should be expected. But it is still motor oil. Any claims of this or any other oil making your car go faster or get better MPG or anything like that should not be believed. That is not the job of motor oil.The definition of "synthetic oil" in this Country is vague and most oils labeled "fully synthetic" are not made from 100% synthetic base stocks. To find out more about how this works look up Mobil Vs Castrol, this was the lawsuit in this country that allowed oils that originated from dino oil to legally be called "fully synthetic".  This does not mean they are bad oils, just that the use of the work synthetic can be misleading.One would need to look to see what base stocks are used to see just how fully synthetic an oil truly is. The base stocks in motor oil are Group I,II,III,IV and V base stocks. Group I-III (1-3) are all conventional mineral oils that have come from the ground. Dino oil. Only Group IV and V use synthetic base stocks (P.A.O. for group IV) and (Esters for group V).95% of oils labeled "fully synthetic" actually begin with group III base stocks which are then highly processed in to the final product.This does not mean that an oil is bad because it is not a true "fully synthetic" oil using 100% group IV or V base stocks or better just because it does use them, but this is something I think is misleading and not understood by most. Though being a true group IV oil using those P.A.O. base stocks is considered better by many. It is an indication of a high quality oil, and certainly meets the definition of a true fully synthetic oil, just not the only consideration.There is much more to an oil than just the base stocks used. The formulations are very complex including many additives with detergent and anti-wear properties along with several others. Many factors go in to making a top quality motor oil.I would not suggest one think they can go incredibly long times between oil changes just because they are using a high quality oil or because a certain mileage figure is on the label. When used with a good filter one may be able to go longer between changes with a good oil, but to protect your engine better you also need to keep clean and fresh enough oil of any type in it. This oil is no exception. Your oil may be capable of outlasting your filter. Some find that changing filters more often than their oil helps extend change intervals. Also there is more to consider when determining oil change intervals than just mileage. Engine type (does it have a turbo for example), environmental extremes etc. also need to be considered. And time is a consideration too because while the oil itself may not be "worn out" or the additive package in it may still be effective (particularly in Extended Performance versions which contain larger amounts) still there are contaminants that oil filters do not remove which are a result of the combustion process, over time these build up and can only be removed by changing your oil. This is also why if you use a vehicle seasonally such as storing your motorcycle over the winter it is best to change the oil when you put it away rather than at the start of the season.If you look on the bottles of oils with claims they can go for long periods of time between oil changes (15K plus) you will find some small print saying things such as "Do not alter oil change intervals from manufacturer requirements on vehicles under warranty (as this will likely VOID your warranty not keeping the maintenance schedule)" and "25,000 miles OR ONE YEAR" as well as many other various conditional statements about the vehicle operating conditions. What may be OK under ideal and perfect conditions is different from most all real situations.Some people engage in oil testing, sending their oil to labs to find out condition of the oil.  For me this seems perhaps reasonable if one it attempting to find out what length change interval they are able to obtain with a certain oil/filter combination.  However as something done on a regular basis for the average consumer this costs as much as an oil change so I would just change the oil instead of finding out the condition the old oil is in.As to Royal Purple being a good synthetic oil? I would say yes it is. Also very expensive particularly with this deal. If it is either the best or worth the price is the larger questions to consider. Is it worth it at this price? I would say NO it was recently on sale for 6.99/quart, at that time or the next time it goes on sale that is the prime time to purchase. Personally I prefer other brands, though my decisions are changing along with the changing of formulations of the oils I use. One should do research in to various synthetic motor oils and consider those as well and decide which one to use. Do not go by marketing claims. There are independent tests and discussions, there is even one with over 1000 posts on this subject on Amazon right now. Many other outside oil forums as well. One can also have their oil tested to compare results vs other brands used at various intervals in their own vehicle if one wants to do that sort of personal research which will yield at least some results.  Also formulations are constantly changing so what ingredients used in any particular oil one year may not be what the formulation is today or will be tomorrow. If you research oil and decide that it is worth paying a bit more for a true group IV oil, then that is a reasonable decision to pay a bit more for that oil. I believe this RP is among Group IV oils, meaning it uses 100% synthetic base stocks.  But contact Royal Purple to confirm this because their formulations change like all others. Make sure you know what you are buying.I would also encourage purchasing any oil when it is on a big sale or has a rebate etc.. I believe most synthetics are overpriced and should be purchased only when on sale as this does happen on a regular basis. Check Amazon and other auto supply stores. There are constantly sales on synthetic oils and/or rebates making the cost per quart 6.00 or less on a regular basis, this is the time to purchase your oil.  Often there are packages with filters which can be good deals as long as the filter is the one you would like to use also.  This nor any other oil will perform well without also using a high quality filter, period. Make sure you are also using a high quality filter. The two need to both be of good quality for best performance and protection.I give this a 4 star rating due to price. It has been on sale for less recently and that is the time to purchase expensive oils. Plan ahead and buy your oil when on a really good sale. You can save about 50% or at least close to it often times especially when offered with packages including an oil filter (as long as it is a good filter). The star rating reflects the value of this deal at this price.In the end get a high quality oil but remember no oil is going to be providing its full benefits if it is no longer effective due to excessive use or age.  Keep your maintenance schedules up to get the best performance and longest life out of your vehicle.Royal Purple IS one in the group of top quality motor oils, just where it ranks is much more difficult to determine.  Disregard outrageous claims made by any manufacturer or person and do your own research in to various synthetic oils to make a decision on which to use.  There are several very good quality brands. Also learn about API, ILSAC and Dexos1 specifications mean. This Royal Purple DOES meet the most current API specification (SF) the ILSAC GF-5 and GM's new Dexos1 requirements. It should be compared against other synthetics that also meet those same specifications. THOSE ARE IMPORTANT RATINGS. These are your best street car motor oils. So YES this is a good oil, NO it will not do anything other high quality synthetic oils in the same class can do, and No this is not the best price I have seen for this oil.Instead of comparing claims on a bottle (other than those API, ILSAC and perhaps Dexos1 ratings) do some outside research. Ignore outrageous claims and make an informed decision based upon knowledge of the oil and filters you purchase and what an appropriate price to purchase them at is.EDIT: Note that at the time of the review Royal Purple was using PAO base stocks.  I have information that it is not not a 100% PAO oil. This has been a pattern among oils that were once 100% PAO group IV oils so you can not count on any brand maintaining their formulations or advising or a new formulation or change.  There are some advantages to a PAO oil such as no need for V.I. additives and if you believe in the value of P.A.O. base stock oils that could justify a slightly higher purchase price.  My belief in this change is a response to this question by a representative or Royal Purple.  This does not mean it is no longer a good oil to buy just that the formulation may no longer use P.A.O. base stocks.  One should know what they are paying for particularly if they are purchasing a product at a premium price especially if that product no longer uses the ingredients one things it does. 
The micro fiber really grips a lot of dirt.The mitt works very well and does a a great  job in hand washing your car.Better than cotton towel. But not sure how durable will these be ?Used a few times and seems to be holding up pretty good. I can't wait till I can detail my car again. Winter's are so depressing to look at your car, inside and out. This stuff works well and smells good too. Come on Spring! I really like this stuff. It wraps well and looks good once it has been installed. Great to insulate anything that gets hot. 
I use Lexol leather conditioner on the leather seats in the car and leather furniture. Makes the leather very soft and pliable. The product works very well based upon condition of your interior. It will not make your car new, but it does work. Hope this helps. This has to be one of the best leather care products out there. I have used it on my leather coat, car seats and shoes. Does a fantastic job of softening and conditioning the leather. Even protects my leather shoes from salt damage here in the midwest, where sidewalk and street salt can really ruin a pair of leather shoes in no time. Would recommend to anyone. 
How can one really rate it, as it is used for protection and no idae how long it should last, yet is was as listed so I give it the benifit ogf the doubt... Works like it is supposed to.  I don't know if I really prefer the squeeze bottle to the spray oil, as both work.  The advantage is supposed to be that you are able to know how much oil your filter requires and can measure it out of the bottle.  I've only used the kit once on the filter on my boat, which is the stock filter and I have no idea the amount of oil it is "supposed" to have, so I just applied it as instructed like you normally would.  Good price on Amazon for the kit! If you've ever had to change the oil in your Subaru, you know just how difficult the filter can be to remove with the exhaust manifold in the way. With this handy tool you just attach it to a 3/8&#34; extension and ratchet and you can say goodbye to burnt knuckles for good.The technicians here at the Subaru dealership I work at turned me on to these when I saw how easy they remove filters all day. I'm certain that this would work on a variety of other filter sizes as it expands to fit. Well worth the cash if you ask me. 
I have used these before and had great results as you should after tuning up a car. I will buy these again and again. This is a nice little kit to paint your calipers while still on the car. It comes with a stir stick, pint of paint, spray can of degreaser, masking tape, and a brush to paint with. The process was painless to paint the calipers. I gave 4 calipers 3 coats of paint and barely used an inch from the can. I did have blue so maybe it covers better than some colors, but 1 coat was almost good enough. The result is all in the prep. You spend time cleaning and masking and the paint job goes very quick. I just painted the front and sides, bottom and tops but left the back.  It dries very quickly for recoat in 5 minutes. I had the car on jack stands on one side front and rear so I could cover both at once. Very little brush marks and the last coat I left to dry till I finished the other caliper 2 coats. This was about 1/2 hour. If you wait past an hour they recommend you let it dry for 5 hours before recoating to avoid bubbling. It is very glossy when done. If you order blue, pay close attention to the color as I was duped into thinking the color actually was represented on the package. It is very different and much darker, almost navy blue.I could have stopped there, but after having 2 calipers cleaned and prepped, masked off I thought I would carry on by chance it would look ok. For this unintentional deception I deducted a star, but am very impressed with the product otherwise. I will probably buy another kit to repaint them black as I am very unhappy with the color for my purposes. This product greatly exceeded my expectations.  My headlights look brand new again.  What a wonderful product!This kit includes the following:1 pair of latex gloves2 pieces of fine sandpaperCleaning clothsPretreatmentCleaner / PolishShine Restorer / ProtectorWe own a 2002 Mitsubishi Lancer OZ Rally Edition. It has about 100k miles on it and it's in pretty good condition. However the headlights had become very cloudy and yellow over time. I have tried scrubbing them with various cleaning products and pressure washing and never saw any improvement. I had been considering purchasing a new set of headlights but I figured I would give this product a try first.The instructions were very simple and easy to follow.I started off by applying the Pretreatment to each lens and was amazed as the yellow grime melted off of the headlights.Then I used the fine 1500 grit sandpaper and wet sanded the front of the headlights and this seemed to remove anything that the first step didn't remove.Next I applied the Headlight Cleaner / Polish and after completion the headlights looked very clean but they just didn't have that new car shine.Finally I applied the Shine Restorer / Protector and instantly saw a huge difference. I ended up putting 4 coats on for the last step and I had to wait 5 minutes in between coats. The whole process took me about an hour total. I also noticed that I have enough product left to clean them again in the future. Each of the bottles is still about half full. I am out of sandpaper but I can get that at any hardware store.I took a before and after photo of my headlights compared the two and there is a huge difference. They looked pretty disgusting prior to using this product and now they look just about brand new. I would have had to spend several hundred dollars to get a new set of headlights. This product will give almost the same result for a very small fraction of the replacement price. It's well worth it in my opinion.  I highly recommedn this product. 
How do you rate these?  They do exactly what they are supposed to do.  What more can I say.  It don't stink no more?!  LOL I have used this solvent a number of times to remove adhesive and badging from my cars.  For that it works wonderfully.  When used modestly it does not effect automotive surfaces or glass.  Since this stuff is so potent, I would recommend using the the spray straw in the nozzle so that you can more carefully target where you spray this stuff.  You want to be very careful where you put it.  It also evaporates rapidly so you need to work quickly when you use it.Just to reinforce a few precautions:- Do not get this on plastic (it will discolor it) or any soft/organic materials.- Do not use around high eat, as it is extremely flammable- Limit all bodily exposureOverall this is a wonderful product, just be very careful how you use it. I was suprised how well and how easy they worked even on an extended van.  It saves wear and tear on the shoulders. 
Used on a second hand tonneau cover, restored the black back to new looking.  It took a couple of applications, but worked well.  Also effective on other trim items, not necessarily only black.  It works like a clear polish that leaves no white residue. I purchased this product based on positive reviews by amazon.com customers to restore the rear trim on my 1998 Buick Riviera. While it makes a nice shine, Back to Black did NOT make the trim black again; it remains grey. I expected a more drastic improvement, like some of the tire shine products.In fact, I tried Black Magic &#34;Tire Wet&#34; on the rear trim, and it provides at least as good a shine as Back to Black.Bottom line : product is okay, but will not by any means restore black trim back to black This does not only protect, but cleans stains, road film etc. off the paint and bring its to nice clean shine. My cars have ranged from light colours (white and silver) to darker colours (red and blue) and this works perfectly to clean and protect. Sometimes, depending on how dirty the paint was,  2 applications would be done to restore the finish. Safe on clear coats and glass this is perfect. Also, one heavy shower does not remove the wax. Give it a try. 
This wax is great, I've been a detailer for a couple of years now using other wax's and polish's, and I've recently discovered this product. I mainly use it for my personal car or if I have to quickly wax a black sold car for work, it makes my job easier and I'm really happy with the final results of the product. I would recommend this product both to other professional detailer's, or to someone who would use once to twice a year. I've used Meguiar's products for decades, and I trust the brand. I've used this leather cleaner/conditioner for a few years now on BMW leather, and I've been pleased with the results. For weekly/monthly cleaning it is great. Easy to use and does not leave excessive residue on the leather. Also works great for any leather in the house - such as leather furniture, etc. As with all lexol products...excellant quality and serves my needs extremely well.  This is by far the best leather conditioner (for the money) I have had the pleasure of using....I highly recommend all of lexol products. 
When used as directed!!.  This is a GLAZING putty not to be confused with something to fill dents with. This product should be limited to filling paint scratches/chips up to 6-8 mils. Anything deeper may not produce the desired result.A few observations; 1) Fresh product coming right out of the tube has the consistency of ketchup, and spreads just as easily-fight the tendency to &#34;grow&#34; the repair area with extra filler. 2) Apply with a flexible plastic spatula to get the thinest coat possible. 3) work quickly as it dries FAST. 4) Thicker areas of the application dry last-make sure it is totally dry before you sand. 4) you really need to sand with a flexible sanding block, or you will dig out the repair with uneven sanding pressure. 5) wet sand with the LIGHTEST of touch, as the product tends to ball up when wet when friction is applied to it.Other than that, a much better way to fill paint chips than a blob of touch up paint. WHEN TO USE EPOXY CEMENTWhen you need a strong rigid workable (e.g. sandable and/or paintable surface) adhesive, particularly for use on metal or hard plastic, epoxy is usually the best choice.  Most epoxies dry with little running or shrinkage, and so are good for filling gaps.  The major drawback to epoxies is that they consist of two parts (resin and hardener) which must be mixed in small batches, and then applied with your own applicator (e.g., a toothpick or popsicle stick). Some are packaged in a dual-syringe--but that is not an adequate solution, because the components must still be manually mixed in order harden to maximum strength.WHEN TO USE JB-WELDJB-Weld is a very strong epoxy cement.  JB-Weld is the cement/glue of choice when joining metal parts or filling holes in metals.  Otherwise, ordinary epoxy cement or other types of cements/glues are usually better choices.  Some other reviewers have complained that the descriptive name "weld" is inappropriate---to some extent that's true.  JB Weld can do some jobs welding can't.  Conversely some simple welding jobs like joining two thin metal rods at right angles are difficult with JB Weld.HOW TO USE JB-WELDGeneral Principles: Although JB WELD makes an excellent filler---and can even be used to cast small parts, it is not remotely as strong as real metal used this way.  Whenever possible, use JB WELD as an adhesive---a very thin layer of JB WELD holding two pieces of metal together.  Always reinforce with metal pieces when possible.  For example, rather than building up a massive flange with JB Weld, you might be able to use scrap peice of metal to form most of the flange, held in place with JB Weld.  The greater the relative surface area of contact, the strong the bond will be.Surface Preparation:  As with any adhesive, the surface must be clean and rough.  Clean with a solvent (according to another reviewer, acetone is the best solvent for this purpose, but rubbing alcohol will work), roughen the surface, then clean with the solvent again.  Use a clean cloth for each application of solvent.  I generally use a small grinding wheel in a Dremel tool to roughen the surfaces.  You can also scratch the surface with a knife, or use coarse sandpaper, or both depending on the material.The solvent cleaning is for removing the LAST TRACES of oil from CLEAN surfaces.  If the parts are oily, even multiple cleanings with solvent may not be enough---you may redeposit oil from your cleaning cloth or as the solvent evaporates on the surface.  So, if you can detect any oil on any portion of the part, or if you have any doubt, clean it with a degreaser first.  If you do not have a commercial degreaser handy, a paste of laundry detergent and a stiff brush may do the trick.  Only when you are certain that there are no traces of oil is it time for the solvent cleaning(s).Joining Broken Parts: If you are joining broken parts, with a clean but irregular matching surfaces, limit the roughening to scratching with a wire brush or etching with an acid (but be sure to wash off all traces of the acid). Apply a THIN uniform layer of JB WELD, lightly clamp together hard enough to squeeze out any excess. Sometimes a thick rubber band is perfect. Often you can arrange pieces so that the weight of the top piece will hold the joint together until the JB Weld cures. Sometimes you can place a weight (such as a brick) on top to apply gentle pressure.  Do not remove the clamp or pressure until the JB Weld has cured completely.  After an hour or two, after the glue has set but is still soft, you can cut off any excess with a knife or razor---but if you don't need to cut the excess off, don't.  Often you can build-up the surfaces around a break for added strength.  Sometimes blue painters tape can be used to help hold pieces together while the glue sets, and/or to make a temporary stand to hold the pieces in the best orientation.ScotchBlue Painter's Tape for Multi-Surfaces 2090-.75A, 3/4 Inches by 60 Yards, 1 RollJoining Dissimilar Parts:  Minimize any gaps if possible, e.g., by sanding if possible so that the contact as perfect as possible.  If you will be filling substantial gaps, sometimes it is helpful to cover openings with blue painters tape to prevent the JB Weld from flowing away and leaving gaps.Joining Long Thin Parts (rods or sheets): Try to overlap if possible, or reinforce them with a similar overlapping peice of metal glued in place with JB Weld.  To join a 1/8" steel rod, to another 1/8" steel rod, forming a "T" (a common and easy welding job, almost impossible with just JB-Weld), cut two 1"-long "L's" from a heavy-paper clip, (or make L's from similar wire), and embed those with JB-Weld on opposite sides of the joint.  You can further strenthen the joint by wrapping fine steel wire around the rods holding the "L"s in place---before  covering it all with JB-Weld.  Be sure to thoroughly clean the rods and wires first (see below).  For small parts, or when wire wouldn't work well, unwaxed dental floss is remarkably strong, and can do an excellent job of reinforcing joints (when embeded in JB Weld). Ideally, apply the JB Weld, then wind the floss tightly into the soft JB Weld.Filling Holes:  Don't forget to prepare the surfaces as described above---even if you can only roughen the surfaces with an ice pick or awl.  JB Weld shrinks very little as it cures so fill the hole completely.  If it is possible to sand the surface when the JB Weld has hardened, then overfill the hole slightly.  Since JB Weld flows a little until it sets, the surface should be horizontal.  If not horizontal, you can apply the JB Weld and then cover the hole with blue painters tape until the JB Weld sets.  Depending on the job, it is often a better strategy to fill the gap as much as possible with a piece (or pieces) of metal embedded in JB Weld that a single mass of pure JB Weld.Reinforcing a leaking pipe:  Work JB Weld into a piece of fiberglass cloth or with a spatula, apply, and then add more JB Weld to any thin spots and to feather out the edges. You may have to apply several layers of the JB Weld-saturated fiberglass cloth. Sometimes wire cloth (window screening) can be used.Holes in car body panels etc:  If you can cover at least one side of the hole with a piece of sheet metal (held in place by JB Weld) that is a good strategy---the combination of pop-rivets and JB Weld often works especially well, even if you ultimately sand the heads of the pop rivets away.TEKTON 6555 Rivet Gun with 40-pc. RivetsMixing:  Follow the instructions.  A paper plate can be a good mixing surface; popsicle sticks are the best mixing tools.  Beware that you must use the same amount of resin and hardener, and they MUST be VERY thoroughly mixed.  Mix until you are certain that it is completely and thoroughly mixed, and then continue mixing for twice that time.  Seriously!!!Curing:  Follow the instructions, but wait longer than recommended: the longer you wait the stronger the bond.  A a day or two at 70 or 80 degrees is a reasonable MINIMUM.  Note that epoxies do not "dry"--there are no solvents to evaporate, instead a chemical reaction hardens the cement (a plastic resin).  Chemical reactions are proportional to temperature (the rule of thumb is that for each 10 degrees, the reaction speed doubles).  Using the rule of thumb, if it takes 1 day to cure at 80 degrees, then it takes 16 days to cure at 40 degrees, and that's only to minimally cured.  Okay, I know that waiting this long is not practical in many circumstances---you can probably get away with curing for 4 hours at 90 degrees (but don't go much higher than 90 degrees), and "take it easy" for a couple of days.WHEN TO USE OTHER EPOXIESFor materials other than metal, particularly for rigid plastics, other epoxies are usually better than JB Weld.  Some epoxies are clear, or white, or specialized for particular purposes.  For exampleCLEARBOND H-3S Clear Strong Epoxy Adhesive Syringe - .85ozWHEN TO USE QUICK-EPOXIESOrdinary (slow) epoxies (whether JB Weld or other epoxies) dry harder than quick epoxies and are generally the best choice.  Maximum strength is the whole point of epoxies--if you don't need maximum strength---you probably do not need epoxy.  Use quick epoxies when 1) the hardening speed is essential, 2) when the item cannot be supported in the required orientation while the epoxy sets (at least several hours), or 3) when you have to absolutely minimize flowage.  Super-glue is often a good alternative in such situations.WHEN TO USE OTHER CEMENTS OR GLUESWhile epoxies are ideal for a few specific uses (primarily when you need a rigid cement for metal or rigid plastic)--there are many situations when other types of glue are better choices.  Epoxies are generally NOT recommended for flexible surfaces, such as leather, wood, or flexible plastic, and generally do not adhere well to glass, etc.  While epoxies may work with porous surfaces (paper, wood, ceramics, etc.), other adhesives are usually better.White Glue: For most light-duty indoor household applications which do not have to be waterproof, ordinary household white glue is safe, cleanup is very easy, and in most cases repairs are redo-able if you make a mistake.  White glue shrinks a great deal as it dries, and so is not good for filling holes or large gaps.  For example:Elmer's All Multipurpose White Glue, 7 5/8 oz. (E379)Glue Stick: Think of glue sticks as thick white household glue in stick form.  Glue sticks are great with paper, but have few other applications.Avery Glue Stic, 0.26 oz, Pack of 6, (98095)Wood Glue: Carpenters's wood glue is essentially water-proof (when dry) white household glue.  It penetrates and strengthens the wood better than any other type of glue. It is safe, and cleanup is easy. If the joint breaks again (because the wood is weak), it can be re-glued. For example:Elmer's E701 Carpenter's Wood Glue 8-OunceGoop:  Goop will bond virtually any material, including leather, plastics, glass, and metal.  The bond is clear, VERY strong, waterproof, and hard but flexible.  Since Goop is clear, if a little extra oozes out, it is barely noticeable. I've used Goop to repair ceramic plant pots, water hoses, and shoes; to seal holes in air-mattresses, to close small holes in window screens, as plumbers paste in assembling plumbing parts, to  I also use it to seal rust spots on my dishwasher rack--the Goop it also makes a "cushioned" surface that will prevent scratches to dishes.  Goop is particular good for repairing damaged electrical cords.Amazing Goop All-Purpose Household Goop, 3.7-Ounce Tube #130012Silicon Glue: Silicon glue is best for glass, and when you want a truly flexible connection (for example, to absorb vibrations). It is a good alternative for Goop for general household use on glass, plastic, and metal when you do not need the maximum possible strength. It is safer than Goop, and cleanup is easier. Like Goop, silicon glue takes days to reach reasonable strength, weeks to reach maximum strength. For example:GE Silicone II Household Glue, 2.8 ozFabric Glue:Beacon Fabri-Tac Permanent Adhesive, 4-Ounceworks amazingly well on fabrics, saturating the surfaces enough to provide a very strong bond, but without soaking through.  Depending on the application, fabric glue can be better than sewing.  It remains very flexible, e.g., it would probably be great on leather or heavy vinyl (e.g., women's handbags, shoes, luggage, etc.)Super-Glue (Krazy Glue): Super-glue is very strong, rigid, and fast. In many ways it is similar to 2-minute epoxy---except that no mixing is required. Although very hard, super-glue is brittle, and so, is not recommended for flexible objects. Super-glue is hazardous in that it can easily glue fingers (etc.) together.  Previously, I used super-glue frequently on objects (e.g., jewelry) when a clear bond was required---however, Goop is better for such applications, safer, and more conveneient. Opened super-glue keeps poorly, even in tighly sealed glass containers---so I recommended packages of multiple very small tubes.BAZIC Super Glue, 3 grams 0.10 ounces, 6 Per PackLiquid Nails/Construction Adhesive:  When you need to permanently join a large amount of surface, of almost any kind, Construction Adhesive is usually ideal. If you need to join 2 2x4s to make a 4x4 Construction Adhesive is better than nails.  Most construction adhesives are slightly flexible, and so can even be used on leather (i.e., to repair a loose shoe sole), etc.  Construction adhesive may leave a stain on porous surfaces, and may stain-through thin surfaces.  For small projects, Goop is usually a better choice.Caulking Compound:  You can think of caulking compound as white household glue with alot of inert filler--to use when you need to fill holes.  As an adhesive, it is the weakest on this list, but is strong enough for many purposes when spread over a large surface, such as the back of a ceramic tile.  A few years ago, I made a brick column to support a mailbox.  Traditionally, I should have used mortar--which would have been very time consuming.  I could have used construction adhesive (albeit any excess that squeezed out would have been ugly)--but caulking compound was quick, cheap, looks good, and was more than adequate for the job. This was a bit loose on my grease gun, and a bit awkward to get fastened. An OK product, not exciting but serviceable. It does allow hanging the grease gun with some placement precision. 
I had close to a dozen pine tree sap spots all over my tonneau cover from being up in Northern Michigan from week vacation back in May.  Normal car washing didn't do a thing to remove them.  So I decided I'd try 303 and followed the instructions to the letter, sprayed on the Cleaner let soak, scrubbed a little, did a second application and sap spots softened and wiped right off. Impressed? Wait there's more... I then applied the Protectant, applied two coats and looks great, not ultra glossy, but semi-gloss and I like that very much, after only having on one day and while parked in my driveway for an hour while I took a quick ride on my Harley came home to find birds had decided what a nice thing to poop on!  Here's the even more impressive part, I broke out the Cleaner a few shoot on the &#34;effected&#34; area and wiped right off, didn't even have to re-apply the Protectant.  I'd by this again, No question! These are thick and well-made, and provide smooth application of wax on your car.  On the down side--because they are so thick, they absorb a lot of wax that just ends up being washed out of the pad after use.  Also, I did soak the pad overnight because it was a little dirty after using it all over my car.  It still hasn't cleaned out all of the dirt and excess wax.  I'll see how it looks after washing it in my washing machine. This is not your normal vehicle wax, nor does it apply like normal wax. The end result is basically the same. There are a few tricks to make it easier to apply.Test Vehicle: White Subaru ForesterWhite has to be the hardest vehicle to wax. You hardly see dried wax. With ICE you really don't see anything.I applied the ICE as directed. I covered all paint, rubber, lenses, and trim. I didn't touch any glass.The applicator works well. You need to keep the applicator slightly damp, but not dripping wet.After wiping down the Subaru I waited 10 minutes. Maybe I waited a little longer than recommended, but it didn't hurt the end result.Next, you wipe the entire vehicle down with one side of the micro fiber towel. This is crucial! You'll notice some streaking on black plastic and rubber trim. This step gives you time to work everything in.The last step uses the "clean" side of the micro fiber towel. Here's where you notice how good ICE really is. No dust. No residue. No white haze. No nothing. Literally amazing!Make sure you buff out EVERY area you covered with the ICE. No elbow grease is required. Just wipe everything down with the clean side.Time: 30 minutes from start to finish. I imagine it will be quicker in the future, but I was using a new product and took my time.Stand back and admire your vehicle. My Subaru looks great!

This is a water additive that can potentially increase your cooling capacity by a few degrees by lowering surface tension and increasing boiling point. It is smart to give warning lights as it can differentia between battery and alternator voltage. A number of reviewers have commented that the accuracy of this gauge is 0.1 psi.  It isn't.  The accuracy spec is +- 0.5 psi +- 1% of the reading.  This means that the gauge could show anything between 34.1 to 35.9 for a tire actually filled to 35 psi.Long story short...don't believe that 1/10 digit number that's being displayed.  If there's a slight change in tire pressure, it'll show it, but the actual value can vary significantly from what's shown. 
Used this on my 2004 BMW 325Ci for my Transmission Fluid Change. Noticed an immediate difference on how the car shifts. I would recommend this product to all BMW owners I could tell the difference it made in my limited slip differential . It was quieter and seemed smother . to soon to tell if it made a difference in mileage . Yes I would recommend it to a friend .Paul I beleave I can really feel the difference in the power in the car can't tell the difference in mileage yet . The engine is quieter and smother running . Yes I would recommend this oil to all my friends.Paul 
It does what it is supposed to do, that is to increase placement distance from the car to the electrical outlet This four station battery tender is just as simple to use as the single units.  One simply plugs the unit in and connects the battery via alligator clips or a connection affixed to the battery. Its a simple task to tell what state the battery is in.  If amber the battery is deep charging, if green range it is 80 to 100% charged.  After the battery is charged, leaving in connected will put the unit in float mode, which will keep the battery "topped off" without damaging it.  My only concern is the housing is plastic and all of my single units are metal.  It does have mounting holes so it can be wall mounted or affixed more securely to a shelf, etc.  Like the single units, total time from opening the box to charging is about 2 minutes.By the way, instructions for deciphering the state of the amber and green lights are not in the instruction manual but on the right side of the unit.I also ordered the 12 foot extension cables, a good call if you need to have your batteries more than about four feet from the unit. Works as intended, easy to plug in and charge the motorcycle batteries.I double checked with volt meter at the end of charging and was at proper voltage 
After reading all the various reviews on this, I knew I was taking a risk on the purchase but decided to roll the dice to see if it was my lucky day.First of all, I did not purchase this through anyone currently listed as a seller on Amazon, but the source is a very popular tool supplier that is listed for many other tools on amazon.  The priced was only about $4.00 more than the best listed.The mityvac arrived inside a sturdy shipping box that originated from Mityvac. Inside this box, the 7201 was nested inside its own box with a protective card board sleeve over the top of the handle. It arrived undamaged.Per the supplied instructions, I checked the screws in the upper lid to ensure they were tight (they were). I'm not sure if it came with a gasket under the lid that so many had stated was missing on some units. It worked, so why bother with taking the lid off.I tested the evaucation action by drawing a gallon of antifreeze inside the 7201. It did this quickly with only a few pumps of the handle. So far so good.Next, I tested the refilling capability by returning the antifreeze back into the one gallon container.  It did this quickly and very throughly leaving only about 1 oz in the botton of the reservoir.  Very very good.The supplied tubing is very rigid and I plan to replace it with some flexible hose from a local hardware store.I give this a 5 star rating.  Sturdy and well made. Had these back in the 80's and they have not changed.  My package arrived with one level ok, and the other missing the entire level glass globe.  No broken glass or liquid in the shipping package, it was just not there.  How did it get by Hopkins quality control, packaging, shipping, and Amazon without being caught? No problems with the great products but watch the packaging done by Amazon on this one. All of this came individual in a large box not in a Meguiar's kit box. I had to make sure that everything in the picture is what I actually got and it is. 
Shopped around and found the best price on Amazon. This is a handy device to have around whether you own a boat or just a car. Well built and can charge anthing that has a 12V adapter.. The Equus 3320 Auto-Ranging Digital Multimeter I bought is a handy, reasonably priced meter for general use around the house or boat. You can't have a better tool in your garage if you own several vehicles,so stop looking and make the best purchase ever! 
Great wheel lock that is easy to activate and unlock.  It comes with 3 keys, one of which has a LED light on it.  The product also comes with a reminder cord that attaches to the handle bar as a reminder.  It does just what I was looking for. Bad design...  The two doors that cover the  hose and charger cords are not hinged or tethered, can easily be misplaced. Battery has been overheating during charging and has melted the bottom of the unit.  LED indicators show low battery charge.I do not trust it.  I will keep it as long as the pump works. The 3rd generation powerprobe includes a number of changes for additional flexibility.  In short, it is a vehicle powered DVM with both a 20 foot cable and an additional 20 foot extension giving you a 40 foot working range around either the battery terminals or cigarette lighter outlet, both clips and a plug are included in the kit.With the series 3 units they use a hard gold plated banana jack to hold the removable probe or cables to extend your reach.  If you purchase the accessory kit, it includes piercing probes that self center on a conductor, pierce the insulation, and attach to the jack allowing you to tap a wire at any point to locate intermittant problems.While the DVM is backlit all the time, it also has 2 bright white LEDs facing forward to aid in finding and probing terminals in dark places.  The actual probe is hardgold plated with a sharp tip and removable at the banana jack.  Another identical probe is included with a screw-in female banana jack in the accessories kit to retrofit the powerprobe I and II units to accept external cables and probes.If you need to excite a circuit with a connection to battery ground or to battery positive, the switch allows a momentary connection to bridge the probe tip to either voltage which is useful in testing relay driven circuits, indicator lights, and other small current loads.  The prope voltage is always displayed during testing on the meter. The voltage/ground switch is circuit breaker protected in case you accidentally drive 12 volts into a chassis ground.  Additionally, since the switch takes abuse it is easily replaced if it fails with just a screwdriver.Combined with the testlead set, the powerprobe 3 greatly simplifies testing of vehicular wire and big rigs up to a single trailer.  The DVM has 5 selectable modes of operation designed for different problems.  Reading the manual is important to get the full value from this meter.Although the price is a little high, the design and construction quality are excellent.  Enough wire is provided to check running lights on trailers or to look for blown fuses.  All of the wiring is exceptionally flexible and heavily insulated with top quality connectors.  Both the tester and accessories come in hard plastic cases that can be stowed in a service box.Not mentioned in specifications is that although the probe runs from 12-24 VDC, the meter can be used to measure voltages up to 80VDC. 
Nice product, claims not to damage pressure senders, seems to be effective if puncture is in the tread.  Does not claim to work on sidewalls. It does what it is supposed to and suds up. It does exactly what it's supposed to do. No problems whatsoever. 
I found a Ford 6.0L diesel priced so low I couldn't pass, and, I knew beforehand it'd require certain upgrades to instill natural diesel longevity and I needed a tool to help - enter Scangauge II.Scangauge II has features beyond a simple scan tool, eg Trip Computer (Miles per Gallon; Tank-to-Empty; Cost per Trip), Horsepower, -Mile Time, 0-60mph WOTs, Stopping Distance and others...Neat features but not reason I purchased...Digital Gauges (reason): the Mfr refers to this feature as "X-Gauge"- Screen displays four real-time On-board diagnostics Parameter Identifications (OBDII PIDs) of user choosing- PIDs displayed can be changed via pressing adjacent buttons- Performance Data (MPG, Qtr Mile Time etc) may be displayed together/alongside PIDs- Displays vehicle mfr generic PIDs automatically (gasoline engine)- Displays diesel mfr PIDs (ie EOT, ICT, IPR etc) after user creates an 'x-gauge' by input data from Scangauge websiteWith basic knowledge and study I use this gadget to my advantage, I mean either repair vehicle myself, or, know what's wrong (exactly what's broken) beforehand, to preclude somename repair shop ripping me off - it's way too common.I think it comes ready to troubleshoot gasoline engines, in general, yet I'd to enter math data (avail on website) manually for it to sense and display PIDs unique to diesel.After several days of study/application, my opinion is this tool will help diagnose with near certainty, components which have failed and components in early stage of failure.  Its ability to depict four PIDs simultaneously in real-time allows comparison between what related PIDs reflect per desired and actual.Also note I found most big name Tuners boasting scan ability do not monitor/depict many key PIDs as Scangauge, a huge shortcoming for tuner price.Simply put, the Scangauge II is much more than an OBDII code reader and, it'll be difficult/near impossible to find an item offering same diagnostic capabilities for both gas and diesel engines at price.Update Jan 2014: I've purchased another for my Boy's pickup with a 7.3L.  We both have SCT Livewire 9600 Tuners but due to Livewire 9600's monitoring limitations we have Scangauges connected full time to monitor key PIDs.Kyle I use this often to check the tire pressure on our cars, optimal tire pressure means better gas mileage and thread wear. This works fast and is accurate. The only option I wish this had was a beep on completion of check. I have used other gauges that beeps to tell me the test is completed which was a nice feature. This is a must have tool for people who work on their own cars.  It seems the oxygen sensor is one of the more common failures that cause check engine codes to appear on the OBDII (engine and emissions control) computer system. 
I've been using Red Line Products for years. This transmission oil is the only one you can safely use in classic British sports cars. Highly recommended. I purchased this back in 1992 for my Oldsmobile and have used it on every car since: Accord, Civic, Integra, GTI, 240SX, 200SX, Maxima, Sentra and I could go on... You name it and it works. If you have a super wide filter or really tight space where the ratchet attaches, it may not be ideal. In my opinion, it's worked on 95% of the vehicles I've owned and this tool is awesome! this is a great compliment to anawesome jack!  I highly recommend having this if you own the jack.  It can be of great use when using the jack is tough due to angles, etc. 
A water filter is a very simply but essential device when you are RV'ing. Water quality tends to vary widlely from site to site. Having a filter helps with removing particulate matter and does improve the taste and smell of well water. This one is very well made, does not leak at either end and is easy to store when not in use.I tend to change the filter with each season of use. This filter works great!  It doesn't appear to reduce the flow and once the loose charcoal/carbon is purged from the filter, the water was clean and tasted fine.  Before hooking it up to your camper, make sure that you hook it up to a hose and purge all of the loose particulate matter from the filter or else you will have to purge a bunch of carbon from your camper plumbing system. Does what it exactly is suppose to do. One of the bottles cleans the air filter and once the air filter has dried, the other bottle lubricates the filter for the next use. Would recommend 
Tired of being charged WAY to much pretty much everywhere for a 5 min filter change? I got this for my 2008 prius and you can do the install yourself in under 5 min for almost nothing. Never pay $120 again at the dealer.Your CAF is located behind the glovebox. To get to it, you need to open your glovebox and let it sit open all the way. Empty out your glovebox. If you don't, you'll be cleaning up the contents of your glovebox from the floor when you're done replacing your CAF. Next step is to look on the right side and unhook the dampener. Next, squeeze the rear of the glovebox sides inwards to be able to let the glovebox swing all the way down.Looking inside, you'll see a tray with latches on both sides. Press those latches inwards and start sliding the tray out.When you put your new CAF into the tray, make sure you follow the arrow on the filter as the air is meant to flow through in one direction. The air flow is down. If you forget, the tray has an arrow on it also that says &#34;air flow&#34;.To finish the job, reverse the proceedures above. Slide the tray in, click into place, rotate the glovebox up and let it snap into place, replace the dampener bar, then close the glovebox. This air gauge is dead on accurate, it seals completely, allows air to flow the way it should and the two headed chuck fit all cars, trucks and even those pesky hard to reach motorcycle valve stems. I own three motorcycles and there is nothing more aggravating than trying to fit a chuck in between rotors, fork tubes and tight spaces on a motorcycle. You know what I mean. This two headed angled chuck is angled perfectly to fit over a cycle stem without leaking or having to bend the valve stem. I love it. MY EXPERIENCE: One of the things I really like about this funnel, is how long it is. It can literally reach down inside an automotive engine with ease, so that I can pour new oil into the crankcase, without getting it all over the engine, which could cause an oil fire!The bottom of the funnel is narrow for the first 6 inches. Which means, I can get it into a tractor dipstick tube, and effortlessly add oil. Because of the total length of the funnel, I am able to add more oil at a time, without worrying about spilling out of the funnel.Because of this same feature, I am able to put it through the filler hole of a vehicle gas tank, and it will stay there, and then I can pickup my gas can, and add a couple gallons of gas to the tank.OTHER USES: Here is another use, many of you may have not thought of. With a small mower, to drain the oil, all you have to do is tip the mower to its side, and let it drain into a pan. However, you can't do this with a tractor, because the engine is mounted to the tractor frame. So, I cant get a pan under the frame because there is my right side wheel in the way. After I attach my drain tube to the drain valve on my engine, I then take the Super Funnel, and place the tube into it, and then the funnel, into the oil pan. There you go, draining made simple!CONCLUSION: Though, I had to spend more then I would for any regular funnel, it is well worth the cost I spent on it, when I consider what uses I can get out of it. Like I said, tiny funnels are great for small things, but for larger engines, you need to get serious. I just love my Super Funnel, and if you buy one, you will too! 5 out of 5 
This was 10 bucks cheaper at Amazon vs a local auto parts store.  If you use it properly and service your air filter as you should, you will not go wrong with this product. This is one of the best oil filters Ive found! Great buy on Amazon, it blows away those cheap filters you get at your local auto parts stores. Save your money and buy this cabin air filter here instead of at your walmart or auto parts store. The markup is quite high but you can  save money buying here online. 
There are two horns, not one. One is 400Hz and the other one is 500Hz.PIAA | Automotive Sports Horn (400/500Hz) #85110The are exact fits on the mounts as the OEM horns and use the same bolts. A 1/4 inch drive ratchet and a 12mm socket is needed to remove and install the bolt. They came with grounding leads with ring spade lugs that mounted readily under the existing M6 bolts on the radiator supports. All you need is a 10mm socket.The two wiring harness leads are too short to connect the horns. Two wire tie mounts hold the harness to the aluminum bumper reinforcement. You can cut off the ties and use the OEM harness to connect the horns, but I chose not to.  I prefer NOT to cut off the OEM connector blocks.I made two pigtail extensions out of 18 gauge black primary wire, 5 inches long. One end needs a 1/4 inch wide exposed male quick disconnect. The other end needs an insulated female 1/4 inch quick disconnect terminal. Since I used 18 gauge wire, I used the red coded ones.The exposed male connector slides into the OEM horn connector perfectly. The female one clips easily onto the positive terminal of each horn.The horns how have a weather shield on the apertures.Best thing to my surprise is that they appear to be very high quality and Made in Japan.Also nice is that they need no modification to the horn relay or circuit. This is a universal sensor and you need to connect the connector.  It is pretty tricky to do the connection.  I used the clamping method as suggested but found that the connection is not tight as I just used a regular wiring clamping tool.I tried to solder but it failed as the material of the wire did not accept soldering.  Finally, I used a crossed twisted method to join the wire itself and then wrap it by thin copper wires and then solder the wrap.  The joint is very tight and I cannot pull it apart.  Replace it in the vehicle, it works fine and no more check engine light. These were a perfect fit for my 2001 Silverado 2500HD with the 6.0 but I had to do some research to make sure I bought the correct wire set.  GM used round or square coils (two different manufacturers) for a few years and the plug wire lengths are different. If you have the round coils (plug wire connector on the bottom of the coil) you need these shorter wires ending in &#34;GG&#34;.  If you have the square coils with the plug wire connector on the side of the coil, you need the longer wires ending in &#34;HH&#34;. The HH wires are about 1.5 inches longer for than the GG's.  You cannot make the shorter wires reach a square coil. 
It does just what it says.  Software will give you the exact manufacturer's fault read-out.  It's still up to you to find the exact cause, but this item provides the fault read-out at a bargain price.  Mine just paid for itself: the dealer charges as much to read the code as this scanner costs!  $29 more everywhere else! Matched my car's color perfectly!  I  don't know what else to say but there is a word count requirement for the review... What can I say the title says it all, it works as described.  The construction is good, but nothing to write home about.  3.5 stars if I had to give it an overall rating.  In all honesty not quite a 4 stars on this one. 
I received the battery and liquid filler tubes in perfect condition.  The battery has no liquid in it yet.  Just remove the metal tape from the battery filler openings.  The filler openings have points in them which pierce the six filler liquid tubes.  Anyway, put the battery on a flat surface, remove the caps on the liquid tubes and push the liquid tubes into the battery.  This drains the liquid into the battery.  The caps from the liquid tubes will be used to seal the battery when you are done.  Let it sit for thirty minutes, then cap the battery, charge, then your done.  Maintenance free battery so once the caps are pushed into the battery that is it.  A fresh battery rather than one which has been sitting on a shelf for who knows how long. I have used this charger many times to charge the battery in a car that sits outside and I rarely drive. The voltage and percent charge display is very nice.  Very easy to use I'm using this for an RV battery.  The leads let me mount this to the battery before the cut-off switch.  I can plug in a battery tender to keep the battery charged in the off season.  The positive side has an ATC fuse with a weather proof cover.  The ring terminals are solid and will fit 5/16" terminals.  The battery can stay in the box, hatch, or under a hood.  The connector stays in place while on the road tucked away with a twist tie.  Because its 12VDC, the 2 prong plug is water resistant and more or less weather proof.  Just make sure you keep the 120V charger out of the water and elements. Bottom line this little gadget serves my purposes ver well.  Note: this will not work with CTEK brand chargers... 
I have several Classic cars, a motorcycle battery, and two boat batteries that I need to keep charged, so I purchased the Battery Tender 4-Bank Battery Management System to help me keep the batteries at the optimum charge level over long periods of non-use.I have had several batteries go bad from overcharging on regular battery chargers, and from sulphating when not using or charging them for extended periods.  I decided to get the Deltran 4-Bank system to extend the useful life of my batteries  and hopefully, it will pay for itself in prolonged battery life for all of my different battery applications. I have used this charger many times to charge the battery in a car that sits outside and I rarely drive. The voltage and percent charge display is very nice.  Very easy to use The flooded battery for my riding mower wouldn't hold a charge for more than day, regardless of whether it was trickle-charged with a battery tender or charged in recovery mode with my Diehard Platinum charger.  Skeptical, I ordered this after reading that it was both reliable and had the potential to revive an otherwise useless battery.9 hours of charging later ... and my riding mower battery now holds a charge.  I also put a ring terminal comfort indicator onto the mower battery and deliberately let the mower sit ... and the battery moved from green to yellow (fully charged to less than 80% charged) across a week ... instead of full discharge in a single day.I probably need a new battery for the riding mower, but this charger bought me time AND proved its worth -- doing what my $90 Diehard Platinum charger could not. 
Fits for my Honda 2005 Lx.Comes with instruction that have pictures.I have to write more to finish this review. A number of reviewers have commented that the accuracy of this gauge is 0.1 psi.  It isn't.  The accuracy spec is +- 0.5 psi +- 1% of the reading.  This means that the gauge could show anything between 34.1 to 35.9 for a tire actually filled to 35 psi.Long story short...don't believe that 1/10 digit number that's being displayed.  If there's a slight change in tire pressure, it'll show it, but the actual value can vary significantly from what's shown. good cloths. exactly what you'd expect. exactly what the description says. 3 in a pack. all same color. exactly like the picture. if you need them then this is a good deal. 
It does what it is supposed to do, that is to increase placement distance from the car to the electrical outlet I got a power plug to power plug style &#34;jumper&#34; device for my daughter, in case the 12V battery on her Prius dies.  Since the Prius doesn't use the 12V battery to start the motor, she doesn't need real jumper cables.  However, it's a keyless ignition, so she will not be able to jump power plug to power plug.  The battery on the Prius is has small terminals, so these are a nice size and should do the job of getting power from someone else's light to her battery. I bought this to power cordless battery chargers and small bathroom appliances for camping.  One problem.  The manual clearly states it should not be used for any of those purposes.  Testing it with a DeWalt battery and charger confirmed this.  The DeWalt charger indicated a power failure and would not charge.From the manual."Certain chargers for small nickel-cadmium or nickel-metal-hydride batteries can be damaged if powered by this inverter. Two types of appliances are susceptible to damage: Small, battery-operated appliances such as flashlights, cordless razors and toothbrushes that plug directly into an AC receptacle.* DO NOT use this inverter with the above two types of equipment.""Some inexpensive audio systems may produce a slight "buzzing" sound when operated with the inverter. The only solution to this problem is to use a sound system with better power supply filtering.""In no event will PowerBrightTM be responsible for any amount of damages beyond the amount paid for the product at retail."Online descriptions, including the manufacturer home page, give no indication of the above important information.If you are looking for an inverter for the above purposes you will want to look into a PURE sine wave inverter.  Make sure you also review the power requirements on your device before you buy the inverter as well.  Underpowered inverters can be harmful to your devices. 
Works as intended, easy to plug in and charge the motorcycle batteries.I double checked with volt meter at the end of charging and was at proper voltage Well made. I like the quick disconnect harness that comes with this unit. Brings battery to full charge and switches to maintenance level. I use it every year to maintain the charge on the lawn tractor batteries.  Doesn't take too long and the indicator lights make it easy to know when the battery is fully charged. 
what more can I say? These work great, I have four. Best price I can get is here on Amazon, $2-6 more in the store. The lights tell you if it's charged, almost charged, or being charged.Have never had an issue with it over-charging.I keep it plugged in 24/7. GLAD  I  WENT  WITH  THE  CHROME AND  NOT  THE BLACK ONE, I  HOOKED  THIS ONE UP TO  MY GV1400 MOTORCYCLE IF  YOU  HAVE JUST  A  LITTLE  KNOW  HOW YOU CAN  DO  IT YOUR SELF , ALL  YOU WILL NEED TO GO WITH THIS IS A RELAY THAT DOES NOT COME WITH IT. YOU  CAN  GET IT ON HERE OR ANY PART STORE, I  HAVE MADE MANY PEOPLE JUMP  DUE  TO THE SOUND OF  THE  HORNS  LOUDNESS. Came in 2 days, was $4 cheaper than the store product. Came in appropriate packaging. What can i say i liked it i hope that is 20words 
I'd never heard of this until I saw it in my search history. This product works great!  You don't really need to buy it from Amazon because it's cheap regardless for what it does, but just happened to be a good add on to my order.  One thing to be aware of is that it does NOT dry clear or anything. I qualify 5 stars because it would be unfair to give a bad reputation, I purchased this product on September 27, I Bought 2 Armor extreme shine, I live in South America so I need an address where my purchases must arrived in the united States and then send to my country. My courier company said that they couldn&#8217;t transport Aerosol or contents under pressure because is a dangerous goods. I had to declare the product as abandoned, I lost my purchase. I will not be able to watch my shiny wheels, I'm sad about that, but I'm sure it's an excellent product because I have purchased other products of &#8220;Armor all&#8221; that are not dangerous goods and arrived without problems to my country where I check the good quality of their products. I'm very happy with my purchase. After seeing a lot of negative reviews due to seal problems I hesitated to buy this. The reason I did buy it was because someone found a fix for the issue. Turns out the fix is not needed. I guess the manufacturer replaced the gasket because I have no problems whatsoever with air leaks. This device creates a perfect seal. Buy this! This is an awesome gauge with dead on accuracy. I highly recommend this to anyone in the market looking for a gauge. I mean come one it's only 10 bucks! 
I am reading lots of bad reviews on these pigtails.  What worries me the most is some seem to be shipping with a different thread type and people are stripping them trying to make them work.  Why the heck can't these be standardized?  I've also read that some come with different sizes of NPT as well as different thread types.  It seems that what is listed is not always what you order, and on top of that, someone like me, who does not know how to recognize the different thread types and sizes won't even know if I received the correct part or the wrong part.I recommend you double check your part number on the hose before installing them to avoid stripping your regulator.I thought, why not use quick connect hoses to connect my regulator to my appliance.  It seems these mate up nice to other quick connects--but only if made by CAMCO, and then these quick connect fittings don't mate up easily to the other parts like regulators etc.  WTF?  I need still another adapter?  And some people tell me perhaps multiple adapters to make it all work?  I'm not going to use three different adapters to mate up a quick connect.  That means I have a huge lunking thing sticking out ready to be damaged, knocked out of place, that is sure to leak out all my expensive propane.Ok, so I called CAMCO.  I wanted to be sure I ordered the right part and spoke to two different people at CAMCO that blew me off.  It seems Camco parts don't necessarily fit each other.  And they don't sell adapters to make them fit. It would be great if they could provide some customer support and perhaps make up some custom hoses to help people make things work.I give this a 1 star because CAMCO's huge fail in helping me put together a system that will allow me to hook up external tanks to my RV.One star also, because they ship different types of hose fittings and buyers don't know what they are getting.Honestly, I'd like to order one of every one of their parts and analyze them.  I'm an engineer, and if I can't figure out what to order, based on conflicting information--reviews that report receiving different size fittings 1/4&#34; npt than specified 3/8&#34; npt, and a multitude of part numbers--and a need for adapters when a buyer should be able to buy everything he or she needs without an adapter---it all tells me CAMCO has not thought out how their products are used.Think about it, there are only so many way propane tanks, hoses and appliances are hooked up. I don't see any need for adapter other than those that attach to the tanks. Well this thing is as easy as tying your shoes laces. Plug in two wires, let it sit there for a few seconds and BOOM, it works. I still have to wait to fill up so I can calibrate that portion but everything else is good to go. This thing tells you everything you want to know about your vehicle components and more. The X-gauge is an awesome addition to an already great product. You can go the their website and review how to program the X-guages that are compatible with your specific vehicle. Don't wait like I did. Order this NOW!!! As usual Amazon came through with the shipping. If you don't want take my word for it, just look at the 300+ people that purchased it before me. Now I know exactly what my actual and average gas mileage is for my truck. When it comes to safe transportation, I try to take every preventive measures no matter how unlikely I will ever need it. First aid kits, flashlights, safety triangle, fire extinguisher, light reflecting outfit and finally this one, these make make up my doomsday inventory so far. Among them this may look to be the most extreme item but believe me people do get trapped in the car and unfortunately lose their lives just because they can not free themselves in time.I am afraid I don't have hands on experience about how this device works and I would never want such an experience, but just by writing the name resqme on youtube you will instantly see over 20 videos about that device. There you will see that it can really cut through the seat belt with one blow and somehow pulverize the window glass within seconds... So when you need it, if you can keep calm, it may take less than 30 second to get yourself out of the vehicle which would otherwise take minutes or not be possible at all.Due to great reviews and demonstrative videos, I purchased this item. I paid around $10 for a single one but sometimes there are bundles on amazon and you can buy a dual pack for $15.Although it is designed as key chain which is how you can keep it accessible on an operating car (provided that you don't have one of those new keyless devices) but like many other reviewers, I did not put it on my keychain. Although it is as small as it can be, still takes up some space in your keychain and feels bulky. Besides, since it has a built in blade, it may be misunderstood as a knife and put you some headache in airports and places like that. So, to me the best place to carry it is in the glovebox in a tiny case. But make sure that at no circumstance, it moves from where you put it and that you can access it easily from where you are trapped. This solution may not be ideal for some people and/or cars but then I advise you to look for a place that you can use for the purpose.I wholeheartedly recommend this product for anyone who values their life and wants to raise the safety level of their car trips and wish that you will never ever need to use it... 
Works as advertised! Heavy duty construction. Don't know that I care for the bolt that hold it in place would rather use a locking pin as I do with all of my other hitch devices. But that can probably be remedied if I can get out the threaded insert. The tires say 300 pound capacity and maybe that is what the rubber could support on a static load but these seem to be medium duty wheels. I purchased these wheels to replace the plastic wheels on a 5 HP chipper/shredder that weighs about 100 pounds and I tow behind a lawn tractor. For my application these wheels work well. The bearings are exposed and it seems that dust, dirt and water can get into the races. The metal wheel parts seem to be thin and I do notice that both have a slight wobble in them. For medium duty applications like my chipper it is ok. I would also use these wheels on my garden wagon and 5K watt generator. I would not use these wheels on a ride on mower that had to support my weight. I would use these wheels on the front free floating deck of my ride on mower.  A grease zerk fitting would have been nice on these wheels. I tried to sum it up in the title, this paint is tough, applies easily and covered more calipers than I needed it to. I painted 2 front and 3 rear calipers to a 1981 Trans Am. These are reasonable large calipers, fronts have large pistons and the rear pistons are smaller 2 1/2" to give you an idea of the size. I originally painted all 4 calipers at once, and still had a little bit of paint left in the can that I thought i'd save for touch up. StoneAuto company sent me two drivers side calipers, and I didn't figure it out till I installed them. So I had to use the remainder of the can to paint a 5th caliper, and it did it! Unlike other brands where there's nothing but air when the can gets close to empty,  VHT / Dupli-color impress me every time with their never ending paint cans. And there's still a little more left in the can!I also used the recommendedVHT SP118 Primerfirst, I dusted my calipers with 2 coats of primer then followed it with 2 dusting of the black and one last heavy coat, each coat spaced 10-12 minutes apart. I've maybe used 1/2 the can of primer. 
it's a depth gauge. not much to it- it does the job so you can better measure how much tire tread you have left. handy when you're looking to replace a tire and debating on whether or not you need to replace two tire, or have the new one shaved down.  a handy little tool. I bought this because I was in need of one for my car.  It is simple to use and does the job for an inexpensive tire gauge.  You can use it to measure your current tire gauge as well as deflate your tire if you have too much air. My experience with Slime has been limited to bicycle tires, where the product does a good job sealing up pinhole and other small punctures in the tire tube.  I have never used Slime in an automobile tire, but since the materials are basically the same, I would assume that the product would work in a similar way.For an automobile, where the flat occurs makes a big difference.  If your car is parked and notice your tire is flat, this kit would probably be quite useful.  You can at least use the compressor to pump up the tire and check how bad the leak is.  If it is a fast leak, you can try using the Slime and see if it takes care of the problem.  The car does not need to be jacked up to use the product.If the puncture happens when the car is being driven, the problem is more serious.  When you drive on tire that is significantly deflated or flat, most times you will do heavy duty damage, or tear the tire.  If that happens, Slime won't help.  The tire will need to be replaced.  The instructions state that Slime will not work on punctures greater than 1/4 inch.  So basically, Slime is intended to address only minor tire damage.The Smart Spair kit is a pretty good deal.  It consists of a 16 ounce bottle of slime, and a compressor which plugs into the lighter outlet.  According to the label, a 16 ounce bottle, should be adequate to treat one averaged sized tire.  The 16 ounce bottle is available at Amazon for about nine dollars.  Subtract this cost from the price of the kit, and you are getting the compressor for less than fifteen dollars, which is not a bad deal.  The compressor has a pressure valve, ten foot cord, and on/off switch.  It is pretty noisy, and seems to have a reasonably quick pump rate.  It is rated for use on a minimum 15 amp circuit.  Some older cars have lighter circuits rated at only 8 amps, so you may want to check this before you buy.Hopefully I will not have to use the Smart Spair.  Based on the good (though limited) experience I have with Slime, I thought it would be good to have around, just in case.  There are many situations, where changing a tire at the side of the road, can be hazardous.  A kit like this could be valuable to those that are not capable of, jacking up their vehicle and changing the tire.  It does not take a mechanical genius to follow the directions. 
I ordered these tire irons to change the tires on my Buell Blast, The fact that they include a pouch to keep the Tire irons in is a great addition. I used them to mount my rear tire (Pirelli Diablo) and it really held up to the job. I was think that with the way that I was cranking on these that it would bend, but not so. I would have to agree with other reviews that to have another pack so that I would have 3 Tire irons to use while mounting is a good idea. I know it ups the price a bit, but it's worth it. i did get my tire mounted with just two, but I did notice there was a point where I wouldn't have minded having a 3rd...Great Tire Iron, I would recommend these.. I read all the reviews how using this product... on the actual bottle you will find the instructions...I used 1 Oz per gallon of fresh gas. I didn't have any white smoke from my bike...I still need to run the motorcycle more often and see if clean property the dust of my carburetor. i have been using these filters on my bike that i occasionaly take to the track i do about 4000 miles a month and i can say this really is a better filter. 
How can one really rate it, as it is used for protection and no idae how long it should last, yet is was as listed so I give it the benifit ogf the doubt... These things are rated 8,000lbs but that's for ( GVW ) so while it's correct technically in reality each item is rated by the label at 2,000lbs per each item and if you had 4 (they sell them in pairs), if you had 4 of them you could put 8,000lbs on them, technically and according to them.****I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO RELY ON USER REVIEWS TO GET THE INDIVIDUAL WEIGHT RATING!!!!***GVW is a very deceptive and dangerous way to market and label these products.  Consider this, on a truck, the majority of the weight is on the front two wheels while the rear wheels don't have as much weight - same is true on a front wheel vehicle.  This leads to situations where you could overextend the capacity of these products.I'd like a very clear rating: 2,000lbs, 4,000lbs, 6,000lbs for each stand or ramp on Amazon so that I know how much weight I can safely put on it similar to what is found on jacks....a jack is not labeled as 6,000lbs if it can lift a 6,000GVW vehicle, 6,000lbs means that the jack can lift 6,000lbs!After all, I'm planning to get under these things!!!!On items like this where someone's life very literally depends on the labeling ---  it would be really really really nice (and a legal requirement) that the specifications on Amazon very clearly stated both the operating weight, maximium weight, and crush (failure) weight per each ramp/stand versus this GVW rating which is deceptive and just plain dangerous.I have very literally found people working underneath 8,000lbs trucks without the wheels using jack stands sold as "2ton" when in reality each jack stand was only rated at 1ton or 2,000lbs.....their comment back, "this is a 2 ton stand and 8,000lbs GVW divided by 4 is 2,000lbs or 1ton, plenty of margin."  When in reality 6,000lbs are up front....3,000lb for each wheel  and each stand rated at only 2,000lbs....making their jack stand 150% overloaded! --- horrendously scary (all because marketing is so bad in this area).  Yes people should exercise care in using double protection and users should Always read their instructions and warning before putting their life on the line -- but for the love of God, there is a responsibility on the makers and marketers of these products to label them very clearly and in bold with the weight that EACH can hold and Amazon should post that weight for each item in BOLD Yellow or Orange wording with very clear warnings.Amazon and automotive sellers on Amazon need to get on the ball regarding the needs of auto ethusiasts and for the safety of the weekend mechanic who should not have to do complex math to figure out how much weight each item can hold!We REALLY need to get away from GVW, it's deceptive and dangerous!****I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO RELY ON USER REVIEWS TO GET THE INDIVIDUAL WEIGHT RATING!!!!*** Works like it is supposed to.  I don't know if I really prefer the squeeze bottle to the spray oil, as both work.  The advantage is supposed to be that you are able to know how much oil your filter requires and can measure it out of the bottle.  I've only used the kit once on the filter on my boat, which is the stock filter and I have no idea the amount of oil it is "supposed" to have, so I just applied it as instructed like you normally would.  Good price on Amazon for the kit! 
To stress what other reviewers have said, when you order this "2 Pack" you get what you see in the picture: two chocks, not two sets of chocks.This is a good light-duty set of chocks. They are lightweight, made of durable plastic, and are stackable (like they are in the picture) to save space. They are also bright orange so you don't forget about them when the job is done.The bottom of the chock is slightly serrated, which will give it a decent grip on concrete and asphalt - just make sure you wedge them in well. I would not use these chocks on an incline, on a soft or uneven surface or on a vehicle with a bad parking brake, but for all your normal uses these should do the trick.The two chocks come attached with a plastic fastener. It's a boar to remove, so a pair of pliers is recommended. If you look closely at the picture, you can see holes pre-molded into the lower end of the chock. If you want to keep the two connected but still easily separated for use, I recommend a short length of twine. Ordered two of these for the two steps on my new RV trailer. I noticed that after I took them out of their shrink wrap and removed the rigid cardboard inside, the material is cheap, flimsy outdoor carpeting with a few grommets and cheap tension springs to hold it in place. These are a bit overpriced. If you have the means to put grommets in a couple of pieces of outdoor carpeting, then do that. (you can buy grommets at most hardware stores). But, these work just fine. The back of the material is a bit 'sticky' so they don't slip off. They look nice, but buckle in the center on curved steps, like I have. If you're looking for something that is quick and easy, then get these. If you are innovative, make your own. It fits well on the Jeep JK and looks like it will protect the taillight from things bumping into it.  But like all of these guards produced by different manufacturers, they are attached to the plastic taillight itself.  It will survive the casual bump from putting things into the back but it will do nothing for serious collisions.But like everything from Rugged Ridge, I like it.Even though there are three pages of instructions including pictures the instructions are not very clear.  They provide new screws that are longer than the original but they state to use the two inch screws on the outside of the taillight.  Well, all of the screws are two inch, its just that the two with the larger head and bigger gage go on the outside.  They also state to place the guards on the correct side but there is nothing on the guard to state which is left and right.  The first time I put them on it was dark and the lighting was poor.  The next day it was obvious that I had them reversed; no problem.  Fixed the error in 5 minutes.  They should put some markings on the guards to indicate which is left and right.It has taken me longer to write this review than it did to install the guards.  It should take less than 10 minutes to install them.  It is best to just look at the guards and skip the confusing instructions, use the bigger screws on the outside and spacers go on all corners between the guard and the plastic lens. 
There is no swiveling between the cap, the tube and the bottle. In other words, when you screw/unscrew the cap onto the car's brake fluid container, there will be kinking on the tube itself. Untangling the kinks is a chore because the bottle is both quite big and heavy when it is filled with brake fluid. They should have designed with some quick-connect/disconnect like the compressor air hose. That would be an ideal solution, but I guess it will add to the cost for adding that feature. However, I doubt that it would cost much because I browsed through the air-hose connectors at Harbor Freight and they run typically a couple of bucks each. I might modify this bleeder with the air hose connector to address the problem. There are two horns, not one. One is 400Hz and the other one is 500Hz.PIAA | Automotive Sports Horn (400/500Hz) #85110The are exact fits on the mounts as the OEM horns and use the same bolts. A 1/4 inch drive ratchet and a 12mm socket is needed to remove and install the bolt. They came with grounding leads with ring spade lugs that mounted readily under the existing M6 bolts on the radiator supports. All you need is a 10mm socket.The two wiring harness leads are too short to connect the horns. Two wire tie mounts hold the harness to the aluminum bumper reinforcement. You can cut off the ties and use the OEM harness to connect the horns, but I chose not to.  I prefer NOT to cut off the OEM connector blocks.I made two pigtail extensions out of 18 gauge black primary wire, 5 inches long. One end needs a 1/4 inch wide exposed male quick disconnect. The other end needs an insulated female 1/4 inch quick disconnect terminal. Since I used 18 gauge wire, I used the red coded ones.The exposed male connector slides into the OEM horn connector perfectly. The female one clips easily onto the positive terminal of each horn.The horns how have a weather shield on the apertures.Best thing to my surprise is that they appear to be very high quality and Made in Japan.Also nice is that they need no modification to the horn relay or circuit. I bought this to go with my Porter-cable 150psi, 6 Gal. compressor. Although the compressor comes with a tire inflation device, I like this one for the built-in gauge, the extension hose and the quality construction. 
I am reading lots of bad reviews on these pigtails.  What worries me the most is some seem to be shipping with a different thread type and people are stripping them trying to make them work.  Why the heck can't these be standardized?  I've also read that some come with different sizes of NPT as well as different thread types.  It seems that what is listed is not always what you order, and on top of that, someone like me, who does not know how to recognize the different thread types and sizes won't even know if I received the correct part or the wrong part.I recommend you double check your part number on the hose before installing them to avoid stripping your regulator.I thought, why not use quick connect hoses to connect my regulator to my appliance.  It seems these mate up nice to other quick connects--but only if made by CAMCO, and then these quick connect fittings don't mate up easily to the other parts like regulators etc.  WTF?  I need still another adapter?  And some people tell me perhaps multiple adapters to make it all work?  I'm not going to use three different adapters to mate up a quick connect.  That means I have a huge lunking thing sticking out ready to be damaged, knocked out of place, that is sure to leak out all my expensive propane.Ok, so I called CAMCO.  I wanted to be sure I ordered the right part and spoke to two different people at CAMCO that blew me off.  It seems Camco parts don't necessarily fit each other.  And they don't sell adapters to make them fit. It would be great if they could provide some customer support and perhaps make up some custom hoses to help people make things work.I give this a 1 star because CAMCO's huge fail in helping me put together a system that will allow me to hook up external tanks to my RV.One star also, because they ship different types of hose fittings and buyers don't know what they are getting.Honestly, I'd like to order one of every one of their parts and analyze them.  I'm an engineer, and if I can't figure out what to order, based on conflicting information--reviews that report receiving different size fittings 1/4&#34; npt than specified 3/8&#34; npt, and a multitude of part numbers--and a need for adapters when a buyer should be able to buy everything he or she needs without an adapter---it all tells me CAMCO has not thought out how their products are used.Think about it, there are only so many way propane tanks, hoses and appliances are hooked up. I don't see any need for adapter other than those that attach to the tanks. I've seen the reviews questioning the capacity of this cord, so I'm wondering if maybe there are changes in the cord.  The one I received is marked on the back of the package:"18 gauge wire""15 Amp Capacity"Now, I'm not an electrician, nor do I pretend to be one.  I don't know that 18G wire is sufficient to carry 15A.  I'll be using this for a small GPS that I mounted up high and I don't want the cord in the windshield. GLAD  I  WENT  WITH  THE  CHROME AND  NOT  THE BLACK ONE, I  HOOKED  THIS ONE UP TO  MY GV1400 MOTORCYCLE IF  YOU  HAVE JUST  A  LITTLE  KNOW  HOW YOU CAN  DO  IT YOUR SELF , ALL  YOU WILL NEED TO GO WITH THIS IS A RELAY THAT DOES NOT COME WITH IT. YOU  CAN  GET IT ON HERE OR ANY PART STORE, I  HAVE MADE MANY PEOPLE JUMP  DUE  TO THE SOUND OF  THE  HORNS  LOUDNESS. 
The 3rd generation powerprobe includes a number of changes for additional flexibility.  In short, it is a vehicle powered DVM with both a 20 foot cable and an additional 20 foot extension giving you a 40 foot working range around either the battery terminals or cigarette lighter outlet, both clips and a plug are included in the kit.With the series 3 units they use a hard gold plated banana jack to hold the removable probe or cables to extend your reach.  If you purchase the accessory kit, it includes piercing probes that self center on a conductor, pierce the insulation, and attach to the jack allowing you to tap a wire at any point to locate intermittant problems.While the DVM is backlit all the time, it also has 2 bright white LEDs facing forward to aid in finding and probing terminals in dark places.  The actual probe is hardgold plated with a sharp tip and removable at the banana jack.  Another identical probe is included with a screw-in female banana jack in the accessories kit to retrofit the powerprobe I and II units to accept external cables and probes.If you need to excite a circuit with a connection to battery ground or to battery positive, the switch allows a momentary connection to bridge the probe tip to either voltage which is useful in testing relay driven circuits, indicator lights, and other small current loads.  The prope voltage is always displayed during testing on the meter. The voltage/ground switch is circuit breaker protected in case you accidentally drive 12 volts into a chassis ground.  Additionally, since the switch takes abuse it is easily replaced if it fails with just a screwdriver.Combined with the testlead set, the powerprobe 3 greatly simplifies testing of vehicular wire and big rigs up to a single trailer.  The DVM has 5 selectable modes of operation designed for different problems.  Reading the manual is important to get the full value from this meter.Although the price is a little high, the design and construction quality are excellent.  Enough wire is provided to check running lights on trailers or to look for blown fuses.  All of the wiring is exceptionally flexible and heavily insulated with top quality connectors.  Both the tester and accessories come in hard plastic cases that can be stowed in a service box.Not mentioned in specifications is that although the probe runs from 12-24 VDC, the meter can be used to measure voltages up to 80VDC. Heavy rubber, good gauge coated snap connectors; comes with variety of components necessary to test different configurations of sparkplug on vehicles/equipment.Has extended accessory to test recessed plugs, such as those on a Ford Triton engine (coil on plug setup).This test set will indicate YES/NO as to 'fire' - not a measurement of current.In sum, if I'm experiencing a miss at idle or under load, and static ohm's are good, and this tester indicates all plugs receiving fire, there is high probability a weak coil exists.  I then pull/reinsert plug wires one at-a-time while engine is running/stumbling to pinpoint faulty plug/wire/coil - (o'skool way).Kyle The horns were easy to install. They draw about the same amount of current as my stock horns (in the 2.5A to 3A range for each PIAA horn), so I was able to use the stock wiring, relay, and fuse instead of having to wire a separate connection to the battery positive. I used Installation Type B (two horns, each with a single wire). The stock horn positive connections plugged directly into the positive quick connect of the PIAA horns. I didn't have to cut off the stock connectors and crimp on new connectors. The stock horns use a single connection, so I ran a separate ground wire from each PIAA horn to a ground point near the hood latch.I made an inverted T bracket to hang the two horns off of the location for one of the stock horns. The PIAA horns are a bit larger than a typical stock "beep-beep" style Japanese horn, so you do have to plan ahead to make sure that you have enough room for the horns and whatever mounting bracket you may use. I angled my PIAA horns slightly outward (instead of hanging straight down) to clear an engine brace below the horns.The horns have a nice Euro sound and are suitably loud. 
Very useful charger. I mounted it in the engine bay near the battery and it works as intended.Only downside to this charger is the length of the plug cord. It worked well for my application though because i mounted it in tandem with a flush-mount sealed power port on the side of the vehicle.It allowed my battery to remain topped up and warm enough to start at 35 below zero like it was no big deal.I will be ordering a second for an other vehicle. Bad design...  The two doors that cover the  hose and charger cords are not hinged or tethered, can easily be misplaced. Battery has been overheating during charging and has melted the bottom of the unit.  LED indicators show low battery charge.I do not trust it.  I will keep it as long as the pump works. Mine arrived perfect, simple to open packaging, and works as expected. Easy to use and comes with clamps and permanently installed wires if desired. This does not delufate, nor start a car, and at low amps would take weeks to recharge a drained battery, deep-cycle AGM or Gel type, as this is a very low amp trickler/float charger. Most AGM's require a special 3-4 staged 10-30 amp charger. Once the battery is charged this will do its job of tending/maintaining a full charge on any 12 volt DC lead-acid battery. I also have two Battery MINDers for our RV and towed that are garaged over the winter and a Tender plus for a truck. You need close access to an outlet or a properly sized extension cord and you can leave the battery attached, in the vehicle. I recommend this, would buy again, and hope this helps someone. 
My son suggested I get the whole K&N system but I opted for the factory style replacement filter instead. O.K., I am cheap...lol.  I installed this in my 2010 f150 5.4 litre FX2. I keep the avg.mpg readout on in my dash. I average 17.4 and I don't drive it hard. After the filter, I average 18.1. I was shocked and I am very pleased with these results. After much research and reading numerous forums, I made the decision to use Redline in my Honda Odyssey.  I wished now that I did so earlier!  The transmission is breathing new life and every time I drive it, the response from the transmission seems to be improving.  I will need to do a few additional drain and fill cycles to get more of this stuff in there.  If you are reading this post and own a Honda, you probably know the long history of transmission failures with Honda OEM fluids.  I have personally been on the losing end of that with a full transmission change in my 2002 Civic.  I hope that this will help the Odyssey last longer and improve responsiveness and reliability.  It eliminate the dreaded clicks and clanks normally heard when shifting between P, R and D and between gears.  The transmission is &#34;searching&#34; less for the right gear and overall working healthier.  I had a long hard decision between purchasing the D4 and the Racing Type F ATF. I finally decided to go midway with this D4 and then on my last drain and fill put in 3 quarts of Type F.  Hope this helps those that are debating on making the switch. Bought this to use withValterra F02-4100 45 RV Hydroflushso I could wash out my tanks.Here is my review of that setuphttp://www.amazon.com/Valterra-F02-4100-45%C2%B0-RV-Hydroflush/product-reviews/B0002UHVAA/ref=cm_cr_dp_synop?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints;=0&sortBy;=bySubmissionDateDescending#R2CUAU2B8XC98QIt works great.I also like that I have this as an emergency backup if one of my valves ever fails. 
These things are awesome.  I bought two along with some relays and relay sockets so I could get them enough power directly from the battery to do serious audible damage.  Make sure to buy this one with its mate, the 72112 low tone.  After wiring in the relays, these went in my 2000 Civic perfectly.  They replaced the crappy horn in there, and I used the wiring to tie into the relay signal hot wire.  Then, I grounded the relay to the body by tying it into the ground wire from one of the horns.  The horns come with these little wire slide connectors that you can clamp onto your wires.  I used wire nuts to tie all the wires together - I suggest you do the same.  I was able to mount them facing away from eachother with grounding connectors in between the mounts using a single bolt that held the old Honda horn.  This was ideal, and very clean - no drilling required!I suggest finding yourself a 12V DC 4-pin or 5-pin 40 Amp SPST ISO Micro Relay for this project.  Also, it really helps to have a 5-Pin Wire Harness Relay Socket.  This will give you all the wires you need directly from the relay.  These are really cheap items, and you shouldn't have trouble finding them.  The 4-pin relays work fine with the 5-pin sockets.  Then, educate yourself on how relays work, and wire that bad boy up!  I got my relay and relay socket on ebay.Overall, I'm very pleased with this product.  Buy it now if you want to be heard on the highway. I love the simplicity and reliability of this unit. It comes with 4 alligator clips and 4 O ring clips to hardwire to something like my atv. I hardwired the connector to the quad so all i need to do it connect and disconnect the quick connect clips.

Great Price, good to average product with nylon string support for strength.  The hose I got seems to be quite old and dry,  But By no means is it dry rotted or usable, its just more stiff and a little ridged then the brand new stuff.  But hey it works for my purposes and that's all that counts.  I made a 12V portable fuel station that pumps 5 liters a minute that runs off my Accessories port.You can stick this hose in one tank and flip the switch and it will empty the fuel from one car into the other in short order.Also have a 26 Gal, external marine tank the I have attached a wheeled cart  to and this makes a great refueling station. I camp at a nice camp ground.  It's more rustic than many RV parks and popluar campgrounds so not everything's perfect.  But hey that's why we camp right?  One thing that is less than pleasureable is the time spent at the dump station.  My station is slightly elevated over the road height so one person had to hold the hose up so everything could flow downhill and another person had to operate the dump valves and water at the station.  No longer!  Set the hose in the craddle...pull the valve...hold the flush water valve.  That's it!!!  Now this was designed for full service parks that have sewer hook-ups right next to the rig, but it will work equally well for both.  The carry handle acts as a retainer, and like all good RV productions it folds nicley into a compact and light package that stores easly most anywhere.  The price is good here on Amazon, beating out all retailers I've found with the savings on shipping. attach, turn on water, and stuff into filler.  its not a modern marvel or a super high quality piece but it does the job and you dont have to hold the hose there manually for 5 minutes or more while you top up the fresh tanks. 
Good quality R.V. water heater drain valve. Brass construction with a steel finger tip handle built in. A vital component when winterizing or just performing general maintenance. Teflon tape will seal threads upon install. Great replacement for older leaking or rusty valves. purchased this to fill my transmission and differential fluid.  Does an excellent job with no mess!...the tube that is connected to the pump should have an adjustable length but that is more a nice to have.  I added a piece of tubing the the plastic tubing so as to pump more of the fluid out.all in all, good product, good price and I would def buy again. I am working on my own truck and am not a mechanic.  I have not used the pump on the truck, yet, but just tested the pump for functions and leaks.This pump has 2 functions: vacuum and pressure, which are selected with a knob on the side.  The pressure release valve has a large handle, but this makes it easy to accidentally release the pressure.  The gauge swivels, so the gauge must be fitted with an o ring.  It comes with a nice case and all the little parts has their own places.For both vacuum and pressure, nothing leaked for at least 20 minutes.For about $72.00, Mityvac beats the Lisle vacuum pump (single function and came with broken pressure release valve) handily.Even though it will be extra expense, I plan to look for a bigger container for draining brake fluid.  I bought a rubber cork stopper to see if I can make my own air tight container. 
Below is the formula:1/3: to the manifold (using brake booster)1/3: to the fuel tank1/3: to the engineYour engine will be much cleaner. Remember: do it at night, otherwise, you will scare your neighbor with dark smoke. Now after winter is the best time to use Star Tron Fuel Tretment. Will get rid of moisture in tank and clean fuel system. This bottle will treat 500 + gallons of fuel. So it is very inexpensive to use. Does a great job. Works like crap. Does not allow enough air in to blow lines out. Save your money and use an air nozzle instead. Trust me! 
This is very handy to have around the house.  Works on any glass surface and truly makes it look invisible.  Just spray and wipe away in straight lines with a towel.  Works well on car windows too, and is safe to use on tinted windows. Spray this stuff on, rinse it off, and tada you have sparkling wheels.  Works great with painted rims, not sure on how it works on other styles of rims. Item worked out great for my camper.  The gutter spouts guided the water away from the side of the RV which in turn keep the water stains from the roof leaving black streaks on the RV side walls.Would  order again if need.  Works great 
I use this in combination with the microfiber glass towels -Viking Diamond Weave Microfiber Windshield & Glass Cloth - 2 Packand I was really shocked at how well this works! It really does make a difference over regular glass cleaner. Gives you a streak-free clean that somehow really does look cleaner than the "other" glass cleaners. i've tried really cheap wheel cleaner and this brand as well as meguiars, they all work the same. mother wheels cleaner doesnt clean the tires well, does clean the rims if you use the appropriate brush. its ok..... Maguiar's consistently makes a wonderful product. This does exactly what it is supposed to do. This is not concourse wax - this is a CLEANER wax and it does just that. I found it to be perfect for my project. Fast delivery too. 
I used this on my Burgman 650 scooter putting in speakers - major difference.This stuff real makes the area around the speakers thick giving better depth of sound...also takes out the rattles. If you aren't using your receiver for anything, this cover makes for a clean look -- and of course, it's branded. It also has a nice retention strap that keeps it on the receiver even when you remove the plug from the hole. The product page I am reviewing says it's for a Grand Cherokee, but this thing works with any 2&#34; receiver. This was the coolest engine color ever used by a manufacturer. Pontiac used this color from 1966-1970 for both their V8's and straight 6's. Pontiac used other shades of blue through the years, though this blue stands out with the metallic flake. As the previous review notes, apply in thin coats, it goes on a lot easier if you do. You can apply normal coats anywhere there is casting but on flat surfaces you really need to apply light coats.If you're cleaning up or rebuilding a Pontiac motor, there's no law that says you have to paint it the correct blue for the engine/car's year. I'm using this color on a 77' 400, and the motor is going into a 1981 Trans Am!Don't forget to useDupli-Color DE1612 Engine primerfirst! This is especially important on non-course surfaces.Heads Up: Pontiac heads will eventually burn off the paint applied along the exhaust ports. From the past 2 years of car shows I've been to, I haven't seen a single Pontiac where the paint isn't burned off over those ports. The only thing I have seen that did work is someone used a cast iron exhaust manifold higher temp paint along the exhaust runners, which looked as if it was part of the exhaust manifolds. As far as I am concerned, these burned off spots are your tiger's stripes and they belong there if your a serious Pontiac owner! 
Does a super job on brass, copper, silver, aluminum, bronze and stainless steel. Polishes most metals to a mirror-like finish. Very similar to Flitz polishing cream. This drain works good but is starting to corrode. It really should be made from stainless steel or even plastic. I have a brushed titanium finish bike with polished aluminum components, and this polish works well on both metals.I also used it to polish the brushed stainless steel exhaust tips on my car, with very good results. 
Mitt holds lots of water and both sides can be used as it is a flat style with cuff. This is the best lubricant to use on your bike chain for quiet operation and rust protection. It has a deep penetrating action to reach every part of the chain. It even comes with a thin tube that fits into nozzle to apply a few drops to the chain. It will extend the life of the chain and of the gear derailleur systems.The built in solvents soften and remove dirt and contaminants while displacing water to prevent rust and corrosion. It does not leave behind a layer of grease to collect and hold dirt and sand and act as an abrasive to the bikes chain and gear system.Tri-flow reduces chain and gear cog wear. It is also great for the rear derailleur to maintain crisp and accurate gear changes and to keep all of the components moving smoothly. It also works on the front derailleur system the same way.Tri-flow contains petroleum lubricants and Teflon particles so make sure to shake it well before you use it. I use it to maintain my bikes. It has many other applications and just like it states on the label, it is a superior lubricant. I use these caps, in conjunction with the Lynx levelers, to create a flat surface for the camper tire to sit on. I also use several under the jack tongue to minimize excess jacking when leveling the camper from front to rear. They can also be used under the 4 corner stabilizing jacks to create a flat surface for the stabilizer feet. Would highly recommend. 
THIS IS A STURDY AND INEXPENSIVE LICENSE PLATE HOLDER THAT ALLOWS FOR THE PLATE TO SIT ON THE EDGE OF THE HOLDER BECAUSE OF IT'S DESIGN.  GOOD PRODUCT. These are typical hard plastic handles, contoured for grip. The stock bar is substantial at 7/16". Edges are finished nicely. The metal shaft is unpolished and has a finish to prevent slippage.I don't care if all my hand tools are the same color, if it matters to you then note these may come in a different color than illustrate (see my pics).Made in the U.S.A. - nice.j These Rugged Ridge 7/8 pin shackles are Heavy Duty! The threaded portion is 7/8 and the Pin shank is .991 I had to do just a little clearancing on my aftermarket bumper for these to work... no big deal, they look great and I`m sure they will perform well! The finish is very nice! 
Does a super job on brass, copper, silver, aluminum, bronze and stainless steel. Polishes most metals to a mirror-like finish. I've been using this polish for many years and would definitely recommend it. have been using this continuously for past 2 yrs on my mustang gt deep metallic blue paint.. result are awesome, this shampoo provide enough lather to avoid any scratches. I have a brushed titanium finish bike with polished aluminum components, and this polish works well on both metals.I also used it to polish the brushed stainless steel exhaust tips on my car, with very good results. 
I required an ammonia-free window cleaner for my tinted windows. This does the job quite nicely. It isn't how well it does, rather how safely it does it. I haven't really used it yet for the reason intended, changing the oil in my jet ski.  So, I can't comment on how well it works.  The main reason for this review is to put it out there that it does not work with a 2000 Chevy Silverado.  The siphon tube does not fit thru the bottom of the dip stick tube.  It would be really nice if Mityvac had a published list of what vehicles it works with and what ones it does not.  I have my fingers crossed that it'll work with my jet ski, otherwise there will be a new/(un)used Mityvac on *****'slist.  Long story short, do your research to see if you can confirm or deny if it will work with your vehicle before you buy it. I bought this to do the brakes on my Porsche and it does not working very well it's too fat to fit in the space. 
I had an older version of this with a rough surface that trapped dirt constantly.  Impossible to clean.  But this one is shiny black powder-coated metal, and its way better.  Fit the oven in my Ragen 2003 27T Toyhauler perfectly. In PA winter road salt causes rust on car frames - this product is a great solution. I tried Permatex because the spray-on rust sealant at the local auto parts store did not last. This product turns rust black and forms a hard protective coating that can be painted. After several months it appears to be holding up well. We are now painting over the treated frame areas with black spray paint. This also works on tools, lawn mowers, etc. This scratch remover seems to be more of a polish  and lube that will remove the surface scratches for the paint. It does not appear to have any &#34;grinding&#34; type ingredients in the paste.It will have little of no impact on deep scratches or deep nicks in the paint. It is easy to out on and remove and will a decent job for those light scratches. It did not remove any discoloring on my paint such as a stain left by a bird dropping. It ddi make the blemish lighter though. 
Perfect for washing the RV...strong pole you can scrub as high as you need to go or can leverage. Holds its position when set.  Very pleased. These are light duty jumpers but will work for occasional use. There are times when the voltmeter needs to be connected and you cannot hold the leads. These are fine for that. Pros - As described, heavy duty, well madeCons - Have not used it yetLooks heavy duty and easy to use.  Have not had to use it yet so can not say how durable it will be.It is one of those safe guards for my Harley Sportster, now if I have a flat I can fix it. 
First, Permatex makes good products.  This is no different.  There are some products labeled similarly but do not contain true silicone in the same way this product does.This is useful for lubricating all sorts of things.  From moving parts you wish to keep lubricated such as door slides and hinges and other hardware such as that.  It will also help to prevent oxidation (rust) from occurring.  It is also very good for applying to plastic and rubber to both keep them with a film of lubricant which you might want on something such as "rubber" weatherstripping on the sides of car windows.  It is also good for for using to keep rubber, vinyl and most plastic parts from drying out.This is a product that goes on wet and while it will dry it will not completely evaporate but leave a protective film of silicone which is a good thing.This is not like products such as penetrating oils like Liquid Wrench or WD-40.  Those are good for their purpose but they are lighter lubricants made for penetrating and not leaving the same sort of film as this silicone spray.There are some items that could also be well lubricated with spray lithium grease but this has the advantage of being clear so it does not remain white so it is nice in that sense.The price here right now is significantly more expensive than the local auto parts store.  I would check prices before purchasing.  I love Amazon and sometimes they have the best price and certainly some of the best customer serviceyou will ever find but you do need to check prices as sometimes prices can be much higher (or lower) from place to place.As an aside, contrary to one persons review, this product is NOT an electrical conductor but just the opposite it is an insulator.It is contained in dielectric grease so do not get it on contacts of electronic products!  It can be used carefully on sockets for electronic connections to be used such as dielectric grease but do not get it on the actual metal contact parts themselves.  I tried to post a link to Wiki about silicone that explains this but Amazon does not allow which is why you see the dots in brackets instead.[...]There are other silicone sprays out there, some are also good, some are not.  Be careful to ensure you get what you are after.That is one thing good about Permatex products, they are a trustworthy company and their products are usually one of the best options for their purposes and they have a huge variety of products for very specific uses, most often in automotive products.  So this is a trustworthy brand that you know what you are getting is as described on the label and you are getting what you pay for.  Just make sure you pay the most reasonable price you can find. Use this product to recharge your K&N air filter.  I don't know of any other product I could use to recharge my filter. First off the label says it it non-toxic, which is kinda strange considering that it also says not to allow it to contact skin, eyes, painted surfaces and brake systems. I guess what they mean is that it can cause serious injury but wont kill you. Anyway the good stuff:Claims to work on:Engine leaksTransmission leaksPower steering leaksRack and pinion leaks& any other fluid systemException: do not use in brake systems.Pros:Does not appear to mush out (over-soften) rubber seals/rings when used full strength (undiluted). Seals seem to retain their elasticity and tensile strength (great).Not much odor, clear and easy to handle.Cheap for what it claims it does.Cons:Tiny bottle 8 oz.Observations:So far, I have not yet seen where the rubber seals/rings increase in size (expand)when soaked overnight at full strength (this was a bit odd).Cheap enough to be used for testing purposes. Based on limited testing I can only say that it seems that it would only seal very tiny leaks, since the rubber seals dont appear to swell (within human perception).I will update when further info becomes available (shortly). I am currently testing on a few items: transmission dipstick seal, civic top cover bolt seals, AC coupler o-ring, distributor seal, suspension bushing (front and back), radiator cap seal (watching this one closely).I will also change the rating - i hope it will do well.Update on Nov 10, 2012Transmission dipstick seal - works great, its now firmly in place - was very loose before using.Engine Oil dipstick seal  - works great, its now super firm in placeNote: Both dipstick seals took a whole week to swell and notice the difference.Civic top cover bolt seals - just applied some today, have to wait on results.AC coupler o-ring - no visible signs yet. Will have to use on live AC system totest. Windshield wiper rubber - Not recommended, rubber becomes too sticky and uneven - does not  clean debris well after use.Update to Jan 26, 2013:  Used it to stop a small power steering. It did make some difference to slow the leak even more. It did not stop the top cover bolt leak, nor the small transmission & engine leak (Only used a little in all three).Radiator cap seems marginally more prone to leaking after the fact. So I guess this product works best under certain "ideal" conditions. I would still buy itfor specialist applications due to its cheap cost. 
I read the instructions throughly and referred back as I was going through the process. The equipment is well made, and the key thing I learned after a lot of trial and error is that it would not work if I had the base unit too tight against the windshield. Part of the directions say that when you tighten down the tightening/driving screw that pushes the product into the crack, the rubber tip of the alignment device should "open".  If you have the bottom part too tight against the windshield, it won't "open" and thus your crack won't get filled with the liquid. Loosening the bottom allowed this to happen.I had a 1/2 inch crack starting in a line from a rock impact. The directions said to start with 4 - 6 drops, I did. After about 24 drops, the crack was filled. Keep cycling through drops, drive it in, remove the screw, more drops. The more you remove and replace the screw liquid driver, the more it drives it into the crack.My crack was very small, I thought, yet it took 24 drops of liquid to get the liquid flowing into the crack.By the time you master this artistic but very fruitful process, you'll be an expert and can offer tips to anyone! This tool is perfect for solo bleeding brakes. All you do is attach it to a bottle/jar/container via some adapters and tubing and then bleed away without the fear of getting air back into the brake lines.The only tiny problem is that the tubing attached to the bleeder screw is a air tight one way check valve so when you take it off a large amount of brake fluid is trapped on the intake side of the tube and if your not careful may make quite a mess on the calipher. I wish they included some button on the tool to open the check valve fully to allow the excess fluid trapped in the tubing to flow downward into the container to minimize the chances to make a mess. This little thing works perfectly!  I use to use a pressure bleeder, but was concerned about what some people say, that pressure bleeders push more air into the brake fluid, which causes both more air and moisture to absorb into the fluid.  Best way is to press the brake pedal, or put a vacuum on the bleeder screws.  A vacuum would be nice, but also a lot more work to setup initially.Instructions say this check valve does not work on air, only brake fluid, but on empty systems you can still pump the pedal until fluid comes out, and run your drain side pipe into a container that has brake fluid at the bottom.  That way you only suck back up fluid, not air.  Once you have fluid in the lines, this is completely unnecessary.  Did all 8 bleed screws on a Brembo-equipped car, was effortless.  I completely trust this little check valve, hope it lasts.  Rinsed it out with simple green and then a little PB Blaster to keep it from corroding or whatever.Remember to buy a couple more yards of cheap 3/16" clear hose from the hardware store, so you'll never run out, and can throw away what you've used after each brake job.The included hose clamp is worthless, but you don't need it anyways.Another great trick to compress pistons is to crack open the bleeder screw first, then push in each brake piston.  Fluid will go out through this check valve, instead of fighting every other brake piston.  Makes life a LOT easier, and does not push old fluid back up the brake lines or risk overflowing your reservoir. 
Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.  The pickle fork is the last resort for me, as it will damage the balljoint boot.I prefer to use the Snap On balljoint remover.  If that one cannot fit, then I will try this tool.  If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork. I haven't really used it yet for the reason intended, changing the oil in my jet ski.  So, I can't comment on how well it works.  The main reason for this review is to put it out there that it does not work with a 2000 Chevy Silverado.  The siphon tube does not fit thru the bottom of the dip stick tube.  It would be really nice if Mityvac had a published list of what vehicles it works with and what ones it does not.  I have my fingers crossed that it'll work with my jet ski, otherwise there will be a new/(un)used Mityvac on *****'slist.  Long story short, do your research to see if you can confirm or deny if it will work with your vehicle before you buy it. Fair price and does what it's supposed to do. It's handy for when you don't want to work directly at the car. 
I used this on my 97 Miata during a complete engine rebuild;The Good;Excellent product, from reports (although not mine personally) one of the best synthetic oils out thereFully SyntheticBottle is easy to use and avoid spills. (I also used a screw-in pump. I recommend you do too)Ships PrimeThe Bad;It can be pricey for what it is.I would use this in any performance car. I do not use it in my Daily Driver (Chevy Suburban with 150k miles) Love this pump. I have use it on re-filling my cars Transmission. works great I am happy with this item because, I have not used these yet.  I know they will be quite wonderful when I do need to use them 
I bought these some time ago.I use them mainly to detail my vehicles, cleaning glass is great, just don't use too much glass spray and your windows will turn up crystal clear.I use them "dry" to dust my dash/ door handle, etc...though you can use a quick spritz of some interior detail spray to make it even better.Keep a few in the car incase the windows fog up, these worked great.And you can use in the house as well.....things you can wipe down are only limited to your imagination. This one filter has done the job in my 2001 Silverado for 13 years and 225,000 miles. I have never had the heads off, so I cannot comment on the condition of the cylinder walls. Does not burn oil and still runs great. I have not cleaned it as often as I should have. Have only cleaned it 2 times. So counting it being clean when installed, it's been without dirt 3 times in 225,000 miles. No evidence that any dirt ever got through it. Use the K&N cleaner and no other cleaners. Do not use hot water as it can shrink the cotton fibers making the filter look wavy. All of the dirt will wash out with ease. Let dry, I sit mine in front of a fan. Recoat with the K&N oil which is red so you can see that you have fully covered it. Put a thin coat of K&N grease on the neoprene seal and you are ready again. This filter maintains it low restriction to air flow, even when very dirty. I have these in all of my vehicles, not to save money, but because they stop dirt better and allow more air flow. Cars that sit outside sometimes attract mice that chew up the paper air filter and make a nest. Not possible with the oil soaked K&N. Works as advertised in that it allowed my fresh water tank to 'breath' as I filled it to compacity.Before I would get air bubble blow back but not any more. 
This is an excellent product.  It really works best with Mercedes and BMWs where they also have the oil filter on the top of the car so you dont even need to get under the car to remove the oil filter.  Ive also used this on my Audi, which it works fine, but you still need to get under it to get the oil filter out.Also should point out, this wont work on some domestics because the way they snake their dipsticks into the oil pan.  Clear example is the Dodge Ram 04.  It comes with a tubing small enough to fit practically any car, but the dipstick on this truck snakes through to major curves so didnt work on that car.But I can say it will work for almost any import or german car.Dixit It is great. I just add it to the reservoir along with the regular washer fluid.  It does work very close to the original spray, so i won't say no to it.  The repellent effects stay on and does the job well. Buy it. I haven't really used it yet for the reason intended, changing the oil in my jet ski.  So, I can't comment on how well it works.  The main reason for this review is to put it out there that it does not work with a 2000 Chevy Silverado.  The siphon tube does not fit thru the bottom of the dip stick tube.

Didn't realize that this had a 3500LB capacity and 350 FT LBS for the tongue weight.  I'm using this on my travel trailer so I can take all our bicycles which all three bikes and bike rack make up a tongue weight of 180lbs.  A great buy I'm hoping the quality holds up as they appear plastic and my trailer weighs  over 5000lbs and sits on a small incline.  I will correct my review if they don't work but they were a good price. This does what it says it does. It is really heavy and is a bit much to lug around, but overall good. 
There are 2 part numbers out there for this product.... I have 15&#34; wheels on my 5th wheel so I ordered the larger one... I tried this out just for fit and I think this will work perfectly to secure wheels when one side is up on leveling blocks and can't be chocked. Fits a little tight especially around the front fender and floorboards but it works.  I have a 03' Shadow ACE 750cc.  After a couple rain storms I can report my bike stayed dry (except a portion of the front wheel) and through heavy winds, the motorcycle cover stayed put.  What&#8217;s nice about this cover is the price and how it has elastic hooks to secure the cover in place.  If you decide to buy a cover and your bike has a windshield, floor boards and aftermarket mirrors I recommend you buy a 2XL (if your bike is similar in size to a Shadow 750cc).  Look at the picture I posted, mine has stock mirrors and no windshield and fits VERY tight.  My mirrors shift out of place when the cover is on.  Before each ride I have to adjust them cause the cover is soo tight.  Also, if you have floor boards that&#8217;ll make the fit even more tighter.  Buying one size bigger and I would say you bike will be 100% covered. Very small cars only. SUV or truck or large car tires do not fit well between the ridges and deform the product. I fastened the mat down with 4 tapcon concrete screws, each 2 inches long, into my garage slab. The leading edge of the mat tore off the screws and folded up. The adhesive strip behind the mat was also useless. I would have had better result with a 2 x 4 piece of fir or pine and concrete screwing it to the garage slab. You also have to aim the car perfectly when you park it because the mat is only as wide as the tire. I can't return it because it's damaged from use due to faulty design. Wasted my money. 
Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Fits my low clearance Mazda 5 that comes with alloy wheels and 3/4 inches of clearance between the inside of the tire and the suspension.  Have not tried it in the snow yet.

They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Works great, nice to have a second cable, but the OBD end of the cable is angled.  In my case, this cable won't work on my Subaru Outback.  I would prefer the option of a straight OBD connector.  Note that the angle connector works on my other four cars (Mazda, Honda, Dodge). Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. 
I would install this on your Jeep as soon as you purchase the vehicle.  They're very easy to install and protect you from scratches that could lead to rust.  The guards fit perfectly on my 2011 Jeep Rubicon 2 door. Use these in trailer tires, car tires, truck tires, ANY tires-these have saved me several times on the road, pull the nail, install one or 2 of these, reinflate with a small portable (or my nitrogen tank if I'm in the service truck), back on the road. Bought this to install with an aftermarket Kenwood Navigation 7120 on my 08 Toyota Tacoma.  It took several hours to install, but it works great with the wheel controls in my Toyota. 
Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors.

These item does fit perfect on my 2004 BMW x3. does what its suppose to do. so far so good thanks The tool appears to be of average quality.  However, I returned it to Amazon since it did not fit up to a Ford Taurus flex fuel engine.  This type of engine requires a special fitting that this tool does not have. 
...fits my 1973 Chevy/GMC 4x4 steering wheel perfect. Stretch it over the wheel and wrap the vinyl string around it nice and tight. The vinyl will break so just stretch it a little. They only fit around a standard thickness roll bar not the newer jeep arrangement with the plastic cover shroud of the late models.

Made true to specs and fits right into the slot on my Accord 2006.Will buy again. 
Works great, installed it on my motorcycle and also kept the high tone stock horn.  With both horns the sound is VERY loud, it will scare the crap out of any dummies that pull out in front of me now.85db stock horn91db stock horn + FiammIf you understand how decibel measurement works you will know that is a big increase in sound. First, you will need to buy the high tone also, or it will sound stupid. It is part #72102. I have put these pair on my last 4 cars. The low tone does have a habit of failing if it gets wet. This has happened twice to me. For some reason, the high tone works fine if it gets wet. Make sure you mount the low tone in a location where it will not get wet.The kit does not include a relay. You may want to install a relay, especially if your car is wired for one horn. The horns draw 4.5A each at 12V. This is usually within factory limits and most fuseboxes will have a 10A or larger relay built in the horn circuit. The kit does include 3 female blade connectors, a mounting bracket and nut, and a jumper wire (needed if your car is wired with one horn lead).And, they are very loud. Packaging declares 130db at 4 inches. I do not have a db meter, but I can assure you the horns will get the job done. The pair has a nice tone, and will rid your car of the little factory &#34;meep meep&#34; horns. As everyone else points out, this intake tube will make your engine sound louder during moderate to heavy acceleration, but that is simply because it eliminates the factory resonance chamber.  The minimum cross section is the same as your stock tube so its not capable of flowing any more air than stock.  It still has the sharp 90 degree turn to the throttle body that the OEM system has.  There may be some minor reduction of turbulance, but at most engine speeds, especially where the engine spends most of its time, it won't matter.  I've never seen an independent  dyno test published with a before and after with just this mod.  Clearly the postings on Airaid's site are BS.  If something this simple could increase HP and torque by 5% across the RPM band, it would be incorporated into your car from the factory.  I doubt there is any HP improvement but there might be 1 or 2 HP gain.  Not enough to feel and not enough to measure with a G-tech on 1/8 mile runs.  On my 5.3 there was zero improvement in mileage over 40K miles of driving compared to before.  This includes some 400 mile runs pulling a 6000lb trailer.  It does look better than the stock set up and it really makes your motor sound like it has more power.  If that does it for you, buy one - its well made and fits great.  If you want a few more HP, save your money for a DiabloSport Predator or similar.  Only negative with the tube is you need to loosen the clamp at the throttle body to service your stock air filter because the coupling is not as flexible as the original (it doesnt need to be). 
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. It is clear and the flip thing works fine.  It fit my stock mount on my windshield perfectly.  It does come with a mount for you to use, just no glue.  But, as I said, it fit my old one with no problems at all.

Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. 
Exactly what was offered, fit nicely, no major prep work, won't fade or crack, adjusts perfectly, easy removal and fits under seat in truck Works just like it needs to.

bought this for my 2004 honda crv.  fit perfectly and cleared the code.  easy to do just give the threads some wd40 This fits not only the Ecotec, but newer VW TDI's with the canister filter.  Works great, relatively low profile and goes nicely on a 3/8&#34; drive.  I accidentally ordered three (fat fingered the cart), and sold one to a fellow VW driver and one to a guy with a GM. It fits perfectly to my 2005 Honda Accord.Filter quality seems to be good. 
Even though Amazon says it does not fit my truck; it does fit my 2002 Chevrolet 2500HD crew cab with 6.0L gas engine. I replaced both sensors and harness. Both sensors were rough looking and the rear sensor had standing water on it. It was a little bit of a chore to get to them because you have to remove the intake but it was not too bad. Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. Perfect fit for rear window on my 2004 Ford Excursion Limited. Easy to install.

I was looking for this air filter on the K&N website and went to AutoZone priced at 50-60 bucks. I put in my car info said, doesn't fit. BUT, it DOES fit my 2004 Crown Victoria perfectly. Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these.

This is only heat treated die cast zinc but covered by a lifetime warrantee (Limited to proper use).As such it should last okay, however don't abuse it, if the piston is that stuck your going to need to do the calliper anyway. Be advised, this bit is 3 and 1/2 inches long. Description says 5.7 inches long which is NOT correct.  Did not work with my air hammer. Its too short does not have enough space to travel when installed on the quick release. So will have to return and get a longer one. Bought this because I wanted to measure the length of a specific body part of mine.  Unfortunately a ruler was too big to measure the length of it.  I needed something very small in order to figure out how long it is. 
Primarily:  They do what they are supposed to for my 30 ft. trailer. Work well and easy.Secondarily: They came shipped in their own box, which is weak enough to need an outer box - arrived in pieces, but all metal held up, though scratched.  Needed to be a little less green to package the weight of 4 metal stands. Pros:LightweightStack when not in useStainless steel screwsStable cast aluminum base--no rockingCons:None that I can seeI use these to keep the truck camper weight off of the corner jacks when it is in storage. They are lightweight, yet strong enough for my purpose. Just like any cast aluminum, the stands get a layer of corrosion, but that won't hurt their usefulness. The screw supports are stainless and operate easily after 6 months of winter weather. Although it looks to be made with a thick sturdy plastic shell, mine came misaligned. I had to unscrew it and reset the 2 halves together. Functionally, everything seems to work but time will only tell how it will hold up. Also the company logo peels off pretty easily. 
I tower out at 5'7&#34; which is not considered tall when it comes to working on or retrieving items from the bed of my 4x4 truck. This came in a nice carrying case that stores well behind the front seats in my truck without scratching anything. I have put on the front tire trying out the fit and it will work well . Two of thes pads, under my Camco RV jack stands, raise the stands to the proper heighth for my pop-up.  They don't slip or slide on hard or soft surfaces. I use it everyday primarily for a storage cover.  I have not had the cover on the bike in rain or weather.  I got the XL for my CBR500R with full large rear bags and windshield.  I can lock my helmet to the rear seat area put the cover on and it will cover up the entire bikes exhaust and 3/4 of the rear tire and entire front tire.  Two bungies mid bike and front tire enable hokking cover under bike.  Very sturdy and breathable with exhaust panels (silver durable material) and inner windshield liner.  Much bang for the buck. Would certainly purchase another if I had to without question.

Please note that you must get longer bolts and the right SIZE bolts if your vehicle already has nuts built in like mine does.....Makes for a long drawn out guess at what you need for this simple task... 
i use this lube all around the house....door hinges, oven hinges, key locks, sliding door tracks etc.works nicely and doesnt leave a visual layer....dries invisible I wanted a strainer that would fit in the smaller of the two sinks in my TT.  The smaller being only 8" x 13".  The lips of this hang on the sides of the sink but that works well.  The cover becomes a tray for drainage if you perfer to use it on a counter top.  The lid snaps firmly shut allowing for storage of items inside for travel.  Not perfect, but all in all it works well. Clipped onto the doorlock and door latch rods securely and installed onto the inner door release handle nice and firm.  Worked perfectly. 
the ones I received are not identical to the picture.  one can only be installed on the side and the other can only be installed on the front (or back).  the markings are different for left to right level vs front to back level. This seems to be one of the better levelers. There are two different scales on these levels. One is for the side-to-side (back of the coach) and the other is for the front-to-back (side of the coach). The reason there are different scales are they are more-or-less calibrated in inches.For example, it is simple Trigonometry to determine how many inches the coach is out of level simply by using the formula for right-angles and solve for one side. The input values are the angle (determined by the level) and distance from the level to the point at where you want to know how many inches of lift are needed.For the side-to-side level, the 1&#34; markings are pretty accurate as long as you put the scale in the center of the coach, as most coaches are within an inch or two of width from another.  However, for the front-to-back level, even though you put the scale in the center, the result will vary wildly due to the length of the coach. Using this level on a 18ft coach will result in a far different measurement than say a 35ft coach.Also, if you don't put the level in the center (in the side or back), then the two ends of the coach will be different. For example, if the level is in the center, then when the level measures 1&#34; off level, that means 1&#34; on either front or back. But if you put the level off-center, then the level reading 1&#34; might truly be 1/2&#34; on one end, and 1 1/2&#34; on the other. Again, it is simply a principle of Right Angles in Trigonometry.Also, do not rely on the self-adhesive backing as over time it can move. As hard as it may be for you to do, drilling a couple holes and inserting screws into the levels is the best bet. The pair of levels are a great value.  I recently purchased these for a second time, as the originals were sold with my previous trailer and I wanted to make my new trailer easier to get on a level stance.There really isn't much to go wrong as far as product failure is concerned.  Accuracy is up to you with the initial installation.Recommended method of installation is to get your trailer level/RV, front to back, and side to side.  Once you have your trailer true, install the graduated levels in locations which will show you front to back level (placed on the side of the trailer) and side to side (place on the front or back of the trailer).  Make sure the bubble indicates "level" by being in the center point of the tube.Installation should be done once all your components are "stressed" as they will be for trailer/RV use (I.E. front tongue on a travel trailer, all the normal weight sitting on the winch foot, or in the case of 5th wheels/motorcoaches, landing gear down), try to place the levels on the RV in clear view of the winch/landing gear controls to enable leveling without having to relocate to a different location to view the levels.I accomplished this on a travel trailer by placing one level on the very front center, and the other on the side of the frame tongue close to the winch.  Though small, with sharp eye-sight, you can take advantage of the one on the front of the trailer as you position the trailer to see if you can establish a level side to side stance as you near your desired location.On my 5th wheel, my landing gear controls are on the front corner of the main body.  I placed one on the side of the rig for front to back level, and another right around the corner on the front side (for side to side level) still within sight of the controls, as well as from the truck cab for backing up.  Even though the level is off center, if it is installed properly with the trailer level at the time of installation, it will work fine.As far as the graduated scales are concerned, you will have to find your "scale" for adjustments, as it depends on where the levels are placed in reference to the center of the pivot points.The levels come with a self adhesive foam strip on the back for placement as well as two holes for screws if you wish to drill holes in the side of your rig.  I go with the adhesive strip route, as I don't like unnecessary holes.  The only negative with the adhesive strips is they will flex if stressed and it can put the levels off level, though this only happened to me with the first pair after the foam tape aged a few years.One last comment . . .the green bubble tube will fade from extended UV exposure.  It will not interfere with the accuracy, just makes it a little harder to read.If you are looking for larger levels which can be read from a distance, I know they are out there, but I have no experience with them to make a comparison.  I do not wish to clutter the appearance of the rig with large levels. 
Just opened my mail and a 3.5 inch long air hammer bit is what I measured. Not the 5.7 inch as the ad says on Amazon.com. Hope it still works out OK. I wanted longer one that would reach into the hollow van sliding door, as well as the hollow rear-side panel. It's a nickle coin size and flat on the impact end. I was looking for a arched shape, but this will do? I attached these to my travel trailer. This product makes it easy to level both front to rear and side to side. This item works very well. It has a really bright L.E.D light and setup is super easy. I think some folks recieved a knock off and therefore you might need to varify items part number and maybe even UPC number before ordering anywere online. Make sure it says MAXSA on the package and you have the correct one.It is very easy to setup,I measured our car first. Our Infiniti from dash center {were I wanted laser} to the front bumper was about 6ft. I then measured in my garage were I wanted the cars dash to be when I parked witch came out to be approx 9-10 ft from front wall. Thats 6 FT + 3 to 4FT for mower and walking space in front of car.Mine ended up being located in front of my garage door opener so my cars about 3-4 feet in my garage door when it detects it. That way it will light up just before I get to parking location I chose and laser wont stop shining before I park like some reported.My door opener dont seem to interfere with sensor even though its located between door and laser. Its a good sensor IMO. I aimed the laser on the center of my dash using a long stick while car was parked and the way I have it as long as the light is on the dash area rather all the way forward,centered or on the the edge of the dash the cars clear and your parking is fine.Since my laser is just above the center of the dash area and points straight down on the dash area, it leaves about a foot in either direction front or rear for some error. It seems to work well like this. It took about 15 min total to setup.CAUTION: Wives/husbands may act like they dont need a garage laser and it was a stupid waste of money. Even when they choose to drive your truck to work everyday because they dont want to pull thier car in/out of the garage before this was installed. This will pass soon as long as you "never" mention it was for them again. NEVER MENTION IT AGAIN!!!! 
I bought two sets / 4 total. I use them near the middle of the lifting range which puts the saddle about 18 to 19 inches high. This is perfect to get my truck off the ground and give me an inch or so of ground clearance to R&R; the tires and do other work underneath the vehicle.I don't need 6t worth of lift, but I like how these j/s have a wide lifting range. With these set for my range (as stated above), they are not teetering at the top of the range like others I've used in the past, but are comfortably in the middle. They are very stable and solid units.It would be helpful if the info stated the lifting range of the units, not just the tonnage they can support as a pair.Min. Lift Height (in.)14 29/32Max. Lift Height (in.)23 1/2 This worked perfectly for my 2003 Ford Excursion.  It fit right over the tire and gave me the extra height I wanted to load bikes on the roof and a car top carrier.  Seems very sturdy and well made.  The bag that comes with it is a nice bonus feature.  I see what others have mentioned though about the adjustable step and folding it up in the bag.  If you place the step in any position except for the lowest, you will not be able to store it in the bag folded.  All that said, it will still fold up in that position and you could easily put a bunge around it and store it that way. Very comfortable to sit on. Easy to assemble too. When you receive the package is like halfway assembled already. This product is reasonable. The height of this chair is perfect for auto detailing. 
This would be a great idea if it actually wasn't too tall to fit inside our camper cabinets.  I measured this before ordering and thought it would fit.  But you really can't judge how your knives will fit in it from the description.  Most of our knives were too thick at the handle or too wide at the blade to sit down inside it fully.  Therefore they would stick up too high and would prevent the cabinet door from closing.  It was a waste and I didn't use it.I recommend instead buying a full knife set with holder and overall product dimensions, and doing some thoughtful measuring.

The Tender Jr. does not come with a cigarette adapter so I cut this in half to make two. I purchased 2 lighter plugs for a buck each from China&#8230; with free shipping&#8230; and they are working fine. These aren&#8217;t an exact match with the Tender cables but they fit together OK and are easy to determine polarity with the wire colors. You can also just use this as an extension cord for your Tender. The description states a length of 12-inches&#8230; but it&#8217;s actually 14-inches tip-to-tip on the connectors. Nice item for the price and it&#8217;s made in Mexico. Sizes listed in reviews and the two in the description (15.8 x 10.5 x 5, and 12.5 x 9.5 x 7) don't match to what I received...The bag I received is in between what has been listed in the descriptions:  13.5" x 9" x 6" (empty).While seemingly a good quality bag, with a fair amount of straps and attached rain-cover (hidden in the heel of the bag), it seems the manufacturer (or seller) has no idea how to use a measuring tape!The bag itself is quite nice... good padding, rubberized bottom to prevent sliding, small pockets on either side, and zippers seem of reasonable quality.For the price and bag quality, I'm not complaining.  It works great on my CB750, and it does fit on the pillion of my VT1100c2 (without having to remove my rider backrest)  So if you have standard seating (or a touring/adventure style), this bag will do well for you as a pillion bag, and with a little strap adjustments, it also fits vertical on the front or back of a sissy-bar, or horizontal on a larger luggage rack... The 2 x 2 Inch mirrors are a good fit for 2006 Honda Pilot. I had to order via Amazon since I couldn't find these anywhere - it appears local auto stores only carry the 3 x 3 inch size. These little blind spot mirrors are a must buy item - they cover the blind spots on either side of the vehicle very well. 
Perfect fit for an 04 Camry.  Very well constructed.  The air flow on the Camry is down, so the arrow points down. Does a really nice job of collecting dirt and grit at the bottom of the bucket so it stays there and not back on your vehicle. Fits nicely into any standard 12&#34; bucket. fits perfectly in  one side of the rv double sink.  Additionally can sit on the Tray and drain into the sink as well.Due to size does not hold many dishes but adequate for my use 
I ordered this to help make a better fit for the bike rack on the front of a Ford Expedition. I was specifically hunting for a fairly short extension because I wanted the bikes to stick out no further than necessary. The selection of holes in this extension allowed me to adjust the fit into the receiver, as well as the fit of the bike rack into the extension. This allowed me to fit the bikes about 2 inches closer to the vehicle than any other extension I was able to find. Very pleased with its performance. I purchased this because it fits in the same bag that I keep my trailer ball mount in. This way I always have a lug wrench with me in case I get a flat tire on my trailer. It's a nice quality tool and one of the sockets fits my trailer lugs. Very happy with this purchase and I would recommend it if you're looking for a space-saving way of carrying around a lug wrench. I added this to my double receiver so as to use my bike rack and cargo hauler at the same time. Without this accessory my cargo hauler was too close to the bikes. This provide the added distance for clearance, 
I have two cars, both of which require the large #14 sheet metal self-tapping screws to mount the plate to the nylon retainers behind the plate (the ones mounted on the car that the screws screw into). Problem is that diameter of the plastic ring that holds the screw covers is too small to take the screw's large diameter head. The maximum screw head diameter that will fit the ring is .435 inch (11 millimeters). Option 1: Replace the nylon retainers on the car, but different cars have different retainers so one must search for new ones that will accept a #12 screw. Option 2: Try to find #14 self-tapping screws with smaller heads. I shopped around for #14 screws with smaller heads to no avail. Option 3: Grind down the screw head's diameter. Option 4 (not good): On one car I used #12 sheet metal screws that have a smaller diameter, but DO fit the rings, and wrapped the threads with tape. This sort of works, but I really can't tighten them down satisfactorily. So I have to check their security now and then. I'm leaving the other car as is for now. Maybe someone has more practical ideas? Sure would like to hear of them. BTW, SEE THE UPDATE BELOW.UPDATE 11/16/13:I think I've found a viable solution to the above problem. I used a #12 sheet metal self-tapping screw, placed a 1/2-inch long piece of ordinary shrink tubing (1/4" i.d.) over the threads towards the pointed end of the screw. Used a heat gun (or you can use a match, BIC lighter or soldering iron) to shrink the tubing which effectively increases the thread diameter to about that of a #14 screw. This allows me to tighten the screw securely and will last much longer than ordinary tape. One more thing: The THICKNESS of the screw head doesn't quite allow the chrome cap to fully snap into place over the nylon ring. The top of the head needs to be filed down a little leaving enough Philips "X" to use the screwdriver. I highly recommend these mirrors. I did a lot of looking and comparing before I bought these. I have a 2006 Toyota Tacoma and these things fit well and do a real nice job. They vibrate a little but not excessive. The little bit of vibration I see doesn't interfere with my view. I also do not extend them very far. The further out you go with them the more they will vibrate. Just extend to the minimum needed in order to be able to see.Before attaching to the vehicle I think it's a good idea to loosen the three screws holding the swivel in place on the bottom of the mirrors and work in a drop of oil. Then do not over tighten these screws. They don't have to be very tight to hold the mirror still and not over tightening allows easy adjustment later. If you find they move when you close the door you can tighten a little more but to start off, finger tight with the screwdriver is all you need. I also placed a couple drops of oil on the aluminum sliding bar and worked it in before attaching. Also, when you bolt the mirror onto the aluminum slide bar, grip the base (the part with the internal threads) with a vise-grip or something (not too tight to crush it), then make sure the lock nut is between the bolt and the bar on the bottom, and then screw the bolt into the base (and through the aluminum slide bar) nice and tight without letting the base turn. You'll notice there are &#34;teeth&#34; on the bottom of the base. These are supposed to sink into the bar as you tighten the bolt. They keep the base from turning when you adjust the mirror. This is another good reason to not overtighten the three screws around the swivel. You want to be able to adjust the mirror from side to side and have it turn only at the swivel and without causing the base to turn against the aluminum slide bar.The bracket will bend the weather stripping on the outside of the window a little. It springs back when the mirror is removed but some of it will be permanent. It's not a big deal and you'll just have to deal with this if you want to use these mirrors. It is not a detriment to the operation of the window.I installed them as far forward as possible so that the top of the bracket was parallel to the ground and the new mirror sits right beside my existing one towards the outside. Tightening the ratchet by hand produced plenty of tension to hold it securely. Releasing the ratchet is another matter. It's too tight to just push it down with your finger. To release the tension I use a short piece of rope and loop it under the sliding buckle. Then I stand right next to the truck with the rope looped around one hand and my other hand on the ratchet release tab. I use my body leverage (knees and back) to pull upward on the rope a little which takes just enough pressure off the belt to allow me to press the ratchet release tab. You don't need to back the ratchet off very far - just enough to get the hook out from under the door. Then just close up the bracket and wrap up the belt around it and you're all pre-set for the next time.For better stability I advise when you're adjusting the belt, place the sliding buckle as necessary so that the crossbar forming the angle is not extended very far, if at all. And, yes, make sure there isn't any dirt behind the buckle or you'll get a scuff mark.You should have the windows all the way down when attaching to the vehicle. The bracket comes close to the window so you need to be careful not to let it scratch the window. After you get the mirror on I advise to raise the window very slowly to make sure that the metal bracket is not contacting (scratching) the window as you raise it. Once you're under way - be sure not to lower the window if there is any sand or debris laying on the bracket right next to the window or a scratch may occur from this action also. I've taken these off and on several times now and we've travelled with them and I've been relatively careful and have never had one scratch my window.On my truck, the doors fit really well and I can tell the difference when the hook for the mirror strap is hooked under the door. The door fits just a tad more tightly than usual. It has to be closed just a slight bit harder to make the latch engage and when I open the door it pops out ever so slightly because of the extra tension produced by the hook being in there on the bottom. I don't see this as a problem. The mirrors are not on there all the time and, even if they were, I think the latch mechanism on the Toyota is stout enough to handle it without any long term problems developing. Just be aware that the hook will slightly change thge way the door latches.The instructions are good, too. Not the usual loosely translated Mandarin. I've tried to supplement here with my own experience. The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around! 
This works exactly as you expect. If your gap is too small, you can just slightly tilt the entire gauge while measuring the gap, and the gap will extend some... that is, measure, push to extend, re-measure, and repeat until you have the right gap.You can also use the inside of the small ring area to expand the gap. This is where I think the tool could improve. The small edge of the wedge on the inner ring could be smaller. Once, I happened to tap my gap too small to fit on that wedge, and had some trouble getting the gap to open back up enough to again work on the gauge.All in all, though, this is a necessity in my motorcycle tool bag. As others have said the pin is a bit long for a 2" receiver but this is easily remedied. To prevent the side-to-side play just get some small O-rings from the dollar store and stack enough on the fixed end. When you slide the pin in you compress the rings slightly to put the lock on. When you let go the O-rings expand and put pressure on the pin and also keep it from rattling. The picture is slightly misleading.

I am satisfied with this product, and what it does, because we all know how rust is and if we don't, let me say it can be a pain in the but you know what i'm trying to say, so to expect miracles would be beyond expectations.will use again. GLAD  I  WENT  WITH  THE  CHROME AND  NOT  THE BLACK ONE, I  HOOKED  THIS ONE UP TO  MY GV1400 MOTORCYCLE IF  YOU  HAVE JUST  A  LITTLE  KNOW  HOW YOU CAN  DO  IT YOUR SELF , ALL  YOU WILL NEED TO GO WITH THIS IS A RELAY THAT DOES NOT COME WITH IT. YOU  CAN  GET IT ON HERE OR ANY PART STORE, I  HAVE MADE MANY PEOPLE JUMP  DUE  TO THE SOUND OF  THE  HORNS  LOUDNESS. How can one really rate it, as it is used for protection and no idae how long it should last, yet is was as listed so I give it the benifit ogf the doubt... 
I added this to my double receiver so as to use my bike rack and cargo hauler at the same time. Without this accessory my cargo hauler was too close to the bikes. This provide the added distance for clearance, I use this with an Arizona Rocky Road antenna mount.  This is a high-mount antenna mast attached to the tire carrier on a JK Jeep.  I am using a 4' Firestik II and have a 1.2 SWR on all channels.  Works good for disconnecting too.  Buy it! They fit perfectly onto the vehicle and or trailer wire when not in use. With the retaining loop they stay with the connectors when you are connected vehicle to trailer. 
Didn't realize that this had a 3500LB capacity and 350 FT LBS for the tongue weight.  I'm using this on my travel trailer so I can take all our bicycles which all three bikes and bike rack make up a tongue weight of 180lbs.  A great buy These things are rated 8,000lbs but that's for ( GVW ) so while it's correct technically in reality each item is rated by the label at 2,000lbs per each item and if you had 4 (they sell them in pairs), if you had 4 of them you could put 8,000lbs on them, technically and according to them.****I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO RELY ON USER REVIEWS TO GET THE INDIVIDUAL WEIGHT RATING!!!!***GVW is a very deceptive and dangerous way to market and label these products.  Consider this, on a truck, the majority of the weight is on the front two wheels while the rear wheels don't have as much weight - same is true on a front wheel vehicle.  This leads to situations where you could overextend the capacity of these products.I'd like a very clear rating: 2,000lbs, 4,000lbs, 6,000lbs for each stand or ramp on Amazon so that I know how much weight I can safely put on it similar to what is found on jacks....a jack is not labeled as 6,000lbs if it can lift a 6,000GVW vehicle, 6,000lbs means that the jack can lift 6,000lbs!After all, I'm planning to get under these things!!!!On items like this where someone's life very literally depends on the labeling ---  it would be really really really nice (and a legal requirement) that the specifications on Amazon very clearly stated both the operating weight, maximium weight, and crush (failure) weight per each ramp/stand versus this GVW rating which is deceptive and just plain dangerous.I have very literally found people working underneath 8,000lbs trucks without the wheels using jack stands sold as "2ton" when in reality each jack stand was only rated at 1ton or 2,000lbs.....their comment back, "this is a 2 ton stand and 8,000lbs GVW divided by 4 is 2,000lbs or 1ton, plenty of margin."  When in reality 6,000lbs are up front....3,000lb for each wheel  and each stand rated at only 2,000lbs....making their jack stand 150% overloaded! --- horrendously scary (all because marketing is so bad in this area).  Yes people should exercise care in using double protection and users should Always read their instructions and warning before putting their life on the line -- but for the love of God, there is a responsibility on the makers and marketers of these products to label them very clearly and in bold with the weight that EACH can hold and Amazon should post that weight for each item in BOLD Yellow or Orange wording with very clear warnings.Amazon and automotive sellers on Amazon need to get on the ball regarding the needs of auto ethusiasts and for the safety of the weekend mechanic who should not have to do complex math to figure out how much weight each item can hold!We REALLY need to get away from GVW, it's deceptive and dangerous!****I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO RELY ON USER REVIEWS TO GET THE INDIVIDUAL WEIGHT RATING!!!!*** Nice lightweight solution.Reduces endless cranking of the front trailer jack.My trailer only weighs a thousand pounds.What more words! 
Just opened my mail and a 3.5 inch long air hammer bit is what I measured. Not the 5.7 inch as the ad says on Amazon.com. Hope it still works out OK. I wanted longer one that would reach into the hollow van sliding door, as well as the hollow rear-side panel. It's a nickle coin size and flat on the impact end. I was looking for a arched shape, but this will do? This works exactly as you expect. If your gap is too small, you can just slightly tilt the entire gauge while measuring the gap, and the gap will extend some... that is, measure, push to extend, re-measure, and repeat until you have the right gap.You can also use the inside of the small ring area to expand the gap. This is where I think the tool could improve. The small edge of the wedge on the inner ring could be smaller. Once, I happened to tap my gap too small to fit on that wedge, and had some trouble getting the gap to open back up enough to again work on the gauge.All in all, though, this is a necessity in my motorcycle tool bag. This is everything you need in a tread depth gauge, and nothing you don't. Here's how you use it: You press the &#34;probe&#34; down into the tread gap to measure the depth. You then rotate the cylinder around to match the exact mark to the line. The measurements are on four sides of the cylinder, making them easier to read than being stacked on top of one another. Being able to rotate the cylinder makes it much easier to measure something as minute as 1/32 of an inch. 
The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around! the ones I received are not identical to the picture.  one can only be installed on the side and the other can only be installed on the front (or back).  the markings are different for left to right level vs front to back level. As good as the factory original. Thanks for the tip from one of the other reviewers to drill a small hole in the top of the cap in order to attach the existing leash. (It doesn't come with one)

They can also be used on top of the levelers, for under the tire(s) to level your RV.  I don't know how much weight they can bare, but they do well with my 3,400lb trailer for all of the uses described above. I needed this item for an air compressor that draws 15A, and my 12V socket can only handle 10A.  This item is perfect, and small enough to fit in my air compressor's case.  It would be nice if we know how many amps it could handle, but the wire gauge provided is more than enough for my 15A need. 
I ordered this to help make a better fit for the bike rack on the front of a Ford Expedition. I was specifically hunting for a fairly short extension because I wanted the bikes to stick out no further than necessary. The selection of holes in this extension allowed me to adjust the fit into the receiver, as well as the fit of the bike rack into the extension. This allowed me to fit the bikes about 2 inches closer to the vehicle than any other extension I was able to find. Very pleased with its performance. I tower out at 5'7&#34; which is not considered tall when it comes to working on or retrieving items from the bed of my 4x4 truck. This came in a nice carrying case that stores well behind the front seats in my truck without scratching anything. I have put on the front tire trying out the fit and it will work well . I purchased this to be able to attach a high-end hydraulic assisted bike rake on the back of my Jeeps (JKs) with the rear tire still on.  It fit perfectly and teamed with the Bolt Lock BLT7018448 5/8'' Receiver Lock (Keyed specifically for your line of vehicle) it can be kept in the Jeep and my daughter doesn't need anything but her car key.The extender is exactly as advertised, well made, fit perfectly and does eactly what it is inteded for. 
I needed this to clear my rear mounted spare tire for trailering. These were impossible to find locally but of course Amazon had them. A must have for SUV's with a rear mounted spare. This is a standard replacement for your air filter in your vehicle.  In my case, it was for my Jeep Liberty. It is perfect to secure your spare tire to tire carrier or bumper. Easy to use and sturdy. Is not a eyesore, and seems well made, i highly recommend this to keep thieves honest, it wont guarentee a determined thief wont steal your expensive wheel/tire, but when the thief see's the steel cable wrapped through the wheel, it won't be so much a snatch and grab. Some piece of mind to myself. I run 31.10.50 x 15&#34; wheels (over $350 each wheel/tire x 5 = $1750), with a Smitybilt tire carrier, the 36&#34; cable was plenty long enough. 
Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars Perfect for exhaust work.  I bought it for a catalytic converter and o2 sensor project because it is rated for: -30F to 1800F They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. 
2013 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Sahara: Used this to extend a Bluetooth adapter to the glove box of my Jeep through the dash panels. Now my knee won't smash the Adapter and with the plug head being shorter I don't hit this either. Works just as I had planned. It fits fine on my 2012 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab.  I bought this and the stabilizer bar to keep my cooler(s) from trashing my truck bed.So EZ even a cavemen can use it!Ok, he might have a few cuts while trying!! I tower out at 5'7&#34; which is not considered tall when it comes to working on or retrieving items from the bed of my 4x4 truck. This came in a nice carrying case that stores well behind the front seats in my truck without scratching anything. I have put on the front tire trying out the fit and it will work well . 
These should come factory standard.  They look awesome installed, they give you some traction when stepping on the doors lower frame, and they keep you from uglying up the paint.  Couldnt be easier to put on, just rag off any mud/dust/ect from the area, use the supplied alcohol wipes to take off any oils and such from touching the area and line the piece up, pull the strip off the double stick, and press down along its length, easy peasy. This rotor seems OK, but the original is held in place by a screw that is under a plastic dust cover.  So, how do I remove the rotor? Works really well for lubricating car door hinges. The spray can design could be improved, the straw frequently comes out while in use and doesn't fit super tightly. Also, the tapered top of the can with a small cap means that the cap easily gets knocked off and thus the can is prone to leaks when being stored. 
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. Can't complain; it works perfectly and as advertised however, i should have done my homework.  it doesn't fit my rear disk... it only fits the front. Exactly what was offered, fit nicely, no major prep work, won't fade or crack, adjusts perfectly, easy removal and fits under seat in truck 
I have it hooked up to the SUV.  This actually works and will kick on every other day or so just to top off the battery.  It does get VERY warm when recharging a low battery so be careful where yo set it down...8-2013 UPDATE. The button to change the type vehicle its attached to starting NOT to work, no matter how hard you pushed on the button. It was returned directly to CTEK and replaced without incident (of course I had to pick up shipping to them).. Its simple and easy to install and setup.  It doesn't provide propotional breaking but for a simple brake controller it is the easiest to install (installs in any position) and easiest to use that myself and my buddies have found.  It just requires power, ground, and one wire to break pedal switch, as well as a  power output to your trailer brakes.  If your rig is prewired - all you need is the adapter plug for your make and model of vehicle and you simply plug it in, mount it in place and your done.  My particular vehicle was not prewired but installing and running the wiring, plugs and a circuit breaker (local auto parts store) and testing just took a couple of hours.After installation, you start your rig and trailer rolling and set the breaking level with the little thumb wheel (the display shows the output voltage to the trailer brakes) to just before the brakes on your trailer lock up and then back off slightly.  Your then set and ready to go!We liked best-1.That you can install it any position2. It performs a continuous self check and if everything is working properly is shows a  little "C" on the screen (for connected and working properly)  When breaking it shows the breaking voltage applied to the trailer brakes.  If your not connected properly to the trailer it just shows a blank screen with a decimal point.3. It was easy to install, setup and use and will handle up to 3 axles and has worked flawlessly over the last several thousand miles of trailer driving. I have tested it on the plains, rolling hills and mountains and its really nice to find a product that I can highly recommend.For the money I would have to give it a best value rating.  The next step up would be a controller with proportional breaking control which gets up into the high dollar units, starting around $200-Scott Extension cable for inverter. Can set up inverter a good ways away from car if I need to. Just handy to have. 
I installed one of these springs at the bottom of the door.  As others have said, 1 seems plenty strong to close the door without making it slam.  If you only hold the door a few inches open, it won't latch.  But if you open it like you are walking out it will close tight and the latch engages.I think installing the second spring will make the door slam too hard.  But its nice having the second spring just in case you need it.I installed it using the existing screw on the outside of the screen door (where the hinge attaches).  I think measured up 9" (as the directions say) and drilled a hole such that the spring fits between the screen door and the outside door when they are both closed.- to be clear - when you are standing outside the camper, with the screen door closed, you see the spring go from the hinge on the screen door to the door frame.The pictures in the directions seemed a little confusing to me.  It looks more like they want you to put the spring on the inside of the door.  But then you have the spring dragging across the frame when you open the door, scratching the frame and probably making a lot of noise.My way of installing it has zero noise (the spring is not rubbing on anything) and it works nicely.Just make sure there is adequate clearance between your outside door and your screen door before installing the spring.I will take a picture if I get a chance and post it.*** UPDATE ***I added a picture with notes.We had the camper out for 5 days and the spring worked great.  Using just 1 spring is enough to close the screen door and it even will pull the combined screen & exterior doors closed.  (not hard enough to latch, but closed).  I think I will leave it as-is and keep the second spring as a backup. The springs do one thing only, they pull the screen door closed, they do not control closing speed or latch speed. I tried one spring at first and found that it was not enough to hold the door from remaining slightly open if it didn't latch. Two springs and the door actually follows you when entering, and provides quick closing motion from any position when exiting. Also be sure to install the springs in such a way that they do not drag across any part of the frame or door or you'll get a twanging boing with a buzz. The 9" dimension is perfect. I put lengths of straws on each to help quiet them. I like the interaction now because the door actually feels like it prefers to be closed without being overpowering. Not enough tension to close the outer door but who cares, it's the perfect solution to the annoying screen door. No more "nagging" to close the screen door! You could probably buy a spring at your local hardware store for about the same price, but the pre-determined install tension (distance to drill holes) and where to mount the spring(s) makes it well worth the $7. I followed the instructions for screw hole distance and only needed 1 spring. Both springs may pull the door past the latch at rest (without door swinging closed), but a normal entry/exit the single spring has enough to overcome the latch without slamming the door. 
bought this for my 2004 honda crv.  fit perfectly and cleared the code.  easy to do just give the threads some wd40 It fits perfectly to my 2005 Honda Accord.Filter quality seems to be good. Fit perfectly on my 2012 Honda Civic Si. Way better than spending the premium for Honda to do it, takes like 1 minute. 
GLAD  I  WENT  WITH  THE  CHROME AND  NOT  THE BLACK ONE, I  HOOKED  THIS ONE UP TO  MY GV1400 MOTORCYCLE IF  YOU  HAVE JUST  A  LITTLE  KNOW  HOW YOU CAN  DO  IT YOUR SELF , ALL  YOU WILL NEED TO GO WITH THIS IS A RELAY THAT DOES NOT COME WITH IT. YOU  CAN  GET IT ON HERE OR ANY PART STORE, I  HAVE MADE MANY PEOPLE JUMP  DUE  TO THE SOUND OF  THE  HORNS  LOUDNESS. This stuff can save the day when you have a flat. I dont want to spend time at the side of the road, and I dont like hearing in the news of people dying being hit by cars when trying to change a tire. I dont care how good you are at doing it, its going to take some time, and time is not on your side when texting drivers are passing by you at seventy mph.I just squirt some in and use my portable tire inflator to get me home or to a tire shop and deal with it there. Easy to connect and just squeeze.This is cheap insurance These work well for a budget level. They have double sided tape on the back and a couple of drill holes for security. The problem is that if you only use the tape they can move simply by grabbing them and wiggling them around. The onyl way to truly secure them is to drill holes. I did not want to drill holes in my RV in the event that I didn't like these or wanted to go with something else in the future.If you do get them I would buy a couple packs of them so that if they break or go bad you can put a new one in without chancing them being unavilable and potentially having to get something else that doesn't have the same screw hole pattern. 
Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars Inexpensive, yet works as good as the ones sold by Honda dealerships. Made true to specs and fits right into the slot on my Accord 2006.Will buy again. They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. 
Sizes listed in reviews and the two in the description (15.8 x 10.5 x 5, and 12.5 x 9.5 x 7) don't match to what I received...The bag I received is in between what has been listed in the descriptions:  13.5" x 9" x 6" (empty).While seemingly a good quality bag, with a fair amount of straps and attached rain-cover (hidden in the heel of the bag), it seems the manufacturer (or seller) has no idea how to use a measuring tape!The bag itself is quite nice... good padding, rubberized bottom to prevent sliding, small pockets on either side, and zippers seem of reasonable quality.For the price and bag quality, I'm not complaining.  It works great on my CB750, and it does fit on the pillion of my VT1100c2 (without having to remove my rider backrest)  So if you have standard seating (or a touring/adventure style), this bag will do well for you as a pillion bag, and with a little strap adjustments, it also fits vertical on the front or back of a sissy-bar, or horizontal on a larger luggage rack... These are great, but they didn't come with a bag.  TheTri-Lynx 00015 Lynx Leveler for RV Leveling Block with Nylon Storage Case, (Pack of 10)comes with a very nice bag that would actually work well for these wheel chocks.  It would be nice if they had included that or another bag for these (that would have earned the product 5 stars). I purchased the 12' feet long cable set and they arrived in a retail cardboard box with handle, which could be used as a storage and carrying case for these cables, although I will not need to store them with the carry box.  These are high quality long cables of high grade materials and I believe worth the price I paid for them.  They will store in the back seat storage compartment of my truck easily.  Recomend. 
The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around! The &#34;feet&#34; on this bar slides off the truck bed sides and makes it worthless.When the ratchet is extended, the mechanism for that ends up out of arms reach when standing outside the truck. Two of thes pads, under my Camco RV jack stands, raise the stands to the proper heighth for my pop-up.  They don't slip or slide on hard or soft surfaces. 
it does a good job of cleaning easy to use make the car come clean and is easy to clean up I bought this to clean the brake dust that accumulates quickly on my wheels and takes forever to clean the old fashioned way with a spray cleaner and towels. I have BBS style wheels with about 16 splines and a ton of small hard to reach crevices. They take me about 45 minutes to clean by hand. With this wand cleaner, I can do them in about 10-15 minutes. It is very soft and well covered so the hard plastic rod doesn't poke through and scratch the wheel. I keep a towel handy to wipe the brake dust off the wand after each wheel since it builds up quickly. With a little care, I got it into all the small hard-to-reach crevices and cleaned them. I am very pleased with the product and it saves me a ton of time. The wheels still need a full cleaning once in awhile, but this does the trick most of the time. cleans very well removes brake dust and stuck on grime..need to spray on and let soak scrub with brush..hose off..if stains are old or been on rims for awhile you will have to do a second clean but it will remove 95% of grime 
This worked perfectly for my 2003 Ford Excursion.  It fit right over the tire and gave me the extra height I wanted to load bikes on the roof and a car top carrier.  Seems very sturdy and well made.  The bag that comes with it is a nice bonus feature.  I see what others have mentioned though about the adjustable step and folding it up in the bag.  If you place the step in any position except for the lowest, you will not be able to store it in the bag folded.  All that said, it will still fold up in that position and you could easily put a bunge around it and store it that way. I was looking for a Cargo bag to fit my new rear hitch cargo carrier.This unit fit well in the basket and carried lots of camping stuff.I used plastic bins to organize the contents.Even with 4 good size bins I still had room for more boxes on the 1st level.I topped it off with bedding and pillows.I liked that it didn't add too much weight as my cargo carrier is heavy to begin with.Decent quality and looks to be good water proof design. Exactly what I was looking for  - chocks that are light weight and cheap.  These nest together so don't take up a lot of space and therefore will fit under the back seat of my Jeep. I expect they will work much better than a rock. 
This sunshade is easy to use and folds up to a nice compact size that fits under my seat well. It's a quite large size so is made for an SUV or car that has a large windshield like my Toyota Prius. While it doesn't fit the Prius perfectly, it's the closest size to being perfect.At this price, I have no complaints with this and can recommend it. Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. Great Fit 
This product fits like it should and would look really nice if it had been shipped properly!  I got it and the box was all crunched.  The item had no cushioning around it and the front is bent in.  Need to return for a replacement!  It would have been 5 stars if the front had not been bent in and it was packed properly!  Fits right over my 3 burner RV stove and rest on the counter top.  I will be adding rubber feet so that it will scratch the sides of my stove nor my counter top!  To secure it you have to screw it to the counter top.  The back has a hing with 5 screw holes in it where you can secure it or it will stay put without screwing it down.  It came with 5 long screws.  Not sure if i want to secure mine yet.  I have a new RV and not sure i want to put screw holes in the knife holder behind the stove! I have a 2005 Suzuki C50 Cruiser (700lbs 93") and this cover does cover the bike without its hard bags attached. It does have multi-bars on it, which to are covered.  The bottom half of both tires are exposed.  I am able to connect the front bungee, but the middle one has to attach to the bike frame, as it will not reach to the hole on the opposite side of the bike.It has been raining for the last couple of days, so I plan to go check it out in a few more days, as it is expected to rain through tomorrow.I will adjust my review if there was any issue with wind and/or upper portion of bike getting wet or dusty despite the cover being in place.For now, I do suggest picking this up, as the price-is-right. The provided foam spacers and fit was perfect on my 2013 JEEP OEM hitch receiver.  Sturdy and well made.  The one I received had round corners so I did not have to 'modify' it as some other's stated they had to do.  I will not leave this permanently in my hitch and the weather, since there is potential for moisture to get into it.  If you put keys in this I'd suggest a zip log bag.  There are two holes in the back of the unit which I suspect is to allow moisture to escape, I thought about using Silicone RTV to close those up, but decided against it.  Weather, and especially near coastal areas, will probably corrode the combo lock at some point so I will not leave it permanently installed, and will keep in my cab until I need it. 
These did not fit my '08 suburban, the description said w/ 9x3 hook, so I assumed that to be included. It wasn't and I was unable to use these on my '08 suburban. I still use the square aluminum jack stands and I guess it really all depends on the brand you have or something cause these pads needed to be about 1/8&#34; bigger to fit mine so I was not pleased with that though I didn't have anything to block up my tongue when parked so these worked for that I guess. They need to make these things a TINY bit bigger then they can put a picture of a basic jack stand on the front .... till they do it;s really false advertising cause they do not fit either sets of my regular square aluminum jack stands. These don't fit quite right onto the stems of my Pirelli P-Zero's. The dealership neglected to put a cap back on my tire -- so I bought these just in case. They get the job done, but don't expect them to look or fit the same. 
I think I would have expected better instructions for a USA made product. However, there is a lot of available information on the internet and at other vendor websites, so the installation is very straightforward, simple even. I like the small profile and display options. You would also think that technology today would burn in the settings so that you do not need to keep the unit energized continuously. I do not drive my truck for weeks and I will not leave something that draws milliamps connected so I have to disconnect this when not in use. That was not clear in anything I read about it. I am reading lots of bad reviews on these pigtails.  What worries me the most is some seem to be shipping with a different thread type and people are stripping them trying to make them work.  Why the heck can't these be standardized?  I've also read that some come with different sizes of NPT as well as different thread types.  It seems that what is listed is not always what you order, and on top of that, someone like me, who does not know how to recognize the different thread types and sizes won't even know if I received the correct part or the wrong part.I recommend you double check your part number on the hose before installing them to avoid stripping your regulator.I thought, why not use quick connect hoses to connect my regulator to my appliance.  It seems these mate up nice to other quick connects--but only if made by CAMCO, and then these quick connect fittings don't mate up easily to the other parts like regulators etc.  WTF?  I need still another adapter?  And some people tell me perhaps multiple adapters to make it all work?  I'm not going to use three different adapters to mate up a quick connect.  That means I have a huge lunking thing sticking out ready to be damaged, knocked out of place, that is sure to leak out all my expensive propane.Ok, so I called CAMCO.  I wanted to be sure I ordered the right part and spoke to two different people at CAMCO that blew me off.  It seems Camco parts don't necessarily fit each other.  And they don't sell adapters to make them fit. It would be great if they could provide some customer support and perhaps make up some custom hoses to help people make things work.I give this a 1 star because CAMCO's huge fail in helping me put together a system that will allow me to hook up external tanks to my RV.One star also, because they ship different types of hose fittings and buyers don't know what they are getting.Honestly, I'd like to order one of every one of their parts and analyze them.  I'm an engineer, and if I can't figure out what to order, based on conflicting information--reviews that report receiving different size fittings 1/4&#34; npt than specified 3/8&#34; npt, and a multitude of part numbers--and a need for adapters when a buyer should be able to buy everything he or she needs without an adapter---it all tells me CAMCO has not thought out how their products are used.Think about it, there are only so many way propane tanks, hoses and appliances are hooked up. I don't see any need for adapter other than those that attach to the tanks. I'm one of the klutzy people who really can't manage technology, but I bought this one because my friend suggested it. I loved how easy this charger was to use, and it came with very easy to follow instructions. It's a really top notch product, and I recommend it to all my car-savvy chicks. 
This comes with 4 rubber feet that you install on the bottom.  Each foot is circular with a slot running from one side to the other that perfectly fits around the metal grate on top of RV stoves.  The board itself has pre-drilled pilot holes and a template that allows you to determine which holes to use for your particular stove.  It's a very well-done product.  The feet keep the unit in place during travel but it comes off easily when you want to use the stove.  The finish is very nice too so it looks excellent in place.  Highly recommend. What else can you ask for? 3 Ton and light weight plus locking mechanism is way safer than the wedge cuts in regular ramps.I suggest that they cover the top with a rubber pad or silicon piece to help protect car and stand Very small cars only. SUV or truck or large car tires do not fit well between the ridges and deform the product. I fastened the mat down with 4 tapcon concrete screws, each 2 inches long, into my garage slab. The leading edge of the mat tore off the screws and folded up. The adhesive strip behind the mat was also useless. I would have had better result with a 2 x 4 piece of fir or pine and concrete screwing it to the garage slab. You also have to aim the car perfectly when you park it because the mat is only as wide as the tire. I can't return it because it's damaged from use due to faulty design. Wasted my money. 
It's a leveler.  What more do you need to know really.  You can roll your trailer onto it to level it out,  Worked for me!  Just make sure to check weight of your load you plan on putting on it. Very good quality lock. It just takes some practice installing and removing withoutpinching your fingers or having this 3 lb. monster falling on your toes. Be sure to always keep one hand underneath it and your toes out from under it. Great way to keep your tongue jack from resting on wet ground or concrete, likely extending the life by not letting it rust out so quick.  Using with a tow package that includes a weight distribution assembly can prove problematic for smaller SUV's/cars though (tested with a 2008 Ford Escape with Class 3 hitch), as the tongue jack stand is so tall that you have to sometimes jack up your car up to clear it!  Still, I can't fault the jack stand for that.  Highly recommended. 
This would be a great idea if it actually wasn't too tall to fit inside our camper cabinets.  I measured this before ordering and thought it would fit.  But you really can't judge how your knives will fit in it from the description.  Most of our knives were too thick at the handle or too wide at the blade to sit down inside it fully.  Therefore they would stick up too high and would prevent the cabinet door from closing.  It was a waste and I didn't use it.I recommend instead buying a full knife set with holder and overall product dimensions, and doing some thoughtful measuring. I needed this item for an air compressor that draws 15A, and my 12V socket can only handle 10A.  This item is perfect, and small enough to fit in my air compressor's case.  It would be nice if we know how many amps it could handle, but the wire gauge provided is more than enough for my 15A need. How can one really rate it, as it is used for protection and no idae how long it should last, yet is was as listed so I give it the benifit ogf the doubt... 
I decided to try these out, and I'm glad I did! The black ones look really god in combination with the carbon fiber license plate frame I also got from Amazon -REAL 100% CARBON FIBER LICENSE PLATE FRAME TAG COVER FFSince most plates only use two screws, one set covers front and rear (If you are lucky enough to live where a front plate is required)The white ring mounts like a washer under your mounting screws, and the black cap just snaps over the top. Seems to hold well enough to not fall off, but they pull of easily if you have to get to your screws. Another reviewer mentioned that they trap water in and rusted his mounting hardware. That is good to know. I would suggest going with stainless steel mounting hardware just in case. (Which isn't a bad idea anyway) Very quick and easy mounting and really adds to the look of the rear of the Jeep.  These are metal and not a cheap plastic and mount with included screws into the existing lens cover screw holes. My dealer had put a plate frame on my motorcycle when I bought it but it covered part of the info (numbers and State) which is not legal in NC. I liked the look and price of this one and bought it. And it looks nice and frames the plate without covering any of the info on the plate. I did have to use a snipper to cut off the top of two of the barbs to get the screws in but you can't tell. 
Product shipped quickly. It is as described and will work fine for my vehicle. Do not order the Reese Power ball 72802 as the hitch mount is 3/4" and the draw bar is 1" mount. You'll need a bushing or return it for a larger mount. This product appears to include the cable. IT DOESN'T. It's just the mount which it does okay, but you'll have to buy the cable separately. Simple install, 2-wire hookup. Works as advertised. It can be installed at 2 different angles, gives an option for mounting. 
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Fit my '98 Nissan Frontier's oil pan perfectly. Looks to be of nice quality.  Torque to 25ft/lbs (on the Frontier anyway) 
Installed on a motorcycle works great.  Cord included allows for permanent install and can be used for accessories when not charging.  Great price. Solidly built adapter. Allows me to plug my trailer into the garage when using the lights, charging the batteries or cooling the fridge. A must have for the RVer. This adapter works, but the clips do not open wide enough to clamp on my battery posts. I was able to attach to the cables coming off the posts, albeit barely adhering. 
This may be something that would be nice to have in your emergency pack, but it is small, toylike and not really functional as a "flare"  The light that is generated is bright in both the flash and continous shine mode, but the light is directional.  It projects basically in one direction as opposed to being a genuine flare style that projects in a 360 degree radius.  For a carry-around for emergency use it would provide some help, but I think there are better flameless flares on the market that would work better.  This is a lower cost item, so you may want to consider that when you make a comparison.  I give it three out of 5 stars but I can't recommend it to anyone who may consider this to be a complete emergency flare solution. Pros: battery driven; flashing or steady light; flameless flare; can be used as a map light; reusable. Could be used effectively as a light that does not seriously degrade night vision.Cons: Product claims to be visible at 1000 ft, but this is only possible within a few degrees of view. One half of the top lights up for a dim presentation, but the bright LED shines out through a narrow beam like a small red flashlight. Consequently, the flare would probably not be useful in a traffic situation since it would have to be precisely aligned with oncoming traffic and would only be visible by the few drivers within this narrow beam of light. It is certainly not a good substitute for a real flare which is much brighter and omnidirectional. This little light is not as good as the emergency flashers built into vehicles.If you want a safety flare to carry in your vehicle, buy the real thing. If you want a light you can use as a map light without distracting a driver, or to see where you're walking without seriously degrading your night vision, this red light will do that well. This definitely catches your eye out on the road, which leads to safety through conspicuity.  It produces a clean hyper-white look without too much blue.  If you're looking for color, go with the PIAA GTX Anti-vibration.  I decided on this bulb to fly under the radar while maintaining the benefits of an aftermarket bulb.  Light output is good, but don't expect it to save you from mounting the driving lights you want anyway ;) 
Great wheel lock that is easy to activate and unlock.  It comes with 3 keys, one of which has a LED light on it.  The product also comes with a reminder cord that attaches to the handle bar as a reminder.  It does just what I was looking for. Simple install, and makes quick removal of antenna possible for those with low garages that do not want to damage antenna. Just as it says.  Easy to install, is good quality and functions just as it should.  To install, all that has to be done is to remove the four screws holding the fuel filler area finish ring in place.  The ring does not have to be removed.  Place the cover in place and use the provided screws to secure the cover.  That easy! 
Don't buy this rear wiper for a 1st generation xB, it will NOT fit! Get OEM or a wiper from elsewhere! Probably a good filter but didn't fit the application. Amazon made it right, but be sure this fits your car before buying. Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars 
Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.  The pickle fork is the last resort for me, as it will damage the balljoint boot.I prefer to use the Snap On balljoint remover.  If that one cannot fit, then I will try this tool.  If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork. Designed for a rv but works great in my daughters rentals refrigerator. Good fit and tight enough to hold food securely. Will buy again should I need them for something else.

Rain-X 800002243 Glass Treatment- 7 oz.It's simple, this stuff works great when applied correctly, the rain will slide right off! This is the best lubricant to use on your bike chain for quiet operation and rust protection. It has a deep penetrating action to reach every part of the chain. It even comes with a thin tube that fits into nozzle to apply a few drops to the chain. It will extend the life of the chain and of the gear derailleur systems.The built in solvents soften and remove dirt and contaminants while displacing water to prevent rust and corrosion. It does not leave behind a layer of grease to collect and hold dirt and sand and act as an abrasive to the bikes chain and gear system.Tri-flow reduces chain and gear cog wear. It is also great for the rear derailleur to maintain crisp and accurate gear changes and to keep all of the components moving smoothly. It also works on the front derailleur system the same way.Tri-flow contains petroleum lubricants and Teflon particles so make sure to shake it well before you use it. I use it to maintain my bikes. It has many other applications and just like it states on the label, it is a superior lubricant. Works as advertised, glass turns out very cleaned, almost even reflective at certain lights/angles.The best way to use this is to apply it like a wax - use one towel to spread it around, and a dry towel to &#34;buff&#34; it. It will show if you don't 
Great price and is what I was expecting it to be and do. Not sure how long it will last, time will tell. Not only do they not fit, very thin and wonder how long they will last.  Also if you have batteries with the post and screw/nut the latter is not covered. How can one really rate it, as it is used for protection and no idae how long it should last, yet is was as listed so I give it the benifit ogf the doubt...

I have many quality tools. I purchased this "Power Wrench" so I can put back the "name brand" breaker bars and sockets back into my tool cabinet. I chose this product bc it has both lug sizes that I needed to simplify tires changes between the factory wheels and aftermarket wheels as they use different size lugs. I do like the fact that the sockets are indeed 6 point and thin wall. But: I`m dissatisfied with the way the wrench locks into the extended range, the quality of the sockets and extension themselves beside the storage pouch that was included. In my order, the plastic package was cut in several locations, also cutting the cheaply made storage pouch. IMHO The storage pouch won`t last long at all.Now that I have the Power Wrench, I`m just going to keep this and chalk it up to lifes experience. If anyone is looking for a breaker bar and socket to simplfy their tire change, simply look elsewhere. I`m sure for the money spent you could pick up a cheap set up for less. I gave this a 3 star rating bc it is adequate and will do the job as intended, hopefully. Also IMHO if you are looking to give this as a gift, simply "PASS" and give your Gearhead loved ones a gift card to their favorite tool place. This is a nice item to have in your tool chest / box. I use it whenever I assemble things which may need to be taken apart again. I even use it on my vehicle wheel lugs, with good results. I recommend this item. I failed when purchasing this tool.  I was trying to substitute for the real full size kit to do some of my jobs.I stongly suggest that you don't follow in my foot steps.I couldn't even use it once.  Myabe it could have been that it didn't offer the right size or configuration for the car i was working on that day.  But there is something else that is wrong with going with a tool like this.  Even if it had the right size or configuration, If the caliper piston has come out too far for this tool to fit in between the caliper and the piston then it would render it useless.I would recommend Astro Pneumatic 78618 Brake Caliper Wind Back Tool Set - 18 Piece.  Whether it's for professional use or personal, I strongly suggest a tool like this one.  It's going to be worth the investment, trust me.  As of this review time it's currently $36.92 from Amazon.Good luck 
The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around! Easy to replace. It lacks Toyota instructions, but it is exactly like existing Toyota part with all wires colored the same way so it is very obvious how to connect those.The original part has a silicone rubber tube going all the way from top to bottom with wires running inside it. This part only provides a short length of tubing that, at best, would cover half of the length of wires on my car.I thing they should provide a &#34;telescoping&#34; tubing of two diameters with one going inside of the other while you are crimping wires and then extended to cover the full length of wires The quality of this tool appears good. Fit and finish are nice, and the steel base looks forged and not cast. The screw turns smoothly even if the handle is a bit sharpHowever the throat of this tool is not deep enough to get over what look liike normal sized wiper arms on my 2012 Jetta SportWagan. When placed on the arm the center of the threaded rod only reaches to the edge of the wiper arm stud. I got the tool to work but it involved leaving the wiper arm nut on the stud about 4 turns loose and placing a thick steel washer on top of the nut to make a flat surface for the puller stud to press against. 
Don't buy this rear wiper for a 1st generation xB, it will NOT fit! Get OEM or a wiper from elsewhere! The blade is good. The materials, construction, and water removal are all good. I tried the C-19-UB on the passenger side of my GS350 and it worked as well as the 24" factory one on the driver side. The Anco blade is molded with a spoiler, which makes it similar in appearance to the factory wiper of the GS350 which is the holder and the refill assembly. I rate the product 3 stars for the high cost not justified by any additional benefit over the factory blade refill.There two points I wanted to make are:1. Attention must be paid to letters -OE or -UB at the end of the blade model. I suggest using the Amazon fit guide at the top of the product page or visiting Anco website to find specific models that will fit your vehicle. I ordered -OE blades thinking -OE stood for Original Equipment. My family owns and previously owned Toyota/Lexus cars and I am only familiar with the "cane handle" type of a windshield wiper arm. Anco -OE blades will not fit this type of connector. Additionally, the Product Description says that the blade has an "OE-style spoiler", so it is even more confusing what OE in the model number refers to. Anyway, Toyota and Lexus have a "cane handle" type wiper arm and only blade models ending in -UB will fit this connector.2. I think these replacement blades are just too expensive. I usually buy wiper blade refills at the dealer for about ten dollars for two. These blades cost two to three times that (depending on the availability of a rebate). I tried a C-19-UB alongside with the factory 24" blade on my GS350 and I did not find Anco blade to clean the windshield any better than the factory blade does. On one of my previous cars, I tried Valeo 900 Ultimate blades (similar to Anco Contour). I had the same opinion that, although these replacement blades work well, they do not work better than factory refills, and their high cost makes them unappealing to me. I do not find that at 2-3 times the cost of factory refills, these blades work 2-3 times better. paid $3.17 here ....... cheaper than "wally world". I bought three as these work on my motorcycles. filters the dirt, protect my engine.the "classic" purolator filter is way better than a fram (more pleats of filter media) IMO.I'm using these on a Kawasaki EX 500 Ninja but the L14610 will fit any Kawasaki or Honda motorcycle that uses a cartridge oil filter and has enough room , these are approx. 3.25 inches in length .....Or you can use the L14612 which is shorter (2.5 inches in length).why give your hard earned money for the oem filters which are made as cheaply as the motorcycle manufacturer can buy them and branded with their logo.....crappy filters is what you get from the dealer..... I want my stuff to last, LOL. 
If you are considering purchasing this product for various uses at home, such as tires (cars and bikes, etc), mattresses, sport balls, and almost anything that need inflation, this product is the answer.Two cons: you'll need an extension cord and the PSI dial is not digital so you'll need to guessimate the actual PSI or you can get a digital pressure gauge to accurately measure your PSI. I always buy a few hoses, two 10 footers and a 15 ft hose. I then connect together the best combination lenth hose that will get from water source to RV. Keeps my camp area neat, plus why on hot days would I want the sun heat the water in the hose and have to wait for the water to get cool by running it. Just makes more sense adding what ya need together then 30 ft of hose sprawel out on your camp site. Most campsites you will end up using the 15 footer anyway. Don't buy this unit. Buy Camco 39062 RV Dual Flush Pro Holding Tank Rinser with Gate Valve instead.  This unit will let you back flush but guess what happens when you want to disconnect the hose.I guess it's only good for connecting a hose for extending the drain... 
Handy to have on the road to check air pressure in suspension and tires. Everyone knows fixaflat!Press it on your tire air valve, and let it fill up.Then fill up the tire with air (eg: by driving to the gas station).Ride around for a while, so the slime can settle.And voila! New life in an old tire!Don't use in a new tire, when you can plug it! I use it for my dual back tires in a Ford 350 chassis. It would not register the tire pressure accurately. It was hard to get a tight seal around the valve stem. I will try the CH tire inflater with the built in gauge and the chuck that hopefully will get a tight seal on the valve stem. 
I have seen this type of dual check tire inflator with gauge at many service stations. No more airing up then change to a gauge to read the pressure. Gets tiring if you are checking all the tires on an RV. With the build in gauge you get the reading constantly as you put air in the tires. This is going to be my main tool for the RV. Two cars and motorcycle plus one in garage for my compressor refills.  Bought this one on faith because so many liked this Michelin.  Getting a good seal on valve most immportant and accuracy of course.  This one seals easiest.  That is the best feature.  Tenths of one PSI is also handy if measuring cold tire.  Bulk weight and size less handy if in glove compartment?  Lots of other things in there.I keep this one in garage.  For me with three vehicles and ten tires the pressure memory not helpful.  The light might be nice.  Weight and bulk in my XL hand feels perfect when pressing on tire valve.  That is what the weight is there for?#####  Please let me suggest something for those who get their oil changed at those "quickie" places.  Part of their service is to check you tire pressure.  That is VERY BAD FOR YOUR TIRES.  You have to drive there for the oil change.  Your tires likely warmed up.They decided tire pressure was too high and LET AIR OUT.  Finally noticed tire profile looked low.  Shocked to see almost ten pounds low when cold.  Damn!  That is damaging if driven on freeway for long miles.  Overheats tire and wears faster.Tire pressure should always be check when cold.  Yes it will go higher with driving.  That is taken into account when manufacturer or car manu. recommends pressure setting.  No matter how high when hot ALWAYS CHECK PRESSURE WHEN COLD.  Jiffee Lube and others have good intentions (I hope) BUT tell them NOT TO CHANGE THE TIRE PRESSURE with WARM OR HOT TIRES.  ............and that's the truth, LOL THIS IS THE PERFECT TIRE PRESSURE GAUGE FOR CHECKING TIRE PRESSURE ACCURATELY, QUICKLY AND EASILY.  SIMPLY PUT THE END OVER THE VALVE STEM, HOLD IT FIRMLY FOR A SECOND OR TWO AND READ THE PRESSURE.  THE GAUGE ON THE NEW TIRE PUMP IS NOT CORRECT AND NEITHER IS THE PRESSURE GAUGE ON THE ELECTRIC TIRE PUMP THAT ATTACHES TO THE CIGARETTE LIGHTER. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE ACCUTIRE MS DIGITAL TIRE PRESSURE GAUGE. 
A must have tool to work on any car, if your check or fixing electrical problems, it makes the connecting and disconnecting that much easier, and you don't have to break anything with this tool!! This is one of the few well documented, safe and reasonably effective products you can add to your gas tank that will not harm any part of your engine and perhaps help various issues depending on what your car needs.  It is safe because it has been used for years in Chevron gasoline.  The highest concentration of it are in the premium grade.  There have been lots of studies done on Techron.  The only difference between a bottle of this and the Techron in the pump at the gas station is that the Techron in this bottle is a much higher concentration. The reviewer who said that Chevorn stations were disappearing did not know what he was talking about and as to his manual stating not to use additives that may or may not be the case but for Techron since it is in pump gas it makes no sense this product would be included.  It is designed to clean deposits in fuel injectors and carbs and to some degree help clean or prevent buildup of deposits on valves.  It may nor may not increase MPG, that is entirely dependent upon the issue you are having and how much a detergent added to your gas can clean. If your fuel injectors can have a better spray pattern then perhaps you could see minor increases in MPG.  It is more likely to help an engine run and idle smoother and have power closer to what it was new if the fuel system has become inefficient due to becoming dirty with deposits. In many instances it can help clean deposits to an extent where there is a noticeable improvement in how your engine idles because it has helped to unclog your fuel injectors.  Again it certainly is one product that will not in any event harm your engine. It also will very likely help keep those deposits from becoming an issue in the first place if used on occasion.  However this, like any other gas additive can only do so much. It is reasonable to try using it before moving on to a more expensive repair, but no gas additive can take the place of a mechanical cleaning or replacement or a fuel injector or repair of a damaged engine.  So if you are going to use a cleaning fuel additive this is one of the best and the safest to try.  Just remember there is no "engine rebuild in a can" and the bulk of products such as oil additive mask serious wear issues at best.  If you have relatively minor issues that could be helped by cleaning of the fuel delivery system this is one of the first easiest steps to take, along with changing fuel filters and any other maintenance that your car may need such as replacing spark plugs.  If this does not work there are machines at shops that are made for cleaning fuel injectors and related systems such as MotoVac which runs a cleaning fluid in a closed loop for a long period of time.  That is a step up from adding something to your tank. If that fails than a mechanical remedy is needed.  The only other two products I would consider using are made by Redline and Lucas.  They make good products in general and have had good reviews on their fuel system cleaners.  So feel safe trying this but don't expect miracles.  Proper engine maintenance is going to be your best and lowest cost way to avoid repairs and keep your car running like new more than any other thing you can do. Works perfectly on engine and transmission oil drain plugs on all cars and most valve gaskets on imports.  I use this stuff any where I can on the engine to prevent leaks happening. 
It does as advertised. Fit perfect on my car and at a fraction of the price the big box stores want to charge for so called upgraded features. These are all you need to keep your stems sealed. Just remember to keep your tires at proper pressure to save money on gas.If this review helped you please let me know. Thanks and happy shopping. changed engine oil on my equinox. just make sure it will work on your type of car. other wise it will give you pain like one of my friends. when it works, it is super cool. not a single drop of oil on the floor. Forget the rest. The others are only gimmicks compared to Chevron Techron. Techron absolutely works. It will remove the corn fuel tarnish from your engine and keep those injection needles clean. Yes, I said tarnish. Tarnish will build up in your engine, fuel lines and injectors if you are not using Techron. No, it doesn't matter if you have a 'flex fuel' automobile or not, this tarnish is akin to pancake syrup and will eventually ruin your engine. 
Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.  The pickle fork is the last resort for me, as it will damage the balljoint boot.I prefer to use the Snap On balljoint remover.  If that one cannot fit, then I will try this tool.  If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork. Could a wheel chock chock is a wheel chock could chock wheels?In this case: 2.Good build quality, worked well on my AG tires on the rear of the tractor. Your Hi Lift jack will not work well for you if you are off-road.  Sand = Nope. Mud = Nope.  Must have a wide base to make the jack work correctly. (I know from experience - ugh) 
This thing has 2 readouts and 4 scales and no instructions on how to read any of htem.  The SWR is easy enough to figure out but the others are anyones guess, came with some little wire antenna that is nowhere in the one sheet instruction that comes with it.  The signal strength meter dosn't seem to register at all.  It was cheap enough and probelly works, but your  have to find an engineer to tell you how to use it. Exact fit for my 2005 SV650.The instructions were clear - but probably because I watched the other reviewer's video on how to add the battery fluid. No problems encountered on my install. I was suprised how well and how easy they worked even on an extended van.  It saves wear and tear on the shoulders. 
I was a touch skeptical. But I can afford to throw it out if I don't like it.  Well I can say, I will NOT be throwing this out!  I was so impressed with how my cars looked when I was done that I had to ask my self. Why didn't I buy this sooner. And it is true. A little goes a long way. Cant say how it works until/if i ever need to remove the O2 sensor I used it to install.If i ever run out I will buy more. I probably should compare it to another to see how accurate it is, but I really like how easy it is to use and turns off and on by itself. 
This review needs to be prefaced with an important fact: I have no spare tire and don't have run flat tyres.I decided that I was sick of worrying about what I'd do if I got a puncture in a part of the country were 265/40R18's weren't common (these are for a Porsche, they're an extremely uncommon size).  I went on a bit of a tyre repair buying spree, buying this in addition to a giant bottle of slime goo and a more generic set of plugs.  My car did come with it's own tire goo, but I didn't want to rely on OEM tire goo as my only option.Well, I got a puncture last night that left my tire completely flat when I got back to my car this morning.  All of my previous punctures kept air just fine so I could get to the tire shop for a proper repair, but this one wouldn't hold air even with the screw still in the tire.I figured this would be just as good a time as any to try out this product, since the tire just didn't hold air at all.  Really easy to use, the instructions were simple and clear.  I highly recommend their suggestion of using water on the plugs, otherwise it catches on the tool.  I put the first plug in, and it was leaking air just as much as with the screw.  I put in a second plug and it let out just a little bit of air, but much less.  I thought I'd just leave it at that, but in the end I put a third plug in.  It was completely sealed up, and water doesn't bubble up on it.  That was about 6 hours ago, and I just checked and it's held the same pressure as when I filled it up at the gas station.  I took the wheel off the car because I was safely in a garage, but I could see doing this on the side of the road with the Porsche air compressor.This isn't an expensive or interesting product, but what I love about is that it gives me more confidence when driving my completely impractical car on road trips!  I'm buying a new set of tires (the puncture was on a nearly worn out set of tires), so I can't attest to long term reliability, but I can say that for punctures which leave the tire intact, this product can help you get to a place to fix your tires for real!  I don't know whether this is considered a long term fix or not, but I won't be using it for tires I plan on using on the freeway. I have a 1993 M35A3 with 6 Michelin 14.5 XLs and a spare.  The CTIS (central tire inflation system) had been disconnected, and the split wheel o-rings need to be replaced.  This means that I have 7 huge tires with slow leaks.  I have the truck in an apartment complex parking lot with no electricity for my big Makita 5hp compressor.  And my honda generator cant crank over the Makita.  I had a little red compressor from VIAR, which was good in the emergency I needed it for, but got so hot in inflating these tires that it melted the yellow hose.The 450P was hooked up to my yellow goodyear hose and Subaru Outback (running), and put to work right out of the box.  It took 5 of these tires from 15 lbs or less to 45 lbs in about 35 minutes.  When you have 13,000 lbs of truck, having tires that roll is critical, because even a wrecker can't move them with deflated tires.  The pump was hot, but the inflating pipe on the compressor runs through the padded handle, which allows you to pick it up when hot.  The gauge has a trigger and a  lever that holds fitting on to the tire valve, which is really handy.  Having a switch vs using the battery clamps to start saves on sparking.I was at a loss as to how I was going to get these tires inflated in remote situations with out a huge generator to run a huge compressor...so this continuous duty 12v pump was very timely.(for those of you who are military truck experts, I am aware the M35A3 has an on board compressor, but there is a blockage somewhere ahead of the 'glad hands.')  The M35A3 is about the largest truck (23,000 lbs gvw) you can drive in NC without a license , and has 7 really big tires to say grace over.  This is not a replacement for a functioning CTIS or a big compressor, but will get even the largest tires inflated and rolling. I bought this for my viar 85 p with the 12 foot extension so for 14 bucks I have 14 more feet . Just be careful to make sure the wires are not near moving parts or the hot manifolds . Works well . I pump one tire , let it cool a few minutes and do another . Would work with the pump to plug a tire on the side of the road without taking off the car . Just pump up the flat , spray windex to find the leak . Clean it out , plug , and inflate . Then cut off the excess in 15 min if you used glue like you should for a permanent plug . If I ever find the time I hope to mount a female ligher adapter direct off the battery  next to my hitch so I can reach a trailer tire now I need to either unhitch the tow vehicle and move back or take the tire off . I am disabled so it is difficult but I recently bought a impact wrench so I am looking for a good jack as my tow vehicle uses a bumper one not useable for the trailer . The viar 85 p will blow up a 15 inch tire in about 1 min 45 seconds from flat so the wires do not get hot , just let it cool a equal amount before doing the next . If your just topping off it is no problem . Puts in 10 pounds in under a minute . 
This thing is Awsome.  It has all a camper or over the road traveler needs for emergency power and presurized air.  Comes with Battery Cables, Air Pressure Hose and Coinnections, Instruction Booklet (a must read), and several types of power outlets.  You will need an electrical extension cord, which is not included, to charge it up via AC Outlet, or you can charge it up via the 12Volt Auto Lighter Adapter Cord, which is included, but which I would not recomend unless you have no other source of power, because this thing looks like it packs a punch.  I like it and think it's worth the money.  I just started using it so Icannot speak to its durability, bt otherwise it is Awsome.  Recomend. It keeps my batteries topped off and I don&#8217;t have to watch it like a trickle charger so that&#8217;s a real plus. I drive very little so the vehicles sit for weeks between trips. My 1990 Chevy K2500 doesn&#8217;t have much in electronics&#8230; though it does have a slow power drain that I could never find&#8230; so a battery disconnect switch was the best answer. My Ford Expedition is another story so this tender is what it needed. The battery weakens in sub-zero weather so that it does not always start the vehicle and I thought buying a new battery was the way to go. Last time I did so it was a few years ago&#8230; both vehicles take the same size battery&#8230; and it cost about 85 bucks but it&#8217;s now 125 bucks&#8230; ouch! If that&#8217;s all I needed I would give it 5-stars and be done. However, what is supplied with it was not adequate for my needs&#8230; and likely so for many others&#8230; so it gets 3-stars because I had to modify all three cords to make it workable on my two vehicles.I think the best way to use something like this is to have the ability to easily detach it so you can drive off&#8230; like with a block or dipstick heater that have cords that reach the grill so you can just unplug the extension cord. If your vehicles are parked outside near an outlet&#8230; like mine&#8230; this option isn&#8217;t available with what&#8217;s provided with this unit. The Ring Terminal and the Alligator Clamp cords are about 18&#8221; long so if your battery is in the back of the compartment the plug will not reach to the grill. I don&#8217;t like routing it out over the fender and under the hood because you can cut the wire off. The cord from the unit is only 12&#8217; long so that won&#8217;t make it from the outlet inside the garage to the vehicles &#8230; you have to keep this unit out of the weather&#8230; and the extension cord for it is about 11 bucks. Even if it does reach from outlet to battery the connectors are still under the hood so you still have to raise the hood to disconnect it. It also does not come with a cigarette lighter adapter as with some other models. I used some leftover wire I had to make my own extension&#8230; by cutting the 18&#8221; cord and splicing in some wire&#8230; to get the plugs to the grill and that seems to be working fine. I also purchased a cigarette adapter from China for under a buck&#8230; with free shipping&#8230; and added some flat plugs to make my own adapter. Without making my own accessories&#8230; or a purchase of about 20 bucks&#8230; I would have to place the unit under the hood and route an extension cord to it&#8230; and then have to pop the hood to remove it. It seems adding some longer wires to these connectors would not have been all that difficult and well worth paying a few bucks more to get it. There&#8217;s not much in a vehicle that&#8217;s 18&#8221; away from you&#8230; or a 13.5&#8217; when you add the cable from the unit&#8230; when you&#8217;re parked outside. Also, the more cable you add to this the unit the greater the voltage drop and the longer it has to operate to top off the battery. If the cable lengths aren&#8217;t an issue for you, or you don&#8217;t mind spending more money for the extras, then it&#8217;s likely a 5-star unit. I doubt you would need to do anything to make it workable on anything other than a car or truck. This replaces my previous one of these that just failed after 8 years of good service keeping my summer only vehicles' batteries charged over winter storage. You will likely need to get one or more accessories such as the 12 volt extension cords so you can reach all your vehicles, cigarette lighter plug-in instead of standard battery clips that come with the unit, etc. Highly recommended. Also have the two bank unit that was causing am radio interference on the house circuit, returned it under warranty and they repaired it on a timely basis. I am able to get very long battery life using Battery Tender products. 
The worst possible thing to do to a lead acid battery is to let it fully discharge.  I keep Battery Tenders on all my equipment batteries and have never had a battery fail in less than 8 years.  I did have one Battery Tender Jr go bad but the company replaced it for the $7 shipping fee. I now have 5 Battery Tender Plus chargers. Ever since I started keeping my little used batteries on a Battery Tender, I have not had a battery failure.When I first bought my Generator (over 15 years ago) the starter batteries would only last a couple years because the Generator was used so infrequently, sometimes not for a couple years. Since then, I now leave a Battery Tender connected and also start the Generator once a year. The current battery in my Generator has now been in for almost 10 years!I had to replace the battery recently (2 years ago) in my Polaris 800 ATV because it kept going dead (after couple months) because I didn't keep it on a charger (it sits in a shed with no electricity). I didn't think it would be a problem because I use the ATV 4-5 times a year. But modern AGM and Freedom Batteries cannot tolerate repeated deep discharges. I knew better but was too lazy to keep pulling the battery out or running a very long extension cord to the shed. Now I remove the battery and keep it connected to a Battery Tender.I could site many more instances where I am now getting triple or even greater life from equipment or vehicle batteries by keeping them connected to a Battery Tender Plus. Given that even a small ATV battery costs upwards of $60, the cost of a Battery Tender will pay for itself in a few years.And Battery Tenders have a 10 year warranty, unheard of for any battery charger. I am very pleased with this battery maintainer.  I purchased the cigarette light plug along with this unit and it is so easy to use.  I plugged it in, set it to normal charge and brought a totally discharged battery back to life.  The battery is holding the charge just fine and I couldn't be happier.  I especially like the &#34;supply&#34; mode on this unit so I can change out a battery without losing the codes on my car.  No one should be without this charger.  I have a car that sits in the garage and used sparingly and this device keeps the battery fully charged. 
Great for those batteries that you don't use year round on motorcycles, rvs, lawn mowers, etc.Like it enough to purchase a double one the following year. Why I went so many years using a C clamp is beyond me. This is SO much easier. It seems to be solidly built and I see many years of use in my future. For 30 years, I have been fighting with dead batteries on seasonal vehicles like ATVs, mowers, tractors and emergency generators.  In spite of my best efforts, I always managed to miss at least one battery when making my charging rounds every month or so.Batteries can be stubborn.  They only turn up dead when you need them the most.A life span of 12 months for a 12V lawn and garden battery was acceptable. After all, the warranty is only 3 months.Some motorcycle and ATV batteries cost as much as a car battery and 12 months was about the best I could hope for.About 4 years ago, I began using the Battery Tenders on all of my seasonal and special use batteries.  My 12V lawn and garden and ATV batteries are lasting between 3 and 4 years now.The big 12V, 72-month generator battery might last forever.  It went out of warranty in 2010.Lawn & garden batteries cost about the same as the Battery Tender Junior which means that I'm saving about $48.00 every 3 years on each piece of equipment that uses such a battery.If I'd been using Battery Tenders on my ATVs for the past 30 years, I could have retired much earlier. 
Awesome. You could run a regular (probably orange) extension cord through your garage and then have your battery tender plugged into it on the floor and trip over it constantly or you could buy one of these extensions made for the tender and have it run along your ceiling inconspicuously or run along the baseboard of a wall out of sight and then have it come up right where you need it for your car, truck or motorcycle. This worked great to plug right into my battery tender. I set up my mustang, tractor and RV with plugs so I can easily plug any of them into the charger and unplug them easily with no clamps.  No worries about a clamp coming off and shorting out things either. Our Battery Tender Plus is on a shelf in the garage, and the RV with its battery is parked outside.  This cable runs from the charger to the wall of the garage, down to and thru a vent hole in the wall, then across the driveway, under the RV, then up front to the battery box.  It turned out to be just long enough.  When we leave on a trip, I turn off the charger, then coil the cable beside the garage till we return.  We no longer worry about fast-charging the battery every month or so during the winter to keep it from freezing. 
Was great to attach to my spare battery so as to attach heated wear or any thing that I wish to take away from the trike that requires 12 volts. Sure the switch placement sucks,but I do like the pump overall.I can plug in to a 120 outlet or use the 12 volt car accessory outlet. My bike came with a Yuasa battery and I"ve heard good things about Yuasa.  So why not buy a charger from the same company that makes your batter??Its nice to have the two types of batter connectors.  I mount the hard-wire kit to my motorcycle and whenever it will sit for a while, i can charge the battery without needing to take off the seat, etc to get to the batter.  Then you also have the alligator clips to use when you need to charge other batteries like lawn equipment. 
The perfect battery charger/maintainer for two batteries simultaneously. Appears to be well made, easy to follow directions, works like a charm, does what it says it will do. I have always been hard on deep cycle batteries and am hopeful this product will extend the life of my batteries by making it easy to charge, but not over-charge, and maintain them when they are not in use. The Battery Tender Junior 12V Charger comes complete with everything needed to charge your 12V battery.  I purchased this model to specifically charge my motorcycle battery and I am pleased to say that the unit works great.  It is a very compact charger and is supplied with several attachments to ensure that your battery is kept in an optimum condition.I made the permanent hard wire attachment to my battery using the color coded leads connected directly to the appropriate positive & negative terminals on the battery. The opposite female end has an end cap which can cover the inlet when not in use. When I know that I will not be hitting the road for an extended period of time, I simply plug the unit in to maintain my existing battery's power supply.Battery Tender makes larger charging units, but this battery charger is great for charging everything from batteries for ATV's and motorcycles to scooters and lawn mowers. Because of it's very discreet size it does not take up any needed space. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to protect their battery investment and do not want to compromise space and versatility. i use these for aftermarket batteries for 12v power wheels. can charge with a battery tender and fit together nicely

What can I say? It does what it says and I like the weight of it...makes it feel solid. I also like the LED light they put in so you can take the pressure in the dark/dim light. I like the Junior and just let it sit and charge. The green LED light stays on and lets you know the battery is 100%. No issues. I like that it comes with two sets of cables. This is not a booster pack for people who don't know how to use one. There's no safety features. No off switch. No silly blinking lights and pumps and sirens. It's meant to start a dead vehicle and that's exactly what it does. The long cables make it easier to use than some others as well. The voltage gauge is a great feature too, as it lets you know how much is left in it rather than just a couple lights. 
At less then $10 this is a steal!  The unit is well made and really does a nice job.  It's far bettter then the round adapter that plugs straight in and that on the back side you plug in the 30 amp cord.  The 90 degree 15 amp plug emliminates the problem of the cord pulling out or partially disconnecting from the outlet. Solidly built adapter. Allows me to plug my trailer into the garage when using the lights, charging the batteries or cooling the fridge. A must have for the RVer. It does what it is supposed to do, that is to increase placement distance from the car to the electrical outlet 
After a power outage, I connected my refrigerator to this power supply. Sadly, its inverter was unable to support my refrigerator. The Duracell DPP-600HD doesn't have enough momentary  output to handle the initial start-up current spike of a refrigerator's compressor motor. The specifications say it can momentarily provide up to 960 watts. This equates to 8 amps at 120v.  Yet, public benchmark figures for a home refrigerator's start-up current indicate 13 amps for up to 1/2 second. Other appliances that use electric motors such as sump pumps are likely to exhibit the same characteristics. My suggestion is that customers immediately test this product with any device they intend to power during an outage.Some important specifications are missing in the Amazon listing.  One of the key statics is the capacity of the internal battery, which is 28 amp-hours at 12 v.  This equates to 336 watt hours.  Yet, AC output is much lower than this presumably due to inverter losses.  These losses increase with power output.  The following table illustrates this.  The last column is my calculation.load.................watts....hours....watt-hoursCordless telephone.....5........35.0 ...175Portable stereo.........10........22.0 ...220Laptop computer.......20........7.0 ....140Fan.......................100.........1.7....17036" TV...................133........1.2 ....1603/8 drill.................300........0.4 ....115Warm-air fan heater.312........0.4 ....109Blender..................385........0.3 ....109HID Floodlights.......400........0.3.....107Observe that the total energy delivered (watt-hour) drops with power consumption.  Ultimately, the usable energy is significantly less than what is contained within the lead acid battery.For reference, a refrigerator will use about 200 watts of electricity when the compressor is running. Typical consumers will have their refrigerator running about 50% to 60% of the time, which equates to an average of 100-120 watts being consumed continuously.ConsDoesn't handle current spikes associated with certain electric motorsProsBoth AC and DC outputPortableSimple operation Nice high amp (current) rating on this. I epoxy it to a 12ah  12 volt gel battery and I can use it as a jumpstarter oremergency power supply for camping or power outages. I ordered 2 different chargers to maintain my gate opener's deep cycle battery (a simple 4 output charger with extension cords for charging other deep cycle batteries from amazonBattery Tender 022-0148-DL-WH 12V 4-Bank Battery Management System) and this unit has a far superior charging design.The 4 bank battery tender does a simple fast rate charge then switches to a trickle charge at a constant voltage with 4 outputs.This unit pulses the battery under charge and features 3 operating modes with different current outputs for different sized batteries. The selections are motorcycle which also works well for SLA gel cells or AGM batteries, standard automotive starting battery, deep cycle batttery, and off.What makes the CTEK unit special is that it uses a pulse charge in all modes to attempt to desulphate batteries, while the battery tender does not.  This method of charging has proven successful in restoring lead acid batteries that won't take a charge any more.It comes with a waterproof 12V output cable and a set of clips or rings for permanent installation under the hood of your car.  In addition to the LEDs for indicating the type of battery being charged, a second set is provided for empty, 1/2 full, and maintenance pulse charge mode.There is also a noticable increase in quality between the battery tender and this unit - small details like a water sealed housing and gaskets on the connectors indicate quality in manufacture.For a single 12V lead chemistry battery this is a useful, well made tool. 
I ordered one of these for my 2008 Saturn Vue. Package marked for 2008 Vue but item did not work. Contacted storefront who fullfilled order for Amazon and was referred to Curt mfg. to obtain return number. Then had to contact seller again. Got a refund but I purchased a replacement from a local dealer. Seller later reported a wrong item number was somehow in the package. When I ordered this, I was guaranteed fitment on a Toyota 3S-FE engine. When it arrived, it was not the correct size. i left two stars because I did run out and buy the correct size from another store, however, I didnt want to have to do this when I had all the rest of my parts shipped in. I ordered and paid for next day air because I needed it this weekend.  It arrived, but it wasn't what I ordered.  I ordered a pair of jack stands.  I received an engine hoist leveler.I understand mistakes happen.. but it was the way the return has been handled that I have issues with.  UPS dropped it off, but I have to take it to the post office to send it back?  And I wasn't told if they'll wait to ship the right order until they receive this back via the slowest mail service.. so I have no idea when the replacement order will arrive.  A week?  Two weeks?This wasn't my mistake or even a defective product.. this was human error on their part.  They should have told me they'd IMMEDIATELY ship the replacements next day like I ordered.  So far I'm left hanging.  Should I go out locally and get what I need and then end up with an extra set?  Should I hold off a day because they're coming next day?  I don't know.. and that's the point and that's why I gave them one star. 
very good Very good.... Good for 15,000 miles. I won't run mine that long, but it does give me the confidence to fun the full 7,500 miles suggested by Ford for my Focus ST. 
Of all the battery chargers on the market, the Battery Tender is the best.  The device is small and portable, works exceptionally well for maintaining batteries and does not over charge (over charging can decrease the overall life of your battery).  It is simple to operate and can be left hooked up to a dormant battery while it is not in use.  The Battery Tender can be used while the battery is hooked up to a vehicle/mower/etc. or not.  Highly recommended. I comparison shop a lot before buying anything - hopefully you can benefit from my time investment and review. I see a lot of negative reviews for this charger that I think are partially due to Amazon's incorrect description and the fact that most people don't know what size or type of charger they need. (including myself)I am a practicing Electronic engineer with more than 20yrs experience. I did not know much about battery chargers until recently researching what a good battery charger should do.1) this charger only delivers a max of 1.5A. This means if you try to charge a discharged auto battery (48AH) it will take a long long time. This charger does work great for topping off a car battery at 70% (12.4V).2) The instructions included clearly state the charger will automatically shut-off after 12 hours of charging. The charger will restart and continue charging if you unplug and then plug the charger in again. Best to get a higher capacity charger.3) This charger does have a float mode sort of. Actually it shuts off the charging current and monitors battery voltage. When the battery voltage drops low enough the charger cycles on to top it off and then shuts off again.MY SUMMARY 1st:I like this charger and think it does a good job for the PRICE. Gold box special was $15.20 + tax. (I would definitely buy it at the regular price for $3$)It's basically automatic. Don't have to set the voltage and it won't damage anything if you reverse the clips accidently. Compact size and reasonable quality clamps.This charger does what it is designed for. That is charge small batteries and top off larger automotive batteries. This is an excellent maintenance charger for all batteries to keep them fully charged when not in use. (My opinion)Personally I would not leave any charger connected to my battery for more than 24 hours. Now I use a cheap mechanical timer that is set to turn on for 1 hour every 24 hours. I would prefer a timer that I can set to turn on twice a week for a few hours.The charger is small feels solidly built with heavy plastic. It gets very warm aftercharging at 1.5A but not warm enough to be concerned. (no cooling fan)I gave this charger 5 stars because PRICE and performance is very good. Build quality is good as well.AMAZON DESCRIPTION (Poor): is incorrect in that this charger is not intended to be used to charge a LOW (discharged) car battery. The chart in the DESCRIPTION that shows the charging times is different than the manual.. The included MANUAL has a chart that states this charger should only be used as a "top off" or maintenance charger for auto batteries. In addition the charger in charging mode automatically shuts off after 12 hours of charging. (A good safety feature in my opinion.)Charging details:I discharged a car/truck jump start battery pack to 12.45V or approx 75% charge.(Typical full charge is 12.65V to 12.7V. To discharge the battery I used a battery/alternator tester. I have a voltmeter attached to charger and a current meter in series with battery and battery charger negative terminal.1) At the start of the charge, the charge current was 0.78A and then jumped to 1.52A in a few minutes.2) After 1 hour the charge current is 1.47A. Charge voltage is 13.0V.3) After 2 hours the charge current is 1.48A. Charge voltage is 13.25V.4) After 3 hours the charge current is 1.43A. Charge voltage is 13.46V.5) After 4 hours the charge current is 1.40A. Charge voltage is 13.82V.Note: that the charge current is decreasing as the battery is approaching full charge. This design feature will prevent overheating and extend the life of your battery.6) After 5 hours the charge current is 0.68A. Charge voltage is 14.71V.7) After 5.5 hours the charge current is 0.35A. Charge voltage is 14.67V.8) After 6 hours the charge current is 0.29A. Charge voltage is 14.73V.9) After 6.5 hours the charge current is 0.24A. Charge voltage is 14.72V.10) After 8.5 hours the charge current is 0.20A. Charge voltage is 14.73V.11) After 10.5 hours the charge current is 0.15A. Charge voltage is 14.71V.12) After 11.5 hours the charge is COMPLETE and the charge current has dropped to 0.0A. BATTERY voltage is 13.55V and declining. Charger is in the monitor mode. In monitor mode the charger AC power is 3W measured with a Belkin Watt meter.Almost 12 hours seems like a long time to charge a battery and this isn't even a full capacity car battery. But, it did a good job of gently charging the battery especially when it was near full charge. The important thing to me is the charging current declined as the battery neared full charge. This prevents overcharging and truly tops off the battery to maximum capacity.I tested the battery the next day with a battery tester and it passed well within the "good battery" full charge limits. The results were much better than the charger that came with the battery pack where it tested NEAR "weak".Very happy with the purchase. I would buy this exact model again. Should there be any problem(s) in the future I will update this review.Ships from and sold by Amazon. I have used this charger many times to charge the battery in a car that sits outside and I rarely drive. The voltage and percent charge display is very nice.  Very easy to use 
I use it every year to maintain the charge on the lawn tractor batteries.  Doesn't take too long and the indicator lights make it easy to know when the battery is fully charged. This is a great little charger unit.  It is not actually a battery maintainer like some of the real expensive units out there.  I have a &#34;BatteryMinder Unit&#34; which is a real maintainer but at 5 times the cost too! ($85)  This will charge a battery, and will float the charge at a very low rate of charge input to &#34;maintain&#34; the full charge level.  For the money it costs, this is a very nice little unit.  If you are using it on a large car or truck battery, this will maintain the charge, but is a bit small to attempt to charge a low or dead battery if it is a large one.  For small batteries and such, this will charge them just fine.  I use it to maintain a motorcycle battery with no problem.  Schumacher is an excellent long time company and with Amazon's guarantee you won't go wrong.  Enjoy! I see a lot of negative reviews for this charger that I think are partially due to Amazon's incorrect description and the fact that most people don't know what size or type of charger they need. (including myself)I am a practicing Electronic engineer with more than 20yrs experience. I did not know much about battery chargers until recently researching what a good battery charger should do.1) this charger only delivers a max of 1.5A. This means if you try to charge a discharged auto battery (48AH) it will take a long long time. This charger does work great for topping off a car battery at 70% (12.4V).2) The instructions included clearly state the charger will automatically shut-off after 12 hours of charging. The charger will restart and continue charging if you unplug and then plug the charger in again. Best to get a higher capacity charger.3) This charger does have a float mode sort of. Actually it shuts off the charging current and monitors battery voltage. When the battery voltage drops low enough the charger cycles on to top it off and then shuts off again.MY SUMMARY 1st:I like this charger and think it does a good job for the PRICE. Gold box special was $15.20 + tax. (I would definitely buy it at the regular price for $3$)It's basically automatic. Don't have to set the voltage and it won't damage anything if you reverse the clips accidently. Compact size and reasonable quality clamps.This charger does what it is designed for. That is charge small batteries and top off larger automotive batteries. This is an excellent maintenance charger for all batteries to keep them fully charged when not in use. (My opinion)Personally I would not leave any charger connected to my battery for more than 24 hours. Now I use a cheap mechanical timer that is set to turn on for 1 hour every 24 hours. I would prefer a timer that I can set to turn on twice a week for a few hours.The charger is small feels solidly built with heavy plastic. It gets very warm aftercharging at 1.5A but not warm enough to be concerned. (no cooling fan)I gave this charger 5 stars because PRICE and performance is very good. Build quality is good as well.AMAZON DESCRIPTION (Poor): is incorrect in that this charger is not intended to be used to charge a LOW (discharged) car battery. The chart in the DESCRIPTION that shows the charging times is different than the manual.. The included MANUAL has a chart that states this charger should only be used as a "top off" or maintenance charger for auto batteries. In addition the charger in charging mode automatically shuts off after 12 hours of charging. (A good safety feature in my opinion.)Charging details:I discharged a car/truck jump start battery pack to 12.45V or approx 75% charge.(Typical full charge is 12.65V to 12.7V. To discharge the battery I used a battery/alternator tester. I have a voltmeter attached to charger and a current meter in series with battery and battery charger negative terminal.1) At the start of the charge, the charge current was 0.78A and then jumped to 1.52A in a few minutes.2) After 1 hour the charge current is 1.47A. Charge voltage is 13.0V.3) After 2 hours the charge current is 1.48A. Charge voltage is 13.25V.4) After 3 hours the charge current is 1.43A. Charge voltage is 13.46V.5) After 4 hours the charge current is 1.40A. Charge voltage is 13.82V.Note: that the charge current is decreasing as the battery is approaching full charge. This design feature will prevent overheating and extend the life of your battery.6) After 5 hours the charge current is 0.68A. Charge voltage is 14.71V.7) After 5.5 hours the charge current is 0.35A. Charge voltage is 14.67V.8) After 6 hours the charge current is 0.29A. Charge voltage is 14.73V.9) After 6.5 hours the charge current is 0.24A. Charge voltage is 14.72V.10) After 8.5 hours the charge current is 0.20A. Charge voltage is 14.73V.11) After 10.5 hours the charge current is 0.15A. Charge voltage is 14.71V.12) After 11.5 hours the charge is COMPLETE and the charge current has dropped to 0.0A. BATTERY voltage is 13.55V and declining. Charger is in the monitor mode. In monitor mode the charger AC power is 3W measured with a Belkin Watt meter.Almost 12 hours seems like a long time to charge a battery and this isn't even a full capacity car battery. But, it did a good job of gently charging the battery especially when it was near full charge. The important thing to me is the charging current declined as the battery neared full charge. This prevents overcharging and truly tops off the battery to maximum capacity.I tested the battery the next day with a battery tester and it passed well within the "good battery" full charge limits. The results were much better than the charger that came with the battery pack where it tested NEAR "weak".Very happy with the purchase. I would buy this exact model again. Should there be any problem(s) in the future I will update this review.Ships from and sold by Amazon. 
i like how short this terminal connector is, much shorter then other 7-way plugs i have seen.  the light are great to verify that you are getting power through the plug. Not only do they not fit, very thin and wonder how long they will last.  Also if you have batteries with the post and screw/nut the latter is not covered. This tender answers a problem that I have had for several years. How to charge more than one battery at a time with only 1 outlet available for use in my garage.Works great and I really like the plug in adapters. They are the standard SAE type plug. This charger simply plugged into my bikes, since I have been using these adapters all along. (This charger comes with 2 adapters that have eyes that you hook up directly to your battery post screws/bolts, and 2 alligator clips that simply clip on to the battery posts. Both styles are fuse protected with a standard 7.5A ATO bladed fuse). 
I ordered 2 different chargers to maintain my gate opener's deep cycle battery (a simple 4 output charger with extension cords for charging other deep cycle batteries from amazonBattery Tender 022-0148-DL-WH 12V 4-Bank Battery Management System) and this unit has a far superior charging design.The 4 bank battery tender does a simple fast rate charge then switches to a trickle charge at a constant voltage with 4 outputs.This unit pulses the battery under charge and features 3 operating modes with different current outputs for different sized batteries. The selections are motorcycle which also works well for SLA gel cells or AGM batteries, standard automotive starting battery, deep cycle batttery, and off.What makes the CTEK unit special is that it uses a pulse charge in all modes to attempt to desulphate batteries, while the battery tender does not.  This method of charging has proven successful in restoring lead acid batteries that won't take a charge any more.It comes with a waterproof 12V output cable and a set of clips or rings for permanent installation under the hood of your car.  In addition to the LEDs for indicating the type of battery being charged, a second set is provided for empty, 1/2 full, and maintenance pulse charge mode.There is also a noticable increase in quality between the battery tender and this unit - small details like a water sealed housing and gaskets on the connectors indicate quality in manufacture.For a single 12V lead chemistry battery this is a useful, well made tool. I got a power plug to power plug style &#34;jumper&#34; device for my daughter, in case the 12V battery on her Prius dies.  Since the Prius doesn't use the 12V battery to start the motor, she doesn't need real jumper cables.  However, it's a keyless ignition, so she will not be able to jump power plug to power plug.  The battery on the Prius is has small terminals, so these are a nice size and should do the job of getting power from someone else's light to her battery. PROS:Indicator light while charging. Shows when charging is complete.AC power cable.Easy to get inexpensive terminal adapters so you can leave them on your vehicle and trickle charge as necessary.

The Battery Tender Junior 12V Charger comes complete with everything needed to charge your 12V battery.  I purchased this model to specifically charge my motorcycle battery and I am pleased to say that the unit works great.  It is a very compact charger and is supplied with several attachments to ensure that your battery is kept in an optimum condition.I made the permanent hard wire attachment to my battery using the color coded leads connected directly to the appropriate positive & negative terminals on the battery. The opposite female end has an end cap which can cover the inlet when not in use. When I know that I will not be hitting the road for an extended period of time, I simply plug the unit in to maintain my existing battery's power supply.Battery Tender makes larger charging units, but this battery charger is great for charging everything from batteries for ATV's and motorcycles to scooters and lawn mowers. Because of it's very discreet size it does not take up any needed space. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to protect their battery investment and do not want to compromise space and versatility. Nice high amp (current) rating on this. I epoxy it to a 12ah  12 volt gel battery and I can use it as a jumpstarter oremergency power supply for camping or power outages. 
I've an Optima in my old Corvette that has now failed.  I've have read thru their warranty information.  It states that the battery must be returned to the selling dealer for warranty service.  It cannot be returned to Amazon for any reason.  Therefore my question is this:If the battery purchased thru amazon should require warranty service, how is this done and by whom? I preferr this over the other brands due to warranty. Battery Tender warranty a joke, They charge shipping and repair cost under their warranty. I replaced my Battery Tender w/ these. I have used this brand on my tractor and 4 wheelers. I am getting over 5 years of battery life on both w/ this. Many automobile manufacturers, including BMW, claim that the transmission oil is a &#34;lifetime fill&#34; in order to avoid the expense of replacing it during their &#34;free scheduled maintenance&#34; period. Strangely, that recommendation only happened after they started paying for that maintenance. You really do need to replace manual, and automatic, transmission oil every 30,000 miles if you want it to last a while. This is the oil to use for virtually all manual transmissions that don't take ATF. 
Great tools to have.Not professional quality but if care is taken in its use and not abused. Should last a life time.No issue . Valterra is known for quality RV products and accessories, this is no exception. Shipping was on time and product was exactly what I was expecting. AWESOME PRODUCTS.....~!!!! 
Pros:Generous supply in 32 oz bottleWorks in fuel or mixed with engine oilSmells pleasant (minty, clean)Keeps cold engine start-ups slick and quickCons:Thin lubricantThins out your oilIt is a solvent, it MIGHT (no facts to support that possibility yet) deteriorateyour gaskets, seals.Claims:Cleans out engine, plugs, valves, and injectorsMY recommended use:8 - 10 oz per oil change(they recommend 20% mmo with engine oil change. That's about a quart)4 - 6 oz per 12 gallon fuel tankAt first use, keep engine idle for 30 mins for complete mixup and soak in.Then you drive for 1 hour, then you can switch engine off.

This is a very nice charger for many batteries, BUT it states AGM (not good for many). An AGM 12VDC VMAX, or Optima type RV or marine battery requires a special charger that will deliver 25-35 Amps, not 8. This is for a very small AGM battery. This cost over $120 and I will use it for regular flooded lead batteries but must buy another for AGM or Gel batteries for my RV. A specialty battery requires a specialty charger, I found out. I do recommend this, would buy again, and I hope this helps. 
Made in China poor quality item that does not befit the Robert Bosch brand at all.Not for winter for sure.The origin of the product should be stated at the product page.If I knew it were a MADE-IN-CHINA I would not have bought it. Considering this is made in China, it is a quality product, too bad all my locks are keyed to the some number These are well made, inexpensive, and work great. They are quality made in USA!And they had no shipping charges if added onto an existing Amazon order. 
These seem well made and are as advertised.  Heavy yes but the construction seems worth the weight.  Look at the mfg weight rating.  While these seem strong enough for automotive work I would be leery for weight limits over recommendation.  I concur with all of the positive reviews. awesome product, super comfy handles and will hold almost any weight.  I've had 250lb friends support their weight on these, so they will suffice for almost any application. Very sturdy, bright color, well made. This is what you need in a chock although I cannot find a weight rating. 
I bought this to power cordless battery chargers and small bathroom appliances for camping.  One problem.  The manual clearly states it should not be used for any of those purposes.  Testing it with a DeWalt battery and charger confirmed this.  The DeWalt charger indicated a power failure and would not charge.From the manual."Certain chargers for small nickel-cadmium or nickel-metal-hydride batteries can be damaged if powered by this inverter. Two types of appliances are susceptible to damage: Small, battery-operated appliances such as flashlights, cordless razors and toothbrushes that plug directly into an AC receptacle.* DO NOT use this inverter with the above two types of equipment.""Some inexpensive audio systems may produce a slight "buzzing" sound when operated with the inverter. The only solution to this problem is to use a sound system with better power supply filtering.""In no event will PowerBrightTM be responsible for any amount of damages beyond the amount paid for the product at retail."Online descriptions, including the manufacturer home page, give no indication of the above important information.If you are looking for an inverter for the above purposes you will want to look into a PURE sine wave inverter.  Make sure you also review the power requirements on your device before you buy the inverter as well.  Underpowered inverters can be harmful to your devices. I wanted to get this because I seem to be the only "car guy" in the household and amongst extended family (some 20+ people all in Dallas).I do all of my own car work, and could easily do simple battery voltage checks with a multimeter, but a device like this is important, because it measures amps correctly (and simply), something you don't want to do with most multimeters without calculating the proper size resistor to use inline or risk frying your multimeter.  Basically, this is a device designed to measure automotive voltage, plus check cold cranking amps, cranking amps, and load testing.The 3 stars is mainly for the usability.  First, the display (the most important thing!) is hard to read because it uses large LED bars to write out the words.  Let me explain - the first test is the battery test.  When you select the battery test, it reads "baFF" rather than "batt" only because the manufacturer chose to use a very simplistic display that doesn't have enough "bars" to create easy to read words.  It's like trying to make words with a calculator if that makes any sense.  (I will try to upload a picture later)Next, of all devices that truly need a carrying case, this one does, if only to hold the instruction manual.  It is not intuitive to use without the manual (primarily because the words are very hard to decipher or read).  There's a "glossary" on the back, but it doesn't include everything, nor the steps for each of the tests, if it DID, I would've added 1 more star.Then, on top of that, the manual somewhat confuses you a little in determining what type of battery you have.  For example, for battery types you must choose from the following:SLI - Starting/Lighting/Ignition Flooded batteryFLAT - Traditionally shaped AGM batteriesSPL - AGM-designated spiral wound batteriesGEL - Gel cell batteriesNow of the 4, what type of battery do you have???  I checked 3 cars and none have any of this written on the battery themselves.  I can only assume SLI makes the most sense.  Ideally, this would be explained a little better or use "Conventional, Marine/Deep-Cycle, Maintenance Free" wording instead.Overall, I feel 3 stars is fair for the usability - the item still works and seems to validate known good and known bad batteries and charging systems, but don't lose the instruction manual and good luck being able to read the too-simplistic screen. While this is a high tech charger it has a few things that annoy. First it shuts down in a brief power outage and you must restart it. This applies to when you plug it in. You have to set it to the proper setting. Since it has two settings, one for small batteries and one for automobiles I don't see how the manufacturer could avoid this, so while annoying, it is necessary. Second, is the connectors. They are not the standard type trickle charger connectors so you have to purchase and adapter if you have other vehicles already hardwired. I bought one here for $12. I feel this should have been included with the charger. Other than that it has worked as advertised for the past 3 months and I do recommend it for it's advanced battery maintenance. 
Pros: battery driven; flashing or steady light; flameless flare; can be used as a map light; reusable. Could be used effectively as a light that does not seriously degrade night vision.Cons: Product claims to be visible at 1000 ft, but this is only possible within a few degrees of view. One half of the top lights up for a dim presentation, but the bright LED shines out through a narrow beam like a small red flashlight. Consequently, the flare would probably not be useful in a traffic situation since it would have to be precisely aligned with oncoming traffic and would only be visible by the few drivers within this narrow beam of light. It is certainly not a good substitute for a real flare which is much brighter and omnidirectional. This little light is not as good as the emergency flashers built into vehicles.If you want a safety flare to carry in your vehicle, buy the real thing. If you want a light you can use as a map light without distracting a driver, or to see where you're walking without seriously degrading your night vision, this red light will do that well. Fits well in my my cars 12 adapter. Display section swivels 180 degrees for convenient viewing.Large easy to read numbers and backlit LCD display.3 LED Warning lights have 2 modes:one mode for battery (motor off) andone mode for alternator (motoring running). Very useful since you don't need to know the actual voltages for a healthy battery or charging system.ACCURATE. I checked the voltage reading with a professional calibrated voltmeter and it was within 0.01 volts. (Surprised me it was that accurate)Note: the LCD backlight and 1 led is always on and are bright. This may distracting to some people driving at night.Very happy with this unit. I would buy it again and recommend it to a friend. The Wolo Model BA-97 Heavy Duty Commercial Grade Back-Up Alarm is perfect for the rear of any RV of size.  It&#8217;s small ( about 3 wide x 3&#8221; tall and 2&#8221; deep) and loud enough to alert anyone you are backing.  The sound is exactly like what you hear on garbage trucks and many commercial vehicles.Wiring the unit is simple and one of the mounting bolt/screw holes automatically grounds the horn to the vehicle chassis. I used the backup light wiring in the truck to trailer cable that was not used by my trailer to get the 12 Volt positive voltage to the trailer.  I then connected to the trailer wiring block using a14 gauge &#8220;hot&#8221; lead to take the voltage to the backup alarm mounted on the read of the trailer.  Whenever I have the trailer attached to the truck and then shift the truck into reverse Bingo.  The alarm begins beeping.  Of course anytime the truck backup lights are activated, like using the key fob to shut off the truck burglar alarm, the backup horn activates for about 30 seconds. 
you pay for the name. I bought it just because everybody said to buy, for being the best. I don't think so I qualify 5 stars because it would be unfair to give a bad reputation, I purchased this product on September 27, I Bought 2 Armor extreme shine, I live in South America so I need an address where my purchases must arrived in the united States and then send to my country. My courier company said that they couldn&#8217;t transport Aerosol or contents under pressure because is a dangerous goods. I had to declare the product as abandoned, I lost my purchase. I will not be able to watch my shiny wheels, I'm sad about that, but I'm sure it's an excellent product because I have purchased other products of &#8220;Armor all&#8221; that are not dangerous goods and arrived without problems to my country where I check the good quality of their products. I won't recommend this product. I have a compressor for my car (12V) and I bought this. It dosen't work 
There are no better battery charger/maintainers than Battery Tenders and these wires are essential if you have multiple motorcycles like I do. Just attach it to the battery terminals and plug it into your Battery Tender when you need to. I ordered 2 different chargers to maintain my gate opener's deep cycle battery (a simple 4 output charger with extension cords for charging other deep cycle batteries from amazonBattery Tender 022-0148-DL-WH 12V 4-Bank Battery Management System) and this unit has a far superior charging design.The 4 bank battery tender does a simple fast rate charge then switches to a trickle charge at a constant voltage with 4 outputs.This unit pulses the battery under charge and features 3 operating modes with different current outputs for different sized batteries. The selections are motorcycle which also works well for SLA gel cells or AGM batteries, standard automotive starting battery, deep cycle batttery, and off.What makes the CTEK unit special is that it uses a pulse charge in all modes to attempt to desulphate batteries, while the battery tender does not.  This method of charging has proven successful in restoring lead acid batteries that won't take a charge any more.It comes with a waterproof 12V output cable and a set of clips or rings for permanent installation under the hood of your car.  In addition to the LEDs for indicating the type of battery being charged, a second set is provided for empty, 1/2 full, and maintenance pulse charge mode.There is also a noticable increase in quality between the battery tender and this unit - small details like a water sealed housing and gaskets on the connectors indicate quality in manufacture.For a single 12V lead chemistry battery this is a useful, well made tool. The Battery Tender Junior 12V Charger comes complete with everything needed to charge your 12V battery.  I purchased this model to specifically charge my motorcycle battery and I am pleased to say that the unit works great.  It is a very compact charger and is supplied with several attachments to ensure that your battery is kept in an optimum condition.I made the permanent hard wire attachment to my battery using the color coded leads connected directly to the appropriate positive & negative terminals on the battery. The opposite female end has an end cap which can cover the inlet when not in use. When I know that I will not be hitting the road for an extended period of time, I simply plug the unit in to maintain my existing battery's power supply.Battery Tender makes larger charging units, but this battery charger is great for charging everything from batteries for ATV's and motorcycles to scooters and lawn mowers. Because of it's very discreet size it does not take up any needed space. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to protect their battery investment and do not want to compromise space and versatility. 
I probably should compare it to another to see how accurate it is, but I really like how easy it is to use and turns off and on by itself. This thing has 2 readouts and 4 scales and no instructions on how to read any of htem.  The SWR is easy enough to figure out but the others are anyones guess, came with some little wire antenna that is nowhere in the one sheet instruction that comes with it.  The signal strength meter dosn't seem to register at all.  It was cheap enough and probelly works, but your  have to find an engineer to tell you how to use it. How do you rate these?  They do exactly what they are supposed to do.  What more can I say.  It don't stink no more?!  LOL 
Ok so I figured I would write a review since these seem to be new to amazon and they had prime shipping so I went for them.Firstly these are ATO fuses.  The description doesn't say it anywhere for some odd reason however they also sell a mini fuse set which is labeled correctly and the picture shows ATO fuses.  Anyways, the fuses came in a box that is actually pretty nice and latches properly shut.  Label says 1 year warranty although their fuses so shouldn't have a problem.  On the other side of the boxes label is a chart showing Tan = 5amp, Red = 10amp, Blue = 15amp, Yellow = 20amp, Clear = 25amp, Green = 30amp.The fuses themselves seem to be very nice quality and have the number on them printed clearly however it is the plastic color and not painted white.  Note that the link that connects the two ends is horse shoe shaped rather than zigzagged which is something I personally have never seen before.At ~$10 it was a great price for 120 fuses + an actual working container. I purchased these tail light guards and put them on my Jeep almost immediately.  They offer a good, rugged look at a low price and they'll help protect my housings on the trail.At first, it is not obvious, but the pieces are actually different in geometry and need to be installed on their proper side, so take notice of that.  The pieces are sturdy, but they do look stamped.  the cross bars are not full tubes, they are more semi-circular members.  I was not expecting that, but nevertheless, in my opinion, they helped make my jeep a little meaner at a real fair price, so I'd recommend them. put them on a 2011 jeep wrangler .These look great and go on with ease. If your are looking for taillight guards these are the ones to get. Btw the screws are the same length but a different diameter so follow instructions. 
Very quick and easy mounting and really adds to the look of the rear of the Jeep.  These are metal and not a cheap plastic and mount with included screws into the existing lens cover screw holes. I should have gotten the Honda cap.  This fits OK, but the screws are not "captured" in the cap.  With the original cap,the screws cannot fall out.  Considering the position of the screws when mounting this, captured screws are an advantage. It bothers me when front license plate is screwed directly to the bumper.  Considering the cost of these mounting brackets, I wish manufacturers included them as standard equipment; it would show their attention to detail.When I found Cruiser Accessories 79150 Mounting Plate it seemed like a good value.  I especially liked multiple slots for mounting onto the bumper.  These slots provide a good number of mounting and adjustment options.  I used the upper two vertical slots because they were spaced exactly like the existing holes in my car's front bumper.Unfortunately, there was a couple of frustrating issues that spoiled the experience:1.  Four screws that are included with the plate are too long.  I saw them being long and I am glad I checked for this before installing the mounting plate onto the front bumper.  I used included four screws to attach the license plate and the Black Cruiser Accessories 20050 Classic Lite frame to the mounting plate - screws' sharp tips protruded 1/4" from the back of the mounting plate.  If I had installed the mounting plate onto the bumper first and then tried to attach the license plate with the included screws, I would have damaged the front bumper in two places (the bottom two holes ended up over an air intake slot on my car).  I expect all pieces included with the product to be carefully engineered for that product and working properly.  These screws, obviously, are of the wrong size.  The fact that I had to go to Home Depot to find properly fitting screws not only was frustrating, but also increased the overall cost.2.  The thin pieces of plastic at the top and bottom of the mounting plate are too flimsy.  When I unpacked the plate, these areas of the mounting plate were slightly deformed: bent inwards. Fortunately, the license plate covered the problem.When the mounting plate is installed, it looks nice, so I am not completely disappointed; however, I found a similar product from Bell at Autozone, and it was cheaper (though Bell's mounting plate had very long screws too). 
This is a nice steering wheel cover.  I'm not completely sure its leather but it feels nice.  I read reviews where buyers are one starring this product saying its plastic and one even said he cut a chunk out for his to see if it was leather.  I'm going to say this.  If you want something that smells like top grain Italian leather this is not the product nor the price range you need to be looking for and it definitely isn't the expectation you should have if you paid less than $20 for a product.  For that price you get what you get,  regardless of what the manufacturer may claim. Reviewers on Amazon kill me with unrealistic expectations like products that are purchased at low costs like this one should be perfect and expensive grain leather is unrealistic and ignorant.  A nice cover it is.  Top grain leather it is not, at least not for $20. Want top quality?  Spend multiples of the cost of this product! !!! I like mine and itinstalled in a snap. It fucntions ok for being all plastic. And for the price, I wont complain. Of course made in China but OK for the price. Useful to have but don't bank on it if you exceed 5000 pounds (not 10,000 as stated). The receiver tube is of a thinner gauge hence it feels light. The hook feels solid and the inside weld is plentiful. Remember, a chain is as strong as its weakest link.I give three stars because of the price, delivery but not the Quality. OK for light duty use 
Needed to replace a broken mirror.  This one fit right onto the existing metal holder that was still cemented to the windshield.  It has a lock-screw to hold it in place.  If you need to replace the metal holder, it is included but no glue is supplied.  Overall, it is a perfectly fine basic mirror. Bought them with the cruiser plates and while they did fit the plates they did not fit the wholes on the car. Dont know why. Work fine on the front but not the rear. Also they are security screws, so do not lose the device that comes with them. FYI This is like the icing on the cake for finishing the plates.  I see a lot of nice cars with ugly dealer plate frames and rusted bolts....why why why??  Just remove the frame, get these caps and hide the ugly screws.  :)Make sure your screw heads are not the hex head as it will not fit inside the caps.  Smaller phillips head machine and tapping screws will fit no problem.

Put on 2009 Street Bob.  Stickers came off fine.  Fits at the A section of the front frame, little hole there.  Find a bolt, done.  (Well, that and plug it in). I have two cars, both of which require the large #14 sheet metal self-tapping screws to mount the plate to the nylon retainers behind the plate (the ones mounted on the car that the screws screw into). Problem is that diameter of the plastic ring that holds the screw covers is too small to take the screw's large diameter head. The maximum screw head diameter that will fit the ring is .435 inch (11 millimeters). Option 1: Replace the nylon retainers on the car, but different cars have different retainers so one must search for new ones that will accept a #12 screw. Option 2: Try to find #14 self-tapping screws with smaller heads. I shopped around for #14 screws with smaller heads to no avail. Option 3: Grind down the screw head's diameter. Option 4 (not good): On one car I used #12 sheet metal screws that have a smaller diameter, but DO fit the rings, and wrapped the threads with tape. This sort of works, but I really can't tighten them down satisfactorily. So I have to check their security now and then. I'm leaving the other car as is for now. Maybe someone has more practical ideas? Sure would like to hear of them. BTW, SEE THE UPDATE BELOW.UPDATE 11/16/13:I think I've found a viable solution to the above problem. I used a #12 sheet metal self-tapping screw, placed a 1/2-inch long piece of ordinary shrink tubing (1/4" i.d.) over the threads towards the pointed end of the screw. Used a heat gun (or you can use a match, BIC lighter or soldering iron) to shrink the tubing which effectively increases the thread diameter to about that of a #14 screw. This allows me to tighten the screw securely and will last much longer than ordinary tape. One more thing: The THICKNESS of the screw head doesn't quite allow the chrome cap to fully snap into place over the nylon ring. The top of the head needs to be filed down a little leaving enough Philips "X" to use the screwdriver. Very quick and easy mounting and really adds to the look of the rear of the Jeep.  These are metal and not a cheap plastic and mount with included screws into the existing lens cover screw holes. 
Looks and fits the same for a 2000 Toyota Sienna van. I ordered extra so I will not be without any at a later date. They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. I wish there was a guide somewhere that shows you what cars these sunshades fit. I bought this one (Super Jumbo) for my Toyota Camry, hoping it would fit. Well, it did not fit. I had to return it, and order the regular Jumbo sunshade. The regular Jumbo sunshade fits the windshield like a glove. Quality is good, and it folds up to about 14&#34;. So, if you have a 2007-2013 Toyota Camry, DO NOT BUY THIS ONE!!! Order the regular Jumbo size.Amazon, can you please look into getting some sort of reference guide that will show customers the correct vehicle application? This would make buying this product a whole lot easier.CPS 
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. I put these in my '03 TJ Jeep Wrangler.  They fit perfect and work exactly as you'd expect they should.  I installed a set of 55w HIDs in them and the light output is tremendous. 
Fit perfectly on my 2012 Honda Civic Si. Way better than spending the premium for Honda to do it, takes like 1 minute. bought this for my 2004 honda crv.  fit perfectly and cleared the code.  easy to do just give the threads some wd40 Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars 
These are fairly solid lead cables. The cables themselves are are separate so they are an actual set or pair, where others i have worked with were still connected along the length of the main lead, each lead cable is about the thickness of a cheap USB cable.The banana clips are normal/common, the metal end is completely attached to the plastic part, i have had some where they come apart of pulled to hard, these are solid. Additionally the connection into the lead wire is very solid and non removable, i think it will hold up very well and not break lose.The alligator clip ends seem to be just fine. contrary to others results i have 2 pairs and the alligator ends are just fine, teeth all line up fine. the rubber insulator is actually fairly tight which is nice because it makes the clip easier to open and close. clips that have loose movable rubber insulator can actually be clumsy to open cause the rubber slips and slides under yours fingersOverall:Really wish they were combined leads not 2 separate wires and thicker gaugeGood cables, and i would still recommend them** If this review helped you please click the button below ** Advertised for RV refrigerators, but works great in all my suitably sized RV cabinets to keep stuff put during travel.Adjustable for length (16 to 28 inches) by just twisting the end (1 turn lengthens or shortens bar by about 1/4 inch).Once adjusted to slightly longer than needed length, they have a stout internal spring that keeps them in place (spring action is about 1/4 inch).End-caps are medium hard plastic and very durable. In cases where I have extremely slippery walls, I have purchased cheap soft rubber end caps from the local hardware store to but on the bar ends. The soft caps don't hold up as well as the stock ones, but definitely stay put better on slipper wall surfaces. Purchase these bars and a few inexpensive soft end-caps and you can handle all situations.Bars are lightweight but fairly durable in use. I have yet to have one fail.Recommended Made out of metal, these are lightweight yet plenty strong, I even used one to replace a broken plastic towel rack bar and it worked perfect. I would recommend these for the broad size range, small yet strong metal construction, and no mar rubber end caps, a great deal! 
I've been using these hose nozzles for years, you won't find a better nozzle anywhere. Don't hesitate, buy a few you will love them. These aren't the best pumps in the world, but they're great for my purposes, and cheap. I use these for gear oil, when I change the oil in my rear differential. You don't want anything you used for that oil change sticking around, so I grab these cheap pumps, and throw them away immediately after. Used this for my 325Ci and I didnt once hesitate being under the car. They are made just as good as the best brands.

Just remove the frame, get these caps and hide the ugly screws.  :)Make sure your screw heads are not the hex head as it will not fit inside the caps.  Smaller phillips head machine and tapping screws will fit no problem. These Cruiser Accessories 81330 Locking Fasteners, Import-Stainless are exactly what I needed to mount my plate securely to my truck.  Though I ordered them for my car, it had no plate mount to use them on and I couldn't get up behind the plastic bumper to back up the screws with the locking nuts.  Nuts! I should have gotten the Honda cap.  This fits OK, but the screws are not "captured" in the cap.  With the original cap,the screws cannot fall out.  Considering the position of the screws when mounting this, captured screws are an advantage. 
Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. Great Fit 
put them on a 2011 jeep wrangler .These look great and go on with ease. If your are looking for taillight guards these are the ones to get. Btw the screws are the same length but a different diameter so follow instructions. Need 2 for each side, works well for small pop up. Buy these over ones w/ rope and add your own rope, same choke. These already have the hole for rope. Dimensions given are inaccurate on these two, they are exactly the same size. The Tender Jr. does not come with a cigarette adapter so I cut this in half to make two. I purchased 2 lighter plugs for a buck each from China&#8230; with free shipping&#8230; and they are working fine. These aren&#8217;t an exact match with the Tender cables but they fit together OK and are easy to determine polarity with the wire colors. You can also just use this as an extension cord for your Tender. The description states a length of 12-inches&#8230; but it&#8217;s actually 14-inches tip-to-tip on the connectors. Nice item for the price and it&#8217;s made in Mexico.

FYI Amazon page shows this will fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, and I double checked that with the Anco web site.However, this blade will NOT fit a 2002 Toyota Highlander, nor would it fit other Toyota's with the rear blade that has a "wider than normal" base where the blade attaches to the shaft.I wrote 3 times to Anco and parent company asking them to explain why their listing is incorrect - they never responded back.I later purcahsed the Trico 12-A - it DID fit my 02 highlander

In these cases, when all you need is a cheap plastic funnel it all comes down to price. There are no frills here... you pour things through this into other things... end of story.If that's what you're trying to do, I highly recommend this one These blades are very quiet with no chatter. I mean it is almost eerie when you see them move and realize that noise is missing. They also pickup all the little tiny drops like the Bosch micro edge blades do. I will be buying these again! These are  nice wipers. The design makes them less susceptible to icing/snow than the older style blades but they do not clear the windshield any better. I have had them for about 6 months and they are skipping and leaving dry spots just like those blades with "pressure points" so the claim that "even pressure technology" doesn't seem to be any kind of great improvement. They will probably do better if you clean them and reset the way they lay on the windshield every so often. They are always bent in the same direction after use and I guess they get a memory/set to them.

How do you rate these?  They do exactly what they are supposed to do.  What more can I say.  It don't stink no more?!  LOL Well this thing is as easy as tying your shoes laces. Plug in two wires, let it sit there for a few seconds and BOOM, it works. I still have to wait to fill up so I can calibrate that portion but everything else is good to go. This thing tells you everything you want to know about your vehicle components and more. The X-gauge is an awesome addition to an already great product. You can go the their website and review how to program the X-guages that are compatible with your specific vehicle. Don't wait like I did. Order this NOW!!! As usual Amazon came through with the shipping. If you don't want take my word for it, just look at the 300+ people that purchased it before me. Now I know exactly what my actual and average gas mileage is for my truck. These little things are really cool, so I would recommend them if you don't mind drilling out your plate mounts. I just wonder what kind of idiot would use larger screws in their product than the US standard. 
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Inexpensive, yet works as good as the ones sold by Honda dealerships. Made true to specs and fits right into the slot on my Accord 2006.Will buy again. I ordered this for replacement from oem gas cap and it fit very good on my Honda with great success

Fits great for both my front bumper receiver and rear receiver on my 2005 Dodge Ram.  No complaints, and I'd definitely buy it again. 
I probably should compare it to another to see how accurate it is, but I really like how easy it is to use and turns off and on by itself. I didn't know (probably didn't read the details again) that this required assembly. But it was really simple and straightforward. I understood once I got it that the simple assembly (4 screws) is how it is made to fit any RV stove. Really adds to the counter space when we aren't cooking. This filter drops right in and has carbon in the filter for filtration.  I looked up how to replace this filter online however the directions included show exactly how to replace it since it is behind the glove box.  It will only take about ten minutes.  Don't let the dealer charge you $35 for this job! 
The size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous. The funnel is 10" long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6" long. It states that the funnel is 4" x 4" but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2-1/4" in diameter at the widest point.It would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless. We received these and they work very well. Make sure that you measure the distance between the wheels and the size of the wheel because there are two different sizes. They work much better than wheel chocks. would recommend getting a  size  smaller than  what the  &#34;sizing chart&#34; recommends  as  I  measure aroun my leg  as  recommended  and  the chaps  were  one size too large.. otherwise they are  awesome  quality and build 
would recommend getting a  size  smaller than  what the  &#34;sizing chart&#34; recommends  as  I  measure aroun my leg  as  recommended  and  the chaps  were  one size too large.. otherwise they are  awesome  quality and build Sizes listed in reviews and the two in the description (15.8 x 10.5 x 5, and 12.5 x 9.5 x 7) don't match to what I received...The bag I received is in between what has been listed in the descriptions:  13.5" x 9" x 6" (empty).While seemingly a good quality bag, with a fair amount of straps and attached rain-cover (hidden in the heel of the bag), it seems the manufacturer (or seller) has no idea how to use a measuring tape!The bag itself is quite nice... good padding, rubberized bottom to prevent sliding, small pockets on either side, and zippers seem of reasonable quality.For the price and bag quality, I'm not complaining.  It works great on my CB750, and it does fit on the pillion of my VT1100c2 (without having to remove my rider backrest)  So if you have standard seating (or a touring/adventure style), this bag will do well for you as a pillion bag, and with a little strap adjustments, it also fits vertical on the front or back of a sissy-bar, or horizontal on a larger luggage rack... Need 2 for each side, works well for small pop up. Buy these over ones w/ rope and add your own rope, same choke. These already have the hole for rope. Dimensions given are inaccurate on these two, they are exactly the same size. 
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. good bungies, nice compact cover can litteraly fit in from fork pouch, thin but protective and fit a Dyna Glide without windshield very well Exactly what was offered, fit nicely, no major prep work, won't fade or crack, adjusts perfectly, easy removal and fits under seat in truck 
Works great.  Gaskets... Small leaks... Temp fixes or permanent.  The uses are endless.  It's a liquid rubber that dries into an oil resistant gasket.  What's not to like ?  If you lose the cap, you can even make another one out of the substance. These are light duty jumpers but will work for occasional use. There are times when the voltmeter needs to be connected and you cannot hold the leads. These are fine for that. Screws are very soft and are easy to strip and not stainless.Plate is flimsy so think thoroughly about how to secure it best 
I don't need a gallon of this stuff.  I don't need a quart.  I don't even need a pint... so this was the perfect size to have on hand for occaional small engine reassembly and repair. If you don't have a REAL cruise control on your bike, you need one of these.  I wouldn't ride without it.  They sell different shaped ones, too.  I just ground mine down to fit my hand better.  Adjusts easily while riding. Rain-X makes terrible wipers, but you don't need them if you put enough of this on.Tip: don't put it on the side windows, unless you want all the rainwater rushing up into your car whenever you crack them open. 
Clipped onto the doorlock and door latch rods securely and installed onto the inner door release handle nice and firm.  Worked perfectly. Needed to replace a broken mirror.  This one fit right onto the existing metal holder that was still cemented to the windshield.  It has a lock-screw to hold it in place.  If you need to replace the metal holder, it is included but no glue is supplied.  Overall, it is a perfectly fine basic mirror. The hitch pin locks are wonderful.  High quality, durable, and weather proof.  But if I had to do it over, I might just buy the pin locks (Master Lock Key Alike Set with Receiver and Coupler Latch Locks, 2-Piece Set #2848DAT) without the coupler lock.  First of all, the coupler lock doesn't really deter someone from stealing your RV trailer if they are determined.  You can simply connect the chains to a vehicle and drive off or just cut the coupler lock off.  I use the claw for real security (Tire Claw XL Lock #491KA - ATV, Auto, Trailer Locks).  Therefore, the only thing the coupler lock does is deter the casual thief if you don't use the claw.  The ball is grey plastic with a steel inner, which should work well.  I find that when it's in place, it hangs down and looks kind of floppy.  I may just end up using the hitch pin locks and claw only and forget the coupler lock. 
Any tech should have one of this when recommending replacement of a customers tire. Some states require you have this for state inspection. This product is a MUST have for anyone who does any type of electrical work (automotive, motorcycle, marine, etc) as it stops any corrosion from starting up or protecting a cleaned up connector... A good buy.  Does the same job that the Honda OEM part does. 
I realize that there are testimonials for this product actually doing what it says it will do.  I have not had an occasion to need it in an emergency.  AND - I hope that I never do.  It does not inspire confidence.  It feels like something that would be included in a child's toy tool set.  Extremely lightweight.  Directions state you must hit the window in a specific location - good luck with that in an emergency.  I was hoping for a tool with enough weight, which added to acceleration, would break the window.  Again, I have not used it, and I will not trust it in an emergency - so I will be looking for a better product.  I do not recommend this item...at any cost. these seem to be very good quality spreaders. I am going to buy another set to have on hand  in case i need them. I haven't used them yet but they look good and it will do what I need. I need to wash my car I guess 
Alright, I will admit I got this, just in case!I keep reading about frozen oxygen sensors, but haven't run across one yet. Guess the ones I've replaced have been too, out in the open, to be frozen and impossible to get to!I know I will never be able to find one of these gadgets when I do have a problem, so, what the heck, right?I'm keeping my fingers crossed I'll never need it! Perfect for extending the cable on anything that plugs into your cars OBDII port. I'm using it for my power programmer since I can see the readouts while I'm driving. At the end of the day if you're not using this for audio or video all that matters in the price.. and this is great in that category! Haven't used it yet because I'm still looking for the interface to hook on my buffer wheel...I bought something for that and I'm still back to &#34;square zero&#34;...you would think that in the marketing of this sort of product the seller would fill in the gaps on the other things you need to hook everything up. Not sure I can use it without buying a totally new buffer (which I really don't want to do, since I just bought one). If you already have a hook and loop wheel on your buffer, this product may be just fine. 
Works great, nice to have a second cable, but the OBD end of the cable is angled.  In my case, this cable won't work on my Subaru Outback.  I would prefer the option of a straight OBD connector.  Note that the angle connector works on my other four cars (Mazda, Honda, Dodge). This makes it SO easy to charge in conjunction with my battery tender.  So far it has fit all my vehicles batteries ( Acura integra, Toyota Tundra, Toyota Pickup ) Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. 
I ordered this for a 2002 mercedes e320. This unit has to be connected to the swi-can to allow the steering wheel functions to work with an aftermarket head unit. The swi-can connects to the can harness and the swi-jack connects to the radio. It was fairly easy to install and the controls of my alpine head unit work from the wheel. I was told by crutchfield that there was no way to utilize the steering wheel controls on the e320 with the alpine radio. I am glad I found out about the swi-can and the swi-jack.The swi-jack was somewhat difficult to program at first. The thing to keep in mind is that the unit has preset functions so you have to either use each one with a button on the wheel, or skip it as the instructions say. There are some YouTube videos showing how to program it, that are helpful. The installation of the SG2 is simple: attach the OBD2 connector to the DLC port and attach the RJ-45 jack to the SG2 unit. Routing the cable is really up to the operator. I chose to do it in a crude manner because I don't plan to make it a permanent addition to the car. I zip tied the cable to my HVAC vents and anchored it to the empty traction control hole behind the glove box.I used 1 of the provided velcro kits to affix the SG2 to the top of my steering column so that it is right below the instrument panel. It actually blocks my view of the shift indicator array, although I can still see it clearly if I lean forward.The update rate set at FAST is still rather slow and that is to be expected with the outdated OBD-II network. The "fastest" aftermarket scan tool that I have seen is SCT's Live Link for Ford / GM / Chryslers. If you want anything faster, you are going to have to borrow an OEM's scan tool system.The X-Gauge interface is a bit cumbersome since you are restricted to using 2 buttons to enter alphanumeric characters while if you pause for anything more than 10-15 seconds, the SG2 shuts down. According to Linear Logic, they are working on an updated SG2 with datalogging features so hopefully they incorporate a PC interface to speed up programming and setup times.I have it set to monitor instantaneous MPG, RPM, Vehicle Speed, and a gauge that I frequently switch depending on my mood. I am monitoring the torque converter slip ratio. Whenever it reads below 1.00, it means the torque converter is "slipping". Above 1.00 means the output side of the converter is spinning faster than the input side and theoretically it could just mean engine braking with some torque converter slip. You can program custom X-Gauges to monitor gross engine horsepower or torque input at the transmission.I had previously used a Garmin Forerunner 101 to check my GPS vehicle speed and compared it to my speedometer readout (2000 Ford Crown Vic with mechanical speedometer). It revealed that my GPS speed was about 2-3 mph slower than the speedometer indicated speed. The SG2's vehicle speed readout (from the Vehicle Speed Sensor PID in the OBD-2 system) is approximately 2-3 mph slower than the speedometer reading and I am assuming this is the same readout as my GPS (I didn't get a chance to verify this yet).Some of the gauges I like to monitor are Coolant Temperature, Intake Air Temperature, Transmission Fluid Temperature (XGauge), Torque Converter Slip Ratio (XGauge), Gross Horsepower (XGauge), RPM, Vehicle Speed, and MPG.I still haven't been able to figure out how to work the trip computer properly to display averaged fuel economy. The instantaneous MPG is more important to me because I want to see if anything is not working right on long cruises. I have often wondered if the torque converter was locking properly when I use cruise control or when cruising on the highway.The data collection stability is impressive. I never ran into many problems with Car Code or SCT's Live Link, but SG2 is just more convenient and compact. The backlight colors are interesting as they allow you to choose 4 different values of each RGB component (or 64 possible combinations). I have it set to R=3, B=0, G=0 so that it resembles Pontiac's interior lighting (I drive a Ford).My only real complaint is that there's not a better way of attaching the SG2 to the car. A suction cup mount for the windshield would come in handy since I could mount it near my line of sight without relying on adhesive-backed velcro. The interface is quite intuitive but I would have liked a way to program the X-gauge more easily, like via a PC interface.Bottom line: The SG2 is a great deal if you are interested in data readouts for your car. There are cheaper ways of pulling DTC codes, so the only real usefulness of SG2 is the "realtime" PID monitoring and the trip computer for cars that do not have such devices. If you know someone who is a bona fide gearhead and drives a car made in 1996 or newer, they may appreciate the SG2 as a gift.UPDATE:While the ScanGauge II provided a useful feature for cars without trip computers or onboard monitoring for various PIDs, I have noticed that it began to malfunction more frequently. The gauge readouts began to "flicker" between PIDs. For example, monitoring IGNition, the IGN began to switch rapidly between HPR. Just recently, the entire ScanGauge II shutdown while I was driving. It would refuse to reconnect with the OBD2 network. When it did find a connection, a lot of the text was garbled and it lost all of my trip data except for the total mileage. My car normally maxes out on 300 miles per tank of gasoline, so I was bewildered when the SG2 said I drove over 4000 miles. Other SG2 readers have reported similar quirks, albeit not as serious as the self shutdown and data corruption that I experienced.Many newer cars already have features built-into the car. The Pontiac G8, and Nissan GT-R are two examples of cars that have very developed "trip computers" while many other modern vehicles like the Pontiac G6, have trip computers that can monitor most of the fuel-related data. I installed this brake controller in a 1955 GMC pickup truck that I use for towing. Just follow the diagram for wiring and it just works like a breeze. I like the way you can adjust easily the voltage with the dial on the left and the mounts provided allows you to install it a convenient location under the dash (it works in any position).If you want to install this in a more modern truck without tapping directly into the wires, you will need additional adapters at extra cost. 
I added this to my double receiver so as to use my bike rack and cargo hauler at the same time. Without this accessory my cargo hauler was too close to the bikes. This provide the added distance for clearance, Have not used it yet but nice to have when needed. Thought this would help winterize if no RV antifreeze available. very easy to use and provide great protection and shine. I see no reason to use separate polish as I did a comparison and this alone provides same level of shine as using Meguairs #7 polish. Plus this is a wax and provides protection. 
IT WORKS Works as advertised. does the job. 
At least my car was in the driveway when it decided not to start so it wasnt too bad. I am now searching on amazon for one with higher than 400 power.It would not start my six cylinder engine on my crossfire. I think it will be ok in the other vehicles that have four cylinders. No way this would ever start a V8. It was fully charged just not enough oomph. The K&K; models look interesting but I am not excited about having to tend them while they are charged to prevent damage. Unit does work well for powering less taxing things though and the pump works well, just wont start your car if you have a six cylinder or up.In the end just used them for mobile compressor to air up tires until they all diedHope this helps. We have a 2006 MDX which is rarely driven....its a family car.  That fact alone means that the battery wont have enough juice to start the car when we need it.  The TENDER not only charged this battery, but kept it under control so that the car started perfect when we needed it.  This is a must have product for your garage. Works perfectly with my 3rd generation (2008) Hyundai Accent. Plugs in and within 5 seconds it had the codes ready. The Equus 3030 has I/M Readiness Monitors which are AWESOME. It'll let you know precisely if you'll pass your emissions inspection (unless your area has visually inspected emissions, which it obviously can't tell you). Worth every penny. :D 
Bought this to install with an aftermarket Kenwood Navigation 7120 on my 08 Toyota Tacoma.  It took several hours to install, but it works great with the wheel controls in my Toyota. Did not fit my car's filter harness after Amazon's compatibility tool said it would, there was a 1.5&#34; gap compared to the OEM filter, I have a 2006 Honda Civic Si - steer clear of this if you own the same car I have previously used in: 1980 Honda CX500C to fix a rough idle, 2000 Suzuki SV650 to stabilize fuel, and a 2005 Chevy Cobalt to fix a problem with stalling at idle. 
I expect these to last 100k miles like the original set. Changed plugs in 2002 & 2003 Honda CRVs: $88. Shop price to replace plugs: $370 for both vehicles. Time: 20 minutes, and I worked slowly. I've used it only once to recharge my camper battery.  It took almost 12 hours, but it worked as claimed. I bought this charger to replace my old one which lasted 18 years and was used at least twice a week in our shop. The new one ways half of what the one did, so I hope it will last as long. This is a great charger, the only thing missing from it, is an automatic shut off, for when the battery is completely charged. But for 1/2 the cost of our old shop charger I Will Take It.  So far so good. 
Exact replacement from OEM. Exact fit worked perfect . Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs. IT WORKS Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.  The pickle fork is the last resort for me, as it will damage the balljoint boot.I prefer to use the Snap On balljoint remover.  If that one cannot fit, then I will try this tool.  If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork. 
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Works just like it needs to.

I maintain a car, an SUV, and two motorcycles, as well as my parents' cars and a neighbor's pickup truck. the Mityvac has proven to be a reliable, clean way to remove oil, differential lubricant, and automatic transmission fluid, as well as bleed brakes (with the bleeder kit). I now use it on the riding mower and auxiliary generator as well; there seems to be no end to possible applications. Seals, hoses, and gaskets have been no problems, even with synthetic lubricants. I presently use this in a 2007 Dodge Nitro SXT (56,000 miles) and a 2005 Yamaha Royal Star motorcycle (shaft drive, 88,000 miles) which are both frequently operated far from population centers. I've also used this in my previous Dakota pickup truck and my Mustang hardtop, total mileage on all vehicles in excess of 500,000 miles (206,000 on the Mustang, 166,000 on the Dakota) and no problems experienced with any of them. I consider it cheap "insurance" for vehicles I depend upon to get me wherever I need to be. My 09 Corvette periodically gets a total detail with wheels, tires, suspension and everything under the car. This is my go to product to remove road grime and bring back the &#34;like new&#34; condition the car. Depend on this product to take care of the really hard cleanup projects for you car. 
Fits up to bank 1, sensor 1 O2 sensor on 2004 Ford Taurus 3.0L Vulcan Flex. Very high quality socket, which is expected from Lisle. Get the thread chaser from Lisle as well to be sure of a clean thread before installing the the new O2 sensor. Both the socket and thread chaser are offered on Amazon at a very good price. Product shipped quickly. It is as described and will work fine for my vehicle. Do not order the Reese Power ball 72802 as the hitch mount is 3/4" and the draw bar is 1" mount. You'll need a bushing or return it for a larger mount. bought this to use with my k2500 4x4 suburban as the standard jack no longer works with a lift kit and bigger tires.this is a must have for a hi-lift jack. with the 60" jack it works perfectly. i originally tried it with a 48" and it just wasn't enough due to the loss of about 8" of useable lift due to the chain hanging lower. 
Nobody else has mentioned it.  This is the K&N size for anyone who uses the Ford FL1A.  It also works in place of the Derale 13092. I have previously used in: 1980 Honda CX500C to fix a rough idle, 2000 Suzuki SV650 to stabilize fuel, and a 2005 Chevy Cobalt to fix a problem with stalling at idle. I purchased this back in 1992 for my Oldsmobile and have used it on every car since: Accord, Civic, Integra, GTI, 240SX, 200SX, Maxima, Sentra and I could go on... You name it and it works. If you have a super wide filter or really tight space where the ratchet attaches, it may not be ideal. In my opinion, it's worked on 95% of the vehicles I've owned and this tool is awesome! 
Hope this helps , I bought these for my 2002 chevy suburban 1500 4X2 5.3 liter. Fits great and I'm sure the truck is loving them!! Almost 200,000 miles on this suburban, heck if a truck!! Even though Amazon says it does not fit my truck; it does fit my 2002 Chevrolet 2500HD crew cab with 6.0L gas engine. I replaced both sensors and harness. Both sensors were rough looking and the rear sensor had standing water on it. It was a little bit of a chore to get to them because you have to remove the intake but it was not too bad. I recently bought a 2011 Hyundai Tucson loaded to the gills and was astonished at how impossibly wimpy the single note factory horn was.  Leather seats, nav, panoramic sunroof, bluetooth, backup camera, kick-*ss sound system with subwoofer and iPod integration, etc., all kinds of toys.  Yet the factory horn sounds almost as robust as the horn in the 1966 VW bus my family had when I was a kid.  "Meep meep."  Note I said the Hyundai horn was ALMOST as robust as the '66 VW.  I think the VW horn had a little more oomph.  What was Hyundai thinking??I found a Hyundai tech to swap the original Hyundai/Kia P.O.S. horn with this item and the results are awesome.  My first ever new-car mod and it worked out great. 
Item works as described, saves crooks from sealing your gas. Key works smoothly in cap and with a turn its uocked Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.

... there are other tools that work just as good, if not better, for half or even less then the price of this.Plain and simple this is a great roller, the rubber head doesn't cut or tear into the foil backing of the sound deadening mat and really helps you put good even pressure to hard to reach areas. That and it saves wear and tear on your hands.But like I said there are cheaper alternatives like a super cheap wallpaper seam roller (you can find some with a rubber or wooden roller) or my personal favoritea "J" roller. With the J roller you can use the roller or even the curved handle to apply pressure to the sound deadening mat. You can even use old roller skate/blade wheels.So to recap:Great toolSaves your hands from a ton of wear and tearWorks greatBUT other tools/items can be had that do the same thing for much less. This is a bigger than stock replacement for the GenII Toyota Prius (2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009). Use with a good oil like Mobil 1 0w20 and you can push out changes for 10K to 15K miles (still regularly check via dipstick).These filters work great and are easy to install. The little grip nubs on the bottom (well top in the picture but these install upside down on the Prius) make it really easy to install without the need of special ring wrenches or silicon non-slip pads. Just grip and twist.Another upside is that the outer material itself is not shiny and smooth like other brands. A sharpie marker easily writes on and sticks without smudging. I write the date of replacement and mileage at replacement on the filter bottom and it stays there when I go to change it out. A nice little feature. These hose clamp pliers are a godsend.  It makes easy work of getting those spring type clamps off where they usually are tucked in the most inopportune places.  I do like the pliers however I would additionally recommend getting a set of bent tip needle-nose type pliers as well.  I find myself grabbing the bent (angled tip) needle-nose for the majority of my spring hose clamp work and using the cable type for ones that are just too far deep in the engine bay.These work great for undoing the lower radiator hose clamps in many cars.  I think every serious mechanic should have a set of these.  No problems with the quality.

The vinyl will break so just stretch it a little. 
How can one really rate it, as it is used for protection and no idae how long it should last, yet is was as listed so I give it the benifit ogf the doubt... Easy to use, kinda messy, voids header warranty and cools under the hood. Yes voids some warranties. Hooker headers website, use of header wrap voids warranty, guess the wrapped header gets the metal too hot and it turns brittle. That's a big FYI I've an Optima in my old Corvette that has now failed.  I've have read thru their warranty information.  It states that the battery must be returned to the selling dealer for warranty service.  It cannot be returned to Amazon for any reason.  Therefore my question is this:If the battery purchased thru amazon should require warranty service, how is this done and by whom? 
Well....It's a good ball.  It's a shiny ball.  Exactly what it's supposed to be.  Pulls a trailer.  Very tough.  Thanks. I'm obliged to switch regularly between 1-7/8" and 2" balls on my hitch, and the Reese Interlock hitch balls make the swap a one-handed operation with the Reese Towpower hitch. That may not seem significant, but in inclement weather it allows you to hold an umbrella or tarp for protection and complete the swap with your remaining hand, in comparative comfort; the first time you have to change a ball in the rain, sleet or snow will sell you on one-handed swaps. It's a great product, however, it would not fit my Honda Shadow VT750 disc brake.It supposedly has 10mm holes in the disc brake, but for some reason the pin just won't fit!Otherwise it looks like a good product!I've used the 5mm pin for my scooters; however my motorcycle now has to do without lock. 
I use it for my dual back tires in a Ford 350 chassis. It would not register the tire pressure accurately. It was hard to get a tight seal around the valve stem. I will try the CH tire inflater with the built in gauge and the chuck that hopefully will get a tight seal on the valve stem. STOP! Got this to take out the front side oxygen sensors on my 2002 Ford Crown Vic Police Interceptor P71. It does NOT fit, no way, no how! Get a 7/8" combo wrench or one of those fancy pants combo wrenches with the split socket at one end! My sensors weren't even that tight! Even though Amazon says it does not fit my truck; it does fit my 2002 Chevrolet 2500HD crew cab with 6.0L gas engine. I replaced both sensors and harness. Both sensors were rough looking and the rear sensor had standing water on it. It was a little bit of a chore to get to them because you have to remove the intake but it was not too bad. 
Tired of being charged WAY to much pretty much everywhere for a 5 min filter change? I got this for my 2008 prius and you can do the install yourself in under 5 min for almost nothing. Never pay $120 again at the dealer.Your CAF is located behind the glovebox. To get to it, you need to open your glovebox and let it sit open all the way. Empty out your glovebox. If you don't, you'll be cleaning up the contents of your glovebox from the floor when you're done replacing your CAF. Next step is to look on the right side and unhook the dampener. Next, squeeze the rear of the glovebox sides inwards to be able to let the glovebox swing all the way down.Looking inside, you'll see a tray with latches on both sides. Press those latches inwards and start sliding the tray out.When you put your new CAF into the tray, make sure you follow the arrow on the filter as the air is meant to flow through in one direction. The air flow is down. If you forget, the tray has an arrow on it also that says &#34;air flow&#34;.To finish the job, reverse the proceedures above. Slide the tray in, click into place, rotate the glovebox up and let it snap into place, replace the dampener bar, then close the glovebox. I found out by accident that on my RV, you can simply push down on the round "handle" that is on the slider, and that will open the door. So at least for my RV ( 2012 Keystone Springdale TT ) this device is not needed. You might want to try it on yours too. This was not in any manual that came with my RV, but it is clearly designed to work this way. The slider is spring loaded in the vertical dimension. Only gave it 3 stars. You will need get flat washers to put on each side of the plastic or the bolts will pull through. I used Number 8 Flat washers.  Could be built better. But for me it will work. Good Luck 
They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. IT WORKS These work on my 2012 F150. They fit perfectly with no vibration at all. An excellent product and I highly recommend them! 
Bought this for work... do a lot of Toyota, scion, lexus oil filters... works good. nice tight fit and hasent stripped anything yet... Inexpensive, yet works as good as the ones sold by Honda dealerships. Made true to specs and fits right into the slot on my Accord 2006.Will buy again. They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods.

Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.

If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork. Product shipped quickly. It is as described and will work fine for my vehicle. Do not order the Reese Power ball 72802 as the hitch mount is 3/4" and the draw bar is 1" mount. You'll need a bushing or return it for a larger mount. I'm obliged to switch regularly between 1-7/8" and 2" balls on my hitch, and the Reese Interlock hitch balls make the swap a one-handed operation with the Reese Towpower hitch. That may not seem significant, but in inclement weather it allows you to hold an umbrella or tarp for protection and complete the swap with your remaining hand, in comparative comfort; the first time you have to change a ball in the rain, sleet or snow will sell you on one-handed swaps.

They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Used this to pull the rear axles in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak.  Works great.  Would recommend. I mounted this as an auxiliary transmission cooler in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 with the 4.0.  No issues.  Obviously, this was a custom installation.  But with a little research on the jeep forums, no problem. 
I have previously used in: 1980 Honda CX500C to fix a rough idle, 2000 Suzuki SV650 to stabilize fuel, and a 2005 Chevy Cobalt to fix a problem with stalling at idle. Perfect for exhaust work.  I bought it for a catalytic converter and o2 sensor project because it is rated for: -30F to 1800F This fit all four O2 sensors on my 2002 Toyota Tundra and I could have not completed the job without this specialized socket.

Very neat tool to remove battery post without twisting or jerking cables try to pull them out from battery .This tool also can be used to remove windshield wiper arms or other small job need to slowly easy to pull out the part. Good to have in tool box, special for mechanic use to replace battery when remove cables . It fit my 2002 Ford Crown Vic Police Interceptor P71.Do this, it actually helped my car run smoother. You should have seen the jet black junk that came out of the "in" end of the filter when I dumped it out! How the filter was working, I don't know!I heard these filters are supposed to come with new hose clips, but neither of mine did on two separate orders.If you haven't done this before it can get messy with a pressurized fuel system (taking the gas cap off did little to relieve the pressure). Get a pan, rags, fire extinguisher, eye protection, and a hose to wash yourself off! It seems like the gas squirts out all over, and it does, but if you're quick enough, and wrap the hose in rags, you will have half a chance. NO OPEN FLAMES, SPARKS, HOT MUFFLERS, ETCETERA! DANGER!!! GAS, EXPLOSION, DEATH!There are clips on either end of the filter that LOOK like they come off, however, you can buy a little plastic set of "clip release" tools (Lisle 39400 Angled Disconnect Tool Set) that fit all of the clips on the car. You slide them into the hose and it spreads the clips for easy removal, and I reused mine again. Motion Pro Cable LuberThe latest version of this tool has TWO thumb screws.I purchased this tool because it was recommended as a basic tool for maintaining your motorcycle or any other vehicle/device that uses cables. Well, after talking to some experienced riders, they all exclaimed that lubricating the cable (clutch or throttle) is a good idea, but they generally have never done this in over 20-30 years. Looking at the latest motorcycles, the cables don't really allow you to lubricate them using this tool or any tool for that matter. On my Ducati, there are rubber boots that prevent you from injecting lube into the sheath assuming you can use the tool and reach the sheath. On my Ford, the throttle cable sheath isn't thick enough to form a tight seal with the Motion Pro tool. It almost seems like the OEMs don't want you to lubricate the cables. On top of it, modern cars and the latest motorcycles use drive-by-wire which is totally electronic where your throttle input (pedal or twist grip) is connected to a potentiometer that tells the computer your desired throttle angle/input, and it activates a stepper motor that opens/closes the throttle plates accordingly. So if you're interested in maintaining your new bike or car with this tool, you might want to reconsider buying the tool.If you have a vehicle that uses cables and has a sheath that is accessible and large enough to form a seal, this tool is very easy to use and well made. Just slide the cable through the slit, push the tool up against the sheath entrance, clamp down the screws, and insert your lubricant nozzle/tube into the open port. Then use rags to seal the tool and the exit of the cable sheath, and squirt away.Overall: 4/5 stars, the rubber seal could have been designed to accommodate really skinny cable sheaths. Newer bikes and cars don't need/can't use this tool.

So, I can't comment on how well it works.  The main reason for this review is to put it out there that it does not work with a 2000 Chevy Silverado.  The siphon tube does not fit thru the bottom of the dip stick tube.  It would be really nice if Mityvac had a published list of what vehicles it works with and what ones it does not.  I have my fingers crossed that it'll work with my jet ski, otherwise there will be a new/(un)used Mityvac on *****'slist.  Long story short, do your research to see if you can confirm or deny if it will work with your vehicle before you buy it. 
Even though Amazon says it does not fit my truck; it does fit my 2002 Chevrolet 2500HD crew cab with 6.0L gas engine. I replaced both sensors and harness. Both sensors were rough looking and the rear sensor had standing water on it. It was a little bit of a chore to get to them because you have to remove the intake but it was not too bad.

...fits my 1973 Chevy/GMC 4x4 steering wheel perfect. Stretch it over the wheel and wrap the vinyl string around it nice and tight. The vinyl will break so just stretch it a little. Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. STOP! Got this to take out the front side oxygen sensors on my 2002 Ford Crown Vic Police Interceptor P71. It does NOT fit, no way, no how! Get a 7/8" combo wrench or one of those fancy pants combo wrenches with the split socket at one end! My sensors weren't even that tight!

Great quality.  American made. Made in China poor quality item that does not befit the Robert Bosch brand at all.Not for winter for sure.The origin of the product should be stated at the product page.If I knew it were a MADE-IN-CHINA I would not have bought it. Considering this is made in China, it is a quality product, too bad all my locks are keyed to the some number 
This thing is pretty basic. You essentially create a girth hitch with it. You pass the strap around an object, then you take the standing part of the strap and grab a loop of it and pass it through the sewn loop at the tag end of the strap. Then you slide this thing between the standing part and the sewn loop, and when you tighten the strap, the bone prevents the standing part from sliding back through the sewn loop, essentially creating a knot. Any sailer will be familiar with this system it's used alot in quick release knots. Very tough tool.Used on a hard to get at ball joint (2000 Eldo}that cannot be accessed from the top(thread end} using a standard puller.Cannot use a fork without destroying the boot.This tool slipped in easily and broke the ball joint loose without any struggle or flexing, very solid.It also worked well for removing a tie rod end. Great quality-make and not astro-turf. Thin and easily installed. Good grip to step and shoes. It is not a long pile so will not hold a lot of dirt. I recommend a carpet or rug on the ground to wipe feet on. This goes on a Jayco Greyhawk motorhome with a power step, and uses 4 hooked-springs in grommets. Be very careful hooking this type or you can impale your fingers with a sharp spring-end, even if you use gloves. Use leather or a solid type of glove material that cannot be penetrated by the needle-sharp spring-end. There is one step-cover type that uses ties but has bad reviews as the ties can break during travel-probably unlikely but time can make ties brittle. The only con with is it could be a little longer as the lower step shows the grommets. 
As others have said the pin is a bit long for a 2" receiver but this is easily remedied. To prevent the side-to-side play just get some small O-rings from the dollar store and stack enough on the fixed end. When you slide the pin in you compress the rings slightly to put the lock on. When you let go the O-rings expand and put pressure on the pin and also keep it from rattling. Maybe you are old enough to remember the old forks you pounded into your suspension to remove ball joints.  This little gizmo saves the seal, and pops the joint out in just a few turns.  Leave the nut on so it doesn't go flying.  There is a bearing on the end of the screw on my version, so the end of the screw is not 'swirling' metal on metal. I bought a pair of these for my 2002 Grand Cherokee. It took a grand total of 5 minutes to install both of them, and half of that was spent looking for a screwdriver.If you are at all nervous about trying this, here is a overly detailed set of instructions.1. Open hood. Prop it open with something wooden so it doesn't fall on you.2. Identify the strut on the right side of the hood.3. Identify the small metal clip at both ends of the strut. If in doubt, look at the new ones. You are looking for a metal band, about 1/2 inch in width, with two small slots. On the vehicle, slide a small screwdriver blade into the clip's slots, and twist the screwdriver to pry the clip upward. You can remove it, or just loosen it enough that there is a good sized gap between the clip and the strut.4. Now pull the strut away from the hood/body. You may need to slide a screwdriver behind the strut arm to get a little bit of leverage. It is easier to start with the end attached to the hood.5. Remove both ends of the strut from the vehicle.6. Attach the new strut. Make sure the strut is aligned the same way as the old one-with the cylinder at the top of the strut. (Refer to the opposite strut). Just place the socket in the strut over the ball joint on the vehicle, and give it a little tap or squeeze with your hand. It should snap right on.7. Repeat on the other strut.Note- if it seems like the strut is too big, the hood is probably not open all the way. There is NO WAY you are strong enough to compress the strut by hand.I'd strongly recommend replacing them in pairs, otherwise you will get a twisting motion on your hood. Plus if one failed, the other one is close behind.That's it, you're done. 
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Perfect fit for rear window on my 2004 Ford Excursion Limited. Easy to install. No spotting seen or squeaking at all 
This rotor seems OK, but the original is held in place by a screw that is under a plastic dust cover.  So, how do I remove the rotor? This air deflector makes the air go to the side.  That's all it does.1. There are 2 pieces and no printed instructions - just the box where you can see how to assemble.2.  The 2 pieces fit together by grooves.  Slide and you can adjust by pulling/pushing to get it to fit on vent.3.  Magnets to hold this on vent.  The magnets aren't strong but - barely strong enough to hold on the ceiling.There's nothing good to look at with this deflector.  It kind of disappears since it's transparent plastic.If this will fit your vent, just get one.  See how you like it and you can order more later. Easy to replace. It lacks Toyota instructions, but it is exactly like existing Toyota part with all wires colored the same way so it is very obvious how to connect those.The original part has a silicone rubber tube going all the way from top to bottom with wires running inside it. This part only provides a short length of tubing that, at best, would cover half of the length of wires on my car.I thing they should provide a &#34;telescoping&#34; tubing of two diameters with one going inside of the other while you are crimping wires and then extended to cover the full length of wires 
The guage has a cheap look and feel without the cover, I agree it should come with the gauge, but since it does not the best thing to do it purchase it.  Each time you grab the gauge you will appreciate the cover and it does help protect it as well. As good as the factory original. Thanks for the tip from one of the other reviewers to drill a small hole in the top of the cap in order to attach the existing leash. (It doesn't come with one) Well built with a weatherproof cover; comes with two keys and will protect your hitch or what ever you need to protect.

Looks just like the old one so it is not odd. Easy install and perfect fit, holds the door just right It is clear and the flip thing works fine.  It fit my stock mount on my windshield perfectly.  It does come with a mount for you to use, just no glue.  But, as I said, it fit my old one with no problems at all. the bag it came with dosent fit it, if youve got it adjusted to the middle or top setting, this does exactley what they say, seems pretty rugged, it fits my duratrac 245/75/16s perfect and holds my 225lb self no prob. 
This works great. It's sturdy and fit's nice and snug in a standard 5 gallon bucket. I will be ordering more of these in the future. Works great. Fairly easy swap. Just be aware: The front window regulators are the same on whether you have a Suburban or Tahoe or one of their GM family members. Not so for the rear regulators. The full size SUVs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones. The vehicle input feature Amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference. The pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at, but the vehicle ID feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit. BEWARE!!!! Just so you know, the Dorman 741-578 and 741-579 fit the full size and the 748-228 and 748-229 fit the Tahoe size vehicles. They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these.

Good fit, be sure to measure your tires for fit. It was a good look in replacement of my old discolored cove. I keep the old one in RV to lay on when I need it. The price is very good. Thanks Folks This cabin filter is a perfect fit replacement filter for a 2004 4Runner V8 Sport.  Just slide the old one out and put this one in. my old one broke and this one was a pefect fit replacement. Just unscrewed the old one and used the new screws supplied. 
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. Exactly what was offered, fit nicely, no major prep work, won't fade or crack, adjusts perfectly, easy removal and fits under seat in truck good bungies, nice compact cover can litteraly fit in from fork pouch, thin but protective and fit a Dyna Glide without windshield very well 
Does what it supposed to do,Fits most of my scooters.Does not fit a Honda Shadow 750's disc brake, because the disc is too wide.One star less, because the mechanism to mount the pouch to the handlebars is very weak, and impractical (I can't install it on handlebars of scooters because they have the handlebars covered with plastic, and can't install it on the handlebars of my motorcycle, because the hand grips and throttle are too wide, so it does not fit; the pouch also does not have a locking mechanism, so it's kind of moot to try to mount it somewhere).Otherwise, a great purchase! I have an old 55 GMC with a Napco 4wd on 37 inches tires and it stands pretty high. Even getting to the oil dip stick is a challenge without a step.That tire step is really great, it unfolds and installs in 2 seconds over the tire. It fits my 37x12.5 (it won't work with a bigger tire) and is pretty stable.It comes with a nice pouch with handles to carry it with you everywhere you go. It folds nicely and can be stored under your seat. A really great item, and I am considering buying a 2nd one so that I can have one on each side when I am working in the engine bay of the truck. 3 things.#1 Spring is cheep and installed incorrectly. Snapped on unpacking so i had to twist it to place it the right (better) way and twist the ends toward inside more, because spring is made of cheep metal that bends like aluminum.#2 Size is too big for regular car filters. Toyotas/Hondas/Motorcycles ETC. Maybe a 5Lite For 3500 utility van will have enough filter diameter for this to fit around, or a huge SUV or a pickup truck.#3 Removal only. does not work the other way around to tight the filter. 
I love the nut on top of the K&N oil filters.  Makes it easy to change on my CBR Blackbird.  I change the oil frequently so am not sure how well the media cleans the oil. I changed out all my rear diff fluid with this Lucas oil. I mean, its just diff oil, but with lucas, you cant go wrong: synthetic 75w140 for all temps, limited slip friction modifiers already in there, this is erfect use for those who want to do this, and not change it again in a long time.only con, the one gallon jug is kinda hard to use to fill the small fill hole without a funnel, alternaively, you can get 4 of those 1 quart squirt bottles and it would be easier. I do high mileage intervals using 100% synthetic oil in my car.  I always use this on the last tankful of gas before an oil change.  It's amazing how much gunk winds up in the oil after running this stuff through the system.  It definitely loosens carbon deposits as the oil turns pitch black after a tankful of this gas and a 20 oz bottle of Techron.  The oil after a full change remains pretty clear for quite a while so I'm pretty confident pairing this with an oil change is beneficial. The mechanic at the dealer commented on how clean my engine was when they did a TSB job on it compared to another car from the same year with similar mileage. 
Mobil 1 V-Twin 20W-50 Synthetic Motor Oil for Motorcycle is great synthetic oil for your bike and the price is very competitive. l've been using Purolator for a while in combination with my 15k mobil oil. protects my cars engine every 10k While BMW claims the differential oil is a &#34;lifetime&#34; fill, replacing the oil periodically (30 to 50,000 mile intervals) will prolong the life of the drivetrain.  And the Red Line product is the best there is. 
If you own a Hi-Lift, I may suggest to have this repair kit. You don't know when you will have to use it. ...and perfectly-suited for the intended purpose. That's all I can - or need to - say about it. Case closed. I don't need a gallon of this stuff.  I don't need a quart.  I don't even need a pint... so this was the perfect size to have on hand for occaional small engine reassembly and repair. 
This glove is great it holds the shampoo and remove all the dirt from your car without scratch your paint Used to remove Nu Finish paste. Worked very well with no lint or fluff left behind. Wiped up all the polish without leaving powdery residue behind. I always use genuine gm parts in all of my vehicles and never have any problems. The wire set came with dielectric grease in the boots to protect the spark plug and wire so they can be remove easily. 
The Tender Jr. does not come with a cigarette adapter so I cut this in half to make two. I purchased 2 lighter plugs for a buck each from China&#8230; with free shipping&#8230; and they are working fine. These aren&#8217;t an exact match with the Tender cables but they fit together OK and are easy to determine polarity with the wire colors. You can also just use this as an extension cord for your Tender. The description states a length of 12-inches&#8230; but it&#8217;s actually 14-inches tip-to-tip on the connectors. Nice item for the price and it&#8217;s made in Mexico. The size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous. The funnel is 10" long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6" long. It states that the funnel is 4" x 4" but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2-1/4" in diameter at the widest point.It would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless. Sizes listed in reviews and the two in the description (15.8 x 10.5 x 5, and 12.5 x 9.5 x 7) don't match to what I received...The bag I received is in between what has been listed in the descriptions:  13.5" x 9" x 6" (empty).While seemingly a good quality bag, with a fair amount of straps and attached rain-cover (hidden in the heel of the bag), it seems the manufacturer (or seller) has no idea how to use a measuring tape!The bag itself is quite nice... good padding, rubberized bottom to prevent sliding, small pockets on either side, and zippers seem of reasonable quality.For the price and bag quality, I'm not complaining.  It works great on my CB750, and it does fit on the pillion of my VT1100c2 (without having to remove my rider backrest)  So if you have standard seating (or a touring/adventure style), this bag will do well for you as a pillion bag, and with a little strap adjustments, it also fits vertical on the front or back of a sissy-bar, or horizontal on a larger luggage rack... 
Just like the rest of the reviews, this thing fits perfectly in the Wrangler windshield. It's small, rolls up out of the way but it is pricey - but all the custom fit ones are - what r u going to do. These work well.  Had to drill more holes because they are not a direct fit for the originals.  They look good. The price was right and it was delivered on time, however, it was not as durable as I imagined and was a little smaller than it looked to be in the picture.  It was also a little flimsy when extended to it's supposed maximum size.  I would not buy it again as my vents are larger and this is just not adequate for the intended purpose.  However, if the vents were not as wide, it would be acceptable. 
Not only do they not fit, very thin and wonder how long they will last.  Also if you have batteries with the post and screw/nut the latter is not covered. I used this to change the plugs in my F-150. You can get away with a extension and socket but this is the right size to not be to long or two short. I was suprised how well and how easy they worked even on an extended van.  It saves wear and tear on the shoulders. 
Works great, nice to have a second cable, but the OBD end of the cable is angled.  In my case, this cable won't work on my Subaru Outback.  I would prefer the option of a straight OBD connector.  Note that the angle connector works on my other four cars (Mazda, Honda, Dodge). I purchased this belt for my 2003 Chevy Tahoe. I had no idea Chevy would put 2 serpentines on a newer generation vehicle. This smaller belt fits the A/C system only. It works like a champ and fits perfectly. I would recommend the Gatorback belts to EVERYONE! As an installation side note, you have to remove the air intake and larger serpentine to get to this "bottom of the motor" mounted unit.... way to engineer that one GM! This O2 sensor was a direct replacement for the original part.  Wire was the correct length and wires/plug matched original perfectly.  Easy install and I have seen a few MPG increase in fuel economy since installation.  The replacement of these sensors will also help ensure longer catalytic converter life.  Very happy with this purchase.

PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars I haven't really used it yet for the reason intended, changing the oil in my jet ski.  So, I can't comment on how well it works.  The main reason for this review is to put it out there that it does not work with a 2000 Chevy Silverado.  The siphon tube does not fit thru the bottom of the dip stick tube.  It would be really nice if Mityvac had a published list of what vehicles it works with and what ones it does not.  I have my fingers crossed that it'll work with my jet ski, otherwise there will be a new/(un)used Mityvac on *****'slist.  Long story short, do your research to see if you can confirm or deny if it will work with your vehicle before you buy it. They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods.

This 30W non-detergent oil is what you should use in your 4 cycle lawn mower or garden tractor.I have a garden tractor with a 26 HP Kohler engine and this 48oz is exactily how much the engine uses when you change the oil and filter. I like not having left over new oil. That lets me use the container for the used oil.  Ordering was convenient and shipping was fast. I need this pump for every 100k miles when I change differential oil. There are two holes: bottom one is for oil drain and the top bolt is for oil fill. I use this pump to pump Gear oil using the top fill hole up to the point that oil will sip out. I don't think I can do it without this pump. USES: MMO can be used in a car to clean out the entire fuel system, including the fuel pump, and fuel injectors. On an older vehicle, this can also clean out your carburetor, which normally can become troublesome with age. Like I said earlier, MMO is also a trade secret to those who race cars, many will swear by this product.MMO can also be used in RV's, which use diesel engines or the big rigs as well. It can also be used in, boats, ATV's, and landscaping equipment such as, mowers, trimmers, blowers. I also like MMO, cause it can be used in the oil crankcase of every engine. Over time, your engine can develop carbon deposits, having MMO in the crankcase will clean out these deposits. Then you can get rid of them at your next oil change.MY EXPERIENCE: My experience with MMO has been well, marvelous! I have been using it in my landscaping equipment for years now. And I find that machines, which I am treating with MMO, last longer then those that are not treated. For example, I can run MMO in the gas and oil of a Briggs V-Twin engine. I can then have another duplicate engine next to it without the MMO treatment.I can run both engines for 48 hours, and I can guarantee you, if I pull them both apart, the engine which was treated with MMO, will be the cleanest one. Another difference is with valve lifter ping, I am sure you have heard that from your engine before. Treat your engine with MMO, and I can guarantee you that the ping will go away. Why? Because, MMO cleans and lubricates your valve lifters.THE MANTIS TILLER: As some of you may know, I used to own a 2-cycle Mantis tiller. Well, after it was 3-years old, I was having some major troubles with it. What it needed was a carburetor rebuild kit, but since I was on the job, I had no time for that! I grabbed my bottle of MMO, which I bring with me, I applied two cap-fulls of this stuff to the tank. After running the engine at full throttle for 10-minutes, all of the sudden I gained engine power. And I was able to sustain smoother throttle response as well.

Exact replacement for my transmission on my F-150 2001 transmission.  Use the original gasket as stated by manufacturer and drop pan and remove and insert new filter&#8230;add fluid and you're good to go REPLACE THEM AT 90,000 MILES AND ENGINE FEELS SMOOTHER AND MORE RESPONSIVE... I CHECKED ON ACDELCO CATALOG AND GAVE ME THIS PART NUMBER FOR MY TRUCK..REPLACED THE SPARK PLUGS WITH IRIDIUM AC DELCO AS WELL.. Buy it and put it in.  Exact OEM replacement.  My engine had a front and back, so I replaced both at the same time. 
Fabulous unit, compact, quiet, powerful, and not too heavy. I cut off the alligator clamps and wired it to a 7-way trailer connector so that I can plug it in to the rear of my truck. 12v is only present when the truck is running so this is a foolproof setup. I like the 100% duty cycle although I do not expect that to be an issue. I bought both the driver's and passenger side regulators when I installed factory power windows and mirrors in my 2000 Sierra. I wanted new parts because I didn't trust the regulators from the donor truck I used for parts to complete this project. The regulators installed perfectly and worked just like they would if my truck came from the factory with power windows.Pick up a pair if you are converting your truck over or replacing the factory worn-out regulators. You won't be disappointed. I am car-sitting a vehicle that mostly sits in my garage.  I don't drive it nearly enough to keep the battery charged.  I am also convinced that Fords have a damn trickle as this car drains a battery faster than anything else I have seen [maybe not as fast as a snooty BMW].  I spent a hoop of time looking on line for a quality product.  This one was well reviewed on many forums and after going to the factory web page I was convinced.  Amazon had the BEST price period.  I ordered four to start, one for Dad [has a truck he rarely drives], one for car I "baby-sit", one of wife's Jeep it sometimes does not get driven for days which is only a concern during cold Illinois winters, and my truck which always is outside [does not fit in garage] and thought it would be a good idea on those super cold nights when I also plug in my battery blanket and oil heater.I installed two so far and it was very easy!  The unit is designed to be permanently mounted under the hood, it comes with a bracket and some screws.  The first thing I did [I know it voids any warranty] is open it up and de-solder three wires from the short 12" cord and upgrade to a 14 gage 3 conductor cord of adequate single length.  I routed and zip-tied it to blend in with all of the other factory wires and ran it to the front lower valance [bumper] where I fabricated a simple aluminum bracket with grommet pull-through opening and terminated at a plug.  Now to use all I have to do is plug it in, no need to even open the hood.  With it disconnected you can barely see the plug from behind the license plate.  Total time about an hour and a half, if you are less particular I guess you could toss it in and be up and running in 10 minutes.  So far very happy, I have taken some measurements of the capabilities and thay are as claimed.  Almost forget, pics on amazon are not totally accurate, does not gome with a fuse holder for battery side.  I added a 5A blade fuse with all weather holder to the positive side between unit and battery for peace of mind. 
Be sure to check with the Auto or Truck Manufacturer to find the correct SIZE of Oil Filter for your vehicle. Amazon's Parts Locator says that the Motorcraft  FL820S does not fit my 1995 Mercury Grand Marquis, 4.6 Litre V-8 engine. This is incorrect. The fact is that the Motorcraft FL820S is the FORD-recommended filter for my 1995 Mercury engine, and is recommended in almost every application of the Ford /Mercury/Lincoln 4.6 Litre engine size.The Motorcraft FL820S interchanges with the BOSCH 3410, the FRAM TG2, and the K&N; 2010.The Motorcraft FL820S  has over 50 pleats, high flow rate, silicone anti-drainback valve, and steel end caps.Amazon's current low price ($3.69) is an excellent value for a quality oil filter that's MADE IN USA !!My car is driven in heavy traffic, desert temperatures, mountain driving, and trans-desert trips from Phoenix to L.A.The standard FORD Motorcraft Filters performed just as well as the high-dollar types -- and filtered MUCH better than the K&N;, which has a very high flow rate (for racing), but the low 90% efficiency rating of the K&N; makes it a no-no for extended oil changes. I wouldn't run a K&N; oil filter for more than 3,000 miles -- you'd just be stirring up dirty oil and pumping it through the bearings !! :>(For my American V-8 engine, I have found the best value to be the Motorcraft FL820S Oil Filter and Mobil 1 5-W-20 Extended Life (Synthetic) engine oil. The quality of the oil filter allows for filter changing every 5,000 miles, and the engine oil is changed once-a-year, regardless of miles driven.For maximum oil life, be sure your PCV system is working properly -- Remove and wash out the PCV Valve with Carburetor  Cleaner, and check for collapsed and/or damaged PCV hoses. A leaking PCV system will suck un-filtered dirt right into your engine !!1995 Mercury Grand Marquis RS225 HP 4.6 Litre SOHC V-8Modified Air Box w/ K&N; Air FilterBosch Impeller Fuel PumpBosch 19 Lb.

Two of my code tables show as Bank 1 Sensor 2 A/F sensor so I ordered the Denso 234-4209 O2 sensor. Came in on time and package well protected but looks like its the wrong one - my fault, somewhat. Turns out, as far as I could tell, my two tables from two different sources had it backwards as it should be Bank 2 Sensor 1 A/F and Denso/Amazon order check didn't help much either.Anyway, Bank 2 Sensor 1 is the one on the engine right front (easy to get to) where Denso refer as Upstream Front. I gave it 5 stars base on previous experience, will order this one later.Why the a few of you refer as Bank 1 Sensor 1 and still corrected the check engine light? That would not be this one for the the Toyota V6 but Denso 234-9007 where they refer as Upstream Rear. Am I wrong?Seems like I'm not the only one confused based on superceeded information on P1150 and P1155.This one is for Bank 2 Sensor 1 for the Toyota V6 engine (mine is the 1MZFE). Perfect for exhaust work.  I bought it for a catalytic converter and o2 sensor project because it is rated for: -30F to 1800F 
IT WORKSI NEEDED ONEIT WAS CHEAPIT DID THE JOBI MAY NEVER NEED IT AGAIN AS I MYSELF DON'T FORCE DOUBLE THREADED THINGS BUT OTHERS ARE APPARENTLY NOT SO INTELLIGENT.$400 STIHL CONCRETE SAW IS BACK ON THE JOBI WIN ANOTHER ONE.I WILL PROBABLY LOOSE IT DUE TO PREDATION ETC BEFORE I NEED IT AGAIN BUT UNTIL THEN I CAN CORRECT ANY CARELESS PLUG SCREWING THAT MAY COME MY WAY. I think it will do just what I want. I got it for power outages and it powers my TV just fine. I realize that there are testimonials for this product actually doing what it says it will do.  I have not had an occasion to need it in an emergency.  AND - I hope that I never do.  It does not inspire confidence.  It feels like something that would be included in a child's toy tool set.  Extremely lightweight.  Directions state you must hit the window in a specific location - good luck with that in an emergency.  I was hoping for a tool with enough weight, which added to acceleration, would break the window.  Again, I have not used it, and I will not trust it in an emergency - so I will be looking for a better product.  I do not recommend this item...at any cost. 
GIVES YOU THAT EXTRA 5 FEET YOU NEED  GREAT...CAN SET MY LAPTOP ON MY BENCH INSTED OF BENDING OVER IN CAR WITH A BAD BACK. Great way to keep your tongue jack from resting on wet ground or concrete, likely extending the life by not letting it rust out so quick.  Using with a tow package that includes a weight distribution assembly can prove problematic for smaller SUV's/cars though (tested with a 2008 Ford Escape with Class 3 hitch), as the tongue jack stand is so tall that you have to sometimes jack up your car up to clear it!  Still, I can't fault the jack stand for that.  Highly recommended. Perfect for washing the RV...strong pole you can scrub as high as you need to go or can leverage. Holds its position when set.  Very pleased. 
IT WORKS Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering/suspension work.  You will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover.I hate to use the pickle fork.  The pickle fork is the last resort for me, as it will damage the balljoint boot.I prefer to use the Snap On balljoint remover.  If that one cannot fit, then I will try this tool.  If this tool will not fit, then I will resort to a pickle fork. Exact replacement from OEM. Exact fit worked perfect . Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs. 
I tried this on my Exterior Black sidings and bumpers and it doesn't last long.  But on the interior black this product works well.  It keeps my interior black and new look.  I gave this an OK product but not really impressed with it.  Let's see how long my interior look last on this Black to Black product.  But for now it's an OK product. Hella Replacement.  Kinda.  Mine came with BLUE wire.. they should always be white. Its also not covered in fabric and the white ones are. My Harley has a lot if black on the motor. It's a 2003 and very gradually the black will loose it's rich dark look. This product really brought back that dark rich look. I recommend it. 
I probably should compare it to another to see how accurate it is, but I really like how easy it is to use and turns off and on by itself. I wanted to get this because I seem to be the only "car guy" in the household and amongst extended family (some 20+ people all in Dallas).I do all of my own car work, and could easily do simple battery voltage checks with a multimeter, but a device like this is important, because it measures amps correctly (and simply), something you don't want to do with most multimeters without calculating the proper size resistor to use inline or risk frying your multimeter.  Basically, this is a device designed to measure automotive voltage, plus check cold cranking amps, cranking amps, and load testing.The 3 stars is mainly for the usability.  First, the display (the most important thing!) is hard to read because it uses large LED bars to write out the words.  Let me explain - the first test is the battery test.  When you select the battery test, it reads "baFF" rather than "batt" only because the manufacturer chose to use a very simplistic display that doesn't have enough "bars" to create easy to read words.  It's like trying to make words with a calculator if that makes any sense.  (I will try to upload a picture later)Next, of all devices that truly need a carrying case, this one does, if only to hold the instruction manual.  It is not intuitive to use without the manual (primarily because the words are very hard to decipher or read).  There's a "glossary" on the back, but it doesn't include everything, nor the steps for each of the tests, if it DID, I would've added 1 more star.Then, on top of that, the manual somewhat confuses you a little in determining what type of battery you have.  For example, for battery types you must choose from the following:SLI - Starting/Lighting/Ignition Flooded batteryFLAT - Traditionally shaped AGM batteriesSPL - AGM-designated spiral wound batteriesGEL - Gel cell batteriesNow of the 4, what type of battery do you have???  I checked 3 cars and none have any of this written on the battery themselves.  I can only assume SLI makes the most sense.  Ideally, this would be explained a little better or use "Conventional, Marine/Deep-Cycle, Maintenance Free" wording instead.Overall, I feel 3 stars is fair for the usability - the item still works and seems to validate known good and known bad batteries and charging systems, but don't lose the instruction manual and good luck being able to read the too-simplistic screen. I own both a travel trailer and a sailboat, so needed a method to check battery condition as well as charging ability of my truck's system.  This unit addresses both needs.  I was surprised at how large and heavily constructed it was, but am pleased at its obvious durability. There was some confusion on my part initially on how to read one of the scales, and feel they could do a little better in explaining that. But, it's easy to figure out once connected to a battery.  Simple and straight-forward to use, no college degree or inch-thick operating manual required.  Just hook up and read.  Purchase with confidence. 
necessary for your lawn mower. I used also for my motorcycle. Works well for me because of the low profile.  I use it for draining the oil in all my small engines (lawn mower, power washer, etc...), my mototcycles and sport cars.Lays flat for safe transport to oil recycling point. My wife and I own a small farm/orchard in Arizona.  We have many farm implements from tillers to tractors to utility carts that have pneumatic tires, and need protection from all the hazards of off-road farm use.  This slime fills our needs perfectly.  Not a single flat since using it in our equipment. 
Have used it for several applications besides my MAF, and will be using it on a regular basis as needed. In the past I have used nylon plugs but they are difficult to remove over time.  The drain valve I purchased is installed semi permanently and the drain cock only needs to opened to winterize the water heater. this filter is easy to install but sometimes can be a pain to remove. better filter then the fram or advance filters for sure 
Most manufacturers use a variation of lubricant similar to ATF to insure smooth shifting, even when the transmission is cold. They also rarely specify a change interval.  If you want the best lubricant for your manual transmission, MTL is it.  It requires a slow hand on frigid days, but will insure the transmission will last the life of the vehicle. This is a great item.  Works well.  Indicator lights let you know the status of the battery.  Very pleased with this battery tender. Works great with my 90 amp alternator and 800 watt amp. I absolutely do not run the stereo/sub/amp without the engine running, so the battery should last quite a while. Arrived in perfect condition with adequate packaging. 5 stars unless it dies in an unreasonable amount of time, at which point I'll update my review if it comes to that.Update: More than 1 year with this battery and it still works flawlessly, despite having been in a couple serious accidents. This battery is a champ. 
Installed on a motorcycle works great.  Cord included allows for permanent install and can be used for accessories when not charging.  Great price. It is used to replace my OEM filter but no improvement can be seen both in performance or gas mileage. I originally purchased this to use in conjunction with myEquus 3721 Battery and Charging System Monitorbecause I wanted to get an accurate reading of my car battery's voltage. Using that device plugged directly in the the lighter port was not accurate because my car's electrical system is all powered up along with the lighter port.I also use this adapter now when using my car vac (with engine running) as well. It can also be used with powerful air compressors that would normally blow the lighter fuse in your car as this enables you to plug those directly to the battery, bypassing the car's fuses. 
a regular 32mm socket will not fit in the space of my equinox. this is a kind of shorter 32mm socket designed only for oil filter cap job. it works fine. Works great, nice to have a second cable, but the OBD end of the cable is angled.  In my case, this cable won't work on my Subaru Outback.  I would prefer the option of a straight OBD connector.  Note that the angle connector works on my other four cars (Mazda, Honda, Dodge). Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. 
I probably should compare it to another to see how accurate it is, but I really like how easy it is to use and turns off and on by itself. It may be hard to believe how many trailers get stolen because some thief pulls up, hooks up, and is gone. With the lock, they can't hook up to the trailer. This is a must for travel trailer owners. We bought this for our RV (2008 Mercedes Sprinter chassis) and it works great.  I can see how many miles are left until an empty tank, watch the mpg, monitor engine temp, and lots of other things.  Be sure to read the manual for how to calibrate your mileage readings.  We mounted the ScanGauge on our dashboard using the provided velcro strips.  That approach was okay, but I would like to find a sturdier way to mount it.  If you're handy, you can mount it on your dash and run the cable through the insides to get to the OBDII port.  You have the option of having the cable connected to the ScanGauage either on the right side or out the back.  No additional electrical source is needed, since the OBD port is powered. 
Well made Excellent quality.  American made.  Top notch all the way around.  Built to last. Great quality.  American made. 
After using the very best and most expensive products from the world over this product is on top of them all.Make several applications like every week for the fisrt month latter once a month for 3 months after that every 6 months: better than new!! If you want the very best well this is the one.This is a first step you apply every week for one month and nothing else. Wait...The second month you apply some 3 hours after applying this product the Mothers Gold Carnanuba wax.You'll be amazed and very happy.After the above, apply this product every 6 months to a year.It's a basic I bought this tire gauge a a little over two months ago. The first few times I used it, it performed admirably. It's ergonomic, with a clear LCD display that gave a fast, precise reading.Fast forward to the end of June. After only three uses (and being stored in my glove compartment otherwise), the gauge is now wildly off. After reading the tires on my truck as 32 PSI four weeks ago, plugging it in today registered 41.5 PSI. I thought maybe it was the heat we've had this past week, but a change of 9.5 PSI seemed a little high, so I tested it with two other tire gauges, which read 33 and 33.5 PSI, respectively. I used a pump with a manual gauge to drain a tire and inflate it to 33 PSI, but when I tested the tire with this gauge it read it first as 41.5 PSI and ten seconds later as 40 PSI.Perhaps I got a dud, but any gauge that's off by that much so soon raises a red flag for me. I'll be looking for my next tire gauge elsewhere. 
A number of reviewers have commented that the accuracy of this gauge is 0.1 psi.  It isn't.  The accuracy spec is +- 0.5 psi +- 1% of the reading.  This means that the gauge could show anything between 34.1 to 35.9 for a tire actually filled to 35 psi.Long story short...don't believe that 1/10 digit number that's being displayed.  If there's a slight change in tire pressure, it'll show it, but the actual value can vary significantly from what's shown. Bought this because I wanted to measure the length of a specific body part of mine.  Unfortunately a ruler was too big to measure the length of it.  I needed something very small in order to figure out how long it is. Be advised, this bit is 3 and 1/2 inches long. Description says 5.7 inches long which is NOT correct.  Did not work with my air hammer. Its too short does not have enough space to travel when installed on the quick release. So will have to return and get a longer one. 
This buffer has plenty of power to get the job done, and appears to be well worth the money.  Some minor assembly is required.  There is a `manual' but it does not contain any instructions, instead it mostly covers general safety.  Assembly is fairly simple.  You first attach the curved top handle, either with or without, the straight side handle.  The handle can be installed for either right or left hand operators.  The buffer is top heavy, so installing the side handle is highly recommended.This unit comes with the accessories to get started right away.  For buffing, it has a wool pad, and rubber backing pad.  For sanding, a Velcro backed hard plastic disc is included, but you will need to provide the sandpaper inserts.  A special wrench for locking down the rubber backing pad is included.Controls are pretty basic.  There is a throttle switch on the bottom of the handle, with a lock button to keep the motor running.  The speed control dial is on the top of the housing, and goes from 1 to 6 (maximum).  The buffer starts to whine at around level 3, and gets screaming loud at full speed, when ear protection is definitely recommended.  The amount of vibration will vary according to the task, and motor speed.  When sanding or buffing fine dust is typically produced, so you may want to wear eye protection and a dust mask.If you are into weightlifting, using the buffer on a vehicle may not be too difficult, but for those not so physically fit, managing the weight and vibration, could be a challenge.  Because of the tool is about 18 inches long, your hands end up positioned about a foot apart, in order to keep the torque generated by the buffer under control.  Just a little inattention can result in losing control, or dropping the buffer, and you don't want to hurt yourself, damage your paint job, dent your vehicle, or damage anything else.The supplied wool buffer is quite thick, and does a pretty good job, but you do need to apply pressure for it to work.  For the average sedan, buffing the hood and trunk should be the easiest.  Things get harder when you do the sides, or curved or irregular surfaces, and have to both support the weight of the buffer, and apply pressure to the surface.  Buffing non-flat areas usually requires changing angles, and varying the point of contact, and amount of pressure applied.  Users will need to find the grip and techniques that work best.  Buffing will require some finesse at times, and if your muscles are straining, this is when accidents can happen, or you can hurt yourself.  Doing the roof can be tricky as well.The listed weight of eight pounds, may not sound like a lot, but if you are bracing your body, locking your forearms, and squeezing hard on the handles for an extended period of time, you may find your muscles a bit sore, or in `shock' from the vibration, if you overdo it.  Just go easy when using it for the first few times.The pictured buffer has a blue plastic housing and black handle, but the unit also comes with an orange plastic housing.  It has a ten foot cord with a twin blade plug, and comes with a set of spare brushes.  The buffer does produce very good results, so if you have a strong back, and the upper body strength, it could be a very cool buy. Great wheel lock that is easy to activate and unlock.  It comes with 3 keys, one of which has a LED light on it.  The product also comes with a reminder cord that attaches to the handle bar as a reminder.  It does just what I was looking for. First things first...any protection this offers is purely incidental. You are fastening a metal grid to a plastic lens. Duh. But from a style standpoint, it does dress up the tail light assembly. One bar does pass right in front of theback up light which does diminsh its function. Installation is very simple. Directions are clear. The item is a bit pricey but the quality is good and the paint job good. It is a simple way to dress up your ride. 
This thing has 2 readouts and 4 scales and no instructions on how to read any of htem.  The SWR is easy enough to figure out but the others are anyones guess, came with some little wire antenna that is nowhere in the one sheet instruction that comes with it.  The signal strength meter dosn't seem to register at all.  It was cheap enough and probelly works, but your  have to find an engineer to tell you how to use it. Although it is usually easy to spot a "bald" tire (i.e. one with virtually no tread), you cannot "eyeball" tire tread depth any more than you can "eyeball" the air pressure in your tires. Instead you need the right tool. Although this is one of the more expensive tire tread depth gages on the market, the quality of construction and ease of use justify the price, and definitely merit the five star ratings this product has received. Here is why I like it:1. This tool has a nice heft, is made out of nicely finished metal rather than cheap plastic, and comes with a hard shell foam padded case, which can easily fit into a glove compartment (the dimensions of the closed case in inches are 6 3/8 by 2 7/8 by 1 1/4). The quality construction is evident. This is a very well made tool, and looks better in person than in the picture.2. This is simple to use. Just loosen the lock screw, push the slide so the narrow point on the left is flush with the metal face, turn the unit on, press the zero button (or alternatively just adjust the slide until it reads zero on the digital display), choose whether you want mm, inches in decimals (tenths of an inch) or inches in fractions (64ths of an inch), put the metal face flush on the tire, push the slide from the "ruler" side until the narrow point reaches the bottom of the tread, and see the digital readout. The whole process takes just seconds.I like that you can simultaneously see the reading mechanically on the "ruler" part of the slide, which is marked in mm and 32nds of an inch. The new tires that I buy for my cars typically start at 10/32 of an inch (though this can vary depending on the kind of tire, so you need to check what the tread starts out as on whatever tires you are using). Therefore a reading of 5/32 for me means 50% of my tread is gone, at which point I usually replace the tire.3. Opening the battery compartment and installing the battery are simple. This product comes with the necessary battery (and in fact mine also came with a spare).4. The digital display is easy to read, and the digital reading remains on the screen until you either turn the unit off or "zero it out" to take another reading. Although I wear glasses, I can easily see the display even without them on. The digital display eliminates any guesswork as to the reading, though as noted above, you can also simultaneously look at a mechanical reading just to confirm the digital readout.5. I have my oil changed at a place that indicates the tread depth on each tire, but I bought this unit so that I could check myself between oil changes, and also verify the readings I am given. This tool easily and accurately lets me do that.Bottom line: If you like using quality tools that are easy to use and work effectively, then I recommend this product for checking your tire tread depth. This tool is handy for me to periodically check the wear on my tires, and is also useful for those who like to buy used tires, or are considering buying a used car and want to check the tire tread depth. The meter has all the functions you could ask for a multimeter in a compact size.  The digits are large for the size of the meter, so it's easily readable by middle aged eyes. 
with plastic bumpers being the norm, thought I'd use this plastic polish.  It brings the shine to the plastic painted areas just like step 2 does to the metal. Very quick and easy mounting and really adds to the look of the rear of the Jeep.  These are metal and not a cheap plastic and mount with included screws into the existing lens cover screw holes. This is surely the gauge you should get if you are looking for one. The build is industrial strength. And it is made in USA and not in China ! The rubber hose is pliable enough for easy use. Nicely slots into the valve without loss of air and the head pivots for easy viewing. The gauge is absolutely accurate. The dial is large and easy to read. The bleed valve is conveniently located and works fine when pressed. The cover is a must. Getting it over the dial is an effort. Do not follow the instructions on the package or you may damage the seal. Thread the tube through the eye of the cover, pull it up to the guage and then stretch and wrap it over the dial. Make sute that the flange on the cover runs over the edge of the glass on the dial for max protection. It would appear impossible but the rubber is soft and it will stretch. Have a beer after.The dial is heavy - Moroso should supply a foam bag or something similar to store the gauge in the boot. I am sure folks would pay a couple of bucks gladly for that. 
The picture is slightly misleading. This is only the mounting bracket - it does not come with any wiring. But is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a 4 wire flat cable. The bracket is flat on one side, and curved on the other. The curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch. The connector on the end of my T connector fits well, and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket. It sure beets having the connector flopping around! Easy to replace. It lacks Toyota instructions, but it is exactly like existing Toyota part with all wires colored the same way so it is very obvious how to connect those.The original part has a silicone rubber tube going all the way from top to bottom with wires running inside it. This part only provides a short length of tubing that, at best, would cover half of the length of wires on my car.I thing they should provide a &#34;telescoping&#34; tubing of two diameters with one going inside of the other while you are crimping wires and then extended to cover the full length of wires I had a time trying to keep the connections from leaking. As you tighten the connector on it would torque the hose and it would unwind and loosen the connector causing a leak. I ended up putting a pressure regulator on that had a rotating connector. It allowed the hose to untorque itself without unscrewing the connector. 
Pros: battery driven; flashing or steady light; flameless flare; can be used as a map light; reusable. Could be used effectively as a light that does not seriously degrade night vision.Cons: Product claims to be visible at 1000 ft, but this is only possible within a few degrees of view. One half of the top lights up for a dim presentation, but the bright LED shines out through a narrow beam like a small red flashlight. Consequently, the flare would probably not be useful in a traffic situation since it would have to be precisely aligned with oncoming traffic and would only be visible by the few drivers within this narrow beam of light. It is certainly not a good substitute for a real flare which is much brighter and omnidirectional. This little light is not as good as the emergency flashers built into vehicles.If you want a safety flare to carry in your vehicle, buy the real thing. If you want a light you can use as a map light without distracting a driver, or to see where you're walking without seriously degrading your night vision, this red light will do that well. 1996 to 1999 Chrysler/Dodge minivan owners have to live with weak headlight configurations. The overburdened single bulb provides both high and low beams in a poorly designed mirror/housing lens.Over years the plastic lens fog/pit from road debris along with the OEM bulbs yellowing.  Replacing the inexpensive (aftermarket +/-$40) lens housing is relatively easy for the DIYer.  Coupled with these Sylvania bulbs and one approaches the original brightness of showroom fresh headlight brightness.  But do not expect more. These KC&#8217;s light up dark & lonely places with brilliant, far reaching, white light even better than I had imagined they would. Install was easy on my &#8217;11 JK using Smittybilt 7690 brackets. The switch works great & adjustment of the beams was easy & positive with a 14mm wrench for the horizontal & a 13mm socket & extension for the vertical. Antenna interference with the passenger side light was avoided by angling the antenna back behind the light. Nice product! 
This tire gauge has an easy to read backlit display. The handle gives a nice grip but it can require an awkward angle with certain rims and not always be as easy as smaller units. Easy to replace.

One is 400Hz and the other one is 500Hz.PIAA | Automotive Sports Horn (400/500Hz) #85110The are exact fits on the mounts as the OEM horns and use the same bolts. A 1/4 inch drive ratchet and a 12mm socket is needed to remove and install the bolt. They came with grounding leads with ring spade lugs that mounted readily under the existing M6 bolts on the radiator supports. All you need is a 10mm socket.The two wiring harness leads are too short to connect the horns. Two wire tie mounts hold the harness to the aluminum bumper reinforcement. You can cut off the ties and use the OEM harness to connect the horns, but I chose not to.  I prefer NOT to cut off the OEM connector blocks.I made two pigtail extensions out of 18 gauge black primary wire, 5 inches long. One end needs a 1/4 inch wide exposed male quick disconnect. The other end needs an insulated female 1/4 inch quick disconnect terminal. Since I used 18 gauge wire, I used the red coded ones.The exposed male connector slides into the OEM horn connector perfectly. The female one clips easily onto the positive terminal of each horn.The horns how have a weather shield on the apertures.Best thing to my surprise is that they appear to be very high quality and Made in Japan.Also nice is that they need no modification to the horn relay or circuit.

Basically, this is a voltmeter, similar to a hand-held VOM, and designed to read static voltage and the voltage being pushed to the battery from the alternator as the engine revs ... automobile or motorcycle (having a 12v socket).  The cigarette lighter convenience is what attracted me ... I don't have to juggle a meter and wires with my head under the hood or standing alongside the bike trying to rev it and hold wires and meter, etc.  Tested it already and it seems dead-on with readings at or just a tad under what the hand-held shows.  It's coming on to winter and it's nice, when checking fluids and tire pressure, to do periodic checks on the charging system so you don't get that gut-dropping &#34;click-click-click&#34; when you turn the key in some dark, empty parking lot somewhere you don't want to be! This digital gauge is easy to use and to read, even in bright sun light. It has a wide range so you can use it on high pressure tires.Alot of gauges only go up to 60 psi which is too low for load range E tires. The 3rd generation powerprobe includes a number of changes for additional flexibility.  In short, it is a vehicle powered DVM with both a 20 foot cable and an additional 20 foot extension giving you a 40 foot working range around either the battery terminals or cigarette lighter outlet, both clips and a plug are included in the kit.With the series 3 units they use a hard gold plated banana jack to hold the removable probe or cables to extend your reach.  If you purchase the accessory kit, it includes piercing probes that self center on a conductor, pierce the insulation, and attach to the jack allowing you to tap a wire at any point to locate intermittant problems.While the DVM is backlit all the time, it also has 2 bright white LEDs facing forward to aid in finding and probing terminals in dark places.  The actual probe is hardgold plated with a sharp tip and removable at the banana jack.  Another identical probe is included with a screw-in female banana jack in the accessories kit to retrofit the powerprobe I and II units to accept external cables and probes.If you need to excite a circuit with a connection to battery ground or to battery positive, the switch allows a momentary connection to bridge the probe tip to either voltage which is useful in testing relay driven circuits, indicator lights, and other small current loads.  The prope voltage is always displayed during testing on the meter. The voltage/ground switch is circuit breaker protected in case you accidentally drive 12 volts into a chassis ground.  Additionally, since the switch takes abuse it is easily replaced if it fails with just a screwdriver.Combined with the testlead set, the powerprobe 3 greatly simplifies testing of vehicular wire and big rigs up to a single trailer.  The DVM has 5 selectable modes of operation designed for different problems.  Reading the manual is important to get the full value from this meter.Although the price is a little high, the design and construction quality are excellent.  Enough wire is provided to check running lights on trailers or to look for blown fuses.  All of the wiring is exceptionally flexible and heavily insulated with top quality connectors.  Both the tester and accessories come in hard plastic cases that can be stowed in a service box.Not mentioned in specifications is that although the probe runs from 12-24 VDC, the meter can be used to measure voltages up to 80VDC. 
I installed this brake controller in a 1955 GMC pickup truck that I use for towing. Just follow the diagram for wiring and it just works like a breeze. I like the way you can adjust easily the voltage with the dial on the left and the mounts provided allows you to install it a convenient location under the dash (it works in any position).If you want to install this in a more modern truck without tapping directly into the wires, you will need additional adapters at extra cost. What can I say, it installed and is functioning as a thermostat is designed to do. I did go from OEM 195 to this 180 but I won't get into the reasons as that doesn't pertain to the installation and function of this thermostat. fits my car perfectly, works perfectly, was easy to install. The best measure of a wiper blade is that it does what it is supposed to do, when it is supposed to do it. 
There is an acceptable itsy bitsy leak left. You can watch &#34;Fixing Oil Seal Leaks Fast&#34; video on YouTube by scottykilmer. You need 8 ounces for car engine or transmission usage, and 3 ounces for power steering. I am going to order more for power steering and transmission usage. This is a water additive that can potentially increase your cooling capacity by a few degrees by lowering surface tension and increasing boiling point. Used to replace transmission fluid in 01 Acura Integra automatic transmission, perfect length funnel to preform this process.  Sits perfect above engine t pour fluid in.  Cap on hose is nice to prevent mess. 
It say's that it doesn't fit on my 04 Crown Vic but, it does :) Just to let people know! i recommend it to everyone who has a hi lift jack or something like, to buy this product. it fits very snug, hard to fall off. it does exactly what it is suppose to. This product will do what is says it will do.  That being said, it does not inspire confidence in heavy use situations.  It does not appear very rugged.  Nice that it comes with the mount, but again the mount is very thin and light and probably won't last very long.  Also, the wire coloring does not match with the standard US codes.  White is ground on the item, while in most cases in the US, black is the ground wire.  Where was this thing made?  Again, it is a good price, and a useful product, but just beware it might be very rugged or reliable.  Make sure to read the enclosed documentation so that you match your wiring correctly. 
These bulbs work as described. The 4000Ks illuminate clear white for those who want no yellow or blue hues. They are definitely brighter than standard bulbs, but keep in mind nothing will emulate HID brightness. I replaced my Sylvania bulbs with these for Low Beams and these are just great!Good vision, white light, great coverage and none of that 'dingy' blue hue...I also bought/used the PIAA 9005 Intense White High Beam bulbs..... These bulbs are fantastic! They aren't "blue" at all. Instead they are pure white. If you look at the bulbs when they're turned on, they give a tiny hint of blue, but the light they emit is completely pure white. They light up the road VERY well and reflect much better off objects than my previous stock halogens. A VERY good buy!! 
Simple install, 2-wire hookup. Works as advertised. It can be installed at 2 different angles, gives an option for mounting. Heavy rubber, good gauge coated snap connectors; comes with variety of components necessary to test different configurations of sparkplug on vehicles/equipment.Has extended accessory to test recessed plugs, such as those on a Ford Triton engine (coil on plug setup).This test set will indicate YES/NO as to 'fire' - not a measurement of current.In sum, if I'm experiencing a miss at idle or under load, and static ohm's are good, and this tester indicates all plugs receiving fire, there is high probability a weak coil exists.  I then pull/reinsert plug wires one at-a-time while engine is running/stumbling to pinpoint faulty plug/wire/coil - (o'skool way).Kyle There are two horns, not one.

It's installed, had to cut the lines didn't have a choice for my vehicle.  Happy with this item.  For my vehicle the upper line was the return line to the transmission.  Opposite of what people generally believe.  Adequate adapters were not supplied.  My vehicle has a quick coupler fitting on the radiator.  No adapters were included for that, that's why I had to cut the lines and clamp on to the line.Happy with the item though.  It's working. Quality Automatic transmission Filter. Shipped fast, packaged well, and quality direct fitment. Looks the same as the OEM Filter.  Silver metal on one side, and black poly on the other side. If you drop and drain your transmission fluid pan, I highly recommend to change the transmission filter. Quick and Easy to install; pull straight down. This was a good fit for my 2004 Toyota Sienna XLE.  One thing to note is that the filter is not marked as to the orientation it should go inside the air cleaner assembly.  The side of the rubber gasket that has the groove on it goes down and the long edge with the notches in the groove go towards the front of the vehicle.  You can't get the cover back on with it incorrectly assembled but it would be nice for them to print on it the orientation.  Good quality though.  Visit my blog at johnfixesstuff.blogspot.com and search for air filter to get instructions with detailed pictures on how to install this filter on your Sienna.

Very quick and easy mounting and really adds to the look of the rear of the Jeep.  These are metal and not a cheap plastic and mount with included screws into the existing lens cover screw holes. Needed to replace a broken mirror.  This one fit right onto the existing metal holder that was still cemented to the windshield.  It has a lock-screw to hold it in place.  If you need to replace the metal holder, it is included but no glue is supplied.  Overall, it is a perfectly fine basic mirror. 
I bought this because Amazon suggested that it should be bought along with the brake controller. There is no need for it at all as the brake controller mounted just fine with the included hardware. great price, quick delivery - AWESOME customer Service from Camco - I ordered 2 kits, and one kit had one piece in the kit that needed to be replaced, and Camco replaced the entire kit for me. highly recommended I've been looking to purchase a new Jump pack for use in the shop and narrowed my selection down to either the Clore JNC660 or the Shumacker ProSeries DSR PSJ-2212The reviews were about equal on both so I decided to get the JNC660Well, I just received the JNC660 today and it is defective right out of the box.I plugged it in to charge and the amber led that is suppose to be lit does not indicate it is charging. The Green LED does not show it is fully charged either.I verified my power cord has power from the outlet; even switched to another cord.Disappointed; I guess companies no longer have QC on their products.UPDATE: Feb 04, 2014After realizing that Amazon will not accept returns on this item, I contacted Clore Automotive tech support and explained that I had received a defective jump pack. I reviewed with them the various items I had checked to confirm that it was indeed defective.After they confirmed that I had purchased it via Amazon, they shipped a new JNC660 to me along with a prepaid UPS label to return to them the defective unit. I had the replacement unit in 5 days after contacting them. The replacement unit works great.Clore Automotive gets 5 stars from me for making this disappointing defective unit right.

I used my own screws because of the material that I was mounting the bracket on. I had to tape one of the light adapter plugs as it was a loose fit in the bracket. 
IT WORKS Item works as described, saves crooks from sealing your gas. Key works smoothly in cap and with a turn its uocked Exact replacement from OEM. Exact fit worked perfect . Have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs. 
Need 2 for each side, works well for small pop up. Buy these over ones w/ rope and add your own rope, same choke. These already have the hole for rope. Dimensions given are inaccurate on these two, they are exactly the same size. The Tender Jr. does not come with a cigarette adapter so I cut this in half to make two. I purchased 2 lighter plugs for a buck each from China&#8230; with free shipping&#8230; and they are working fine. These aren&#8217;t an exact match with the Tender cables but they fit together OK and are easy to determine polarity with the wire colors. You can also just use this as an extension cord for your Tender. The description states a length of 12-inches&#8230; but it&#8217;s actually 14-inches tip-to-tip on the connectors. Nice item for the price and it&#8217;s made in Mexico. The meter has all the functions you could ask for a multimeter in a compact size.  The digits are large for the size of the meter, so it's easily readable by middle aged eyes. 
Looks and fits the same for a 2000 Toyota Sienna van. I ordered extra so I will not be without any at a later date. This cabin filter is a perfect fit replacement filter for a 2004 4Runner V8 Sport.  Just slide the old one out and put this one in. at first I thought it wouldn't fit but after sitting in the sun I was able to fit it over the steering wheel. look good 
It a belt... it fits, it hold and it rotates. There is no noise coming from it.Happy with the fit and performance. Exactly what was offered, fit nicely, no major prep work, won't fade or crack, adjusts perfectly, easy removal and fits under seat in truck Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. 
great price, quick delivery - AWESOME customer Service from Camco - I ordered 2 kits, and one kit had one piece in the kit that needed to be replaced, and Camco replaced the entire kit for me. highly recommended I was hoping to use the clay bar to remove water spots on a new truck but the one provided with this Mequiar's kit was worthless for this purpose. The kit does include everything you need to apply the products in the kit which is a plus and probably the reason the kit is so popular. I installed this as an addition to a Python 991 system.  The sensor was simple to install and the color-coded wires and instructions were clear.  For the price, this is a lot of additional protection for the money. 
These lights will be the main lighting in my Teardrop Camper Trailer when I get back to work on it next spring. They look like good quality lights and the switch works perfectly on them. I connected one of them to 12v and they are nice and bright. The diffusers are great and do a good job of diffusing the light with no lines or shadows. These lights are very light weight, but that is not a concern as I am building my Teardrop as light as possible.If you are after LED lighting, these are also a good choice because you can easily upgrade the bulb to an LED Retrofit from most any Automotive supply store, Amazon, or Ebay. They have the direct replacement LEDs for RVs for most any fixture.You won't go wrong with these lights. This is a quick and easy upgrade from 55 watt lamps to these much brighter 130 watt bulbs. they are wall made and appear to be of higher quality than the Hella lamps that came with my fog lights. 1996 to 1999 Chrysler/Dodge minivan owners have to live with weak headlight configurations. The overburdened single bulb provides both high and low beams in a poorly designed mirror/housing lens.Over years the plastic lens fog/pit from road debris along with the OEM bulbs yellowing.

A bit tough to insert the key into the hole as the towing light outlet on the left is partly in the way.  It's manageable to lock and unlock, but you have to do it at a slight angle and/or wiggle it in.  The black makes it look hidden and matches nice. These KC&#8217;s light up dark & lonely places with brilliant, far reaching, white light even better than I had imagined they would. Install was easy on my &#8217;11 JK using Smittybilt 7690 brackets.

Antenna interference with the passenger side light was avoided by angling the antenna back behind the light. Nice product! I purchased this to secure my motorcycle.  I use it on my 1976 FXE Harley's front rotor.  It works well and secures the front with the lock and visible indication to hopefully make the thief move on to another bike.  The only problem I had with it was I wanted to put it on my rear wheel because that makes it much harder for a thief to take the bike.  My rotor's holes are too small for the pin to fit and the throat barely fit due to my rotor's thickness.  It does however fit well on my front rotor.Bottom line, this is a good, low cost solution to add as one additional layer of theft protection for your motorcycle. 
Of course made in China but OK for the price. Useful to have but don't bank on it if you exceed 5000 pounds (not 10,000 as stated). The receiver tube is of a thinner gauge hence it feels light. The hook feels solid and the inside weld is plentiful. Remember, a chain is as strong as its weakest link.I give three stars because of the price, delivery but not the Quality. OK for light duty use well its an air gauge.  not much to say but this things does its job.  cant imagine start using the pencil gauges again For the price, this is a reliable and accurate gauge. I keep a digital tire gauge in all my cars, and the readings this unit gives is consistent with the others. I have not encountered any challenges re type of rim in using this gauge. Fits fine. 
My last same-sized container anti-seize, standing at attention, lasting me 30 years (home use), so my children will finish this one.About it:It's silver in color, 8-oz. container (a bunch), -65F - 1600F, Anti-Seize, -Corrosion and -Galling; has Lid Brush; label indicates "Made in USA".Specific Use: Ease assembly and disassembly of hardware which experience extreme temperatures and/or corrosive conditions.I've used this routinely, and sparingly for it does not take much - just a light swipe on threads, mating surfaces etc.  Most of my last container went to lubricating boat and boat engine components for very good saltwater corrosion prevention.A general caution is: not apply to business end of sparkplug, O2 sensor etc (lightly on threads/sealing surface only) - else could impact component performance (never seen it happen lol).*UPDATE: I visited Permatex website - wished I'd done so earlier ...

The fact is that the Motorcraft FL820S is the FORD-recommended filter for my 1995 Mercury engine, and is recommended in almost every application of the Ford /Mercury/Lincoln 4.6 Litre engine size.The Motorcraft FL820S interchanges with the BOSCH 3410, the FRAM TG2, and the K&N; 2010.The Motorcraft FL820S  has over 50 pleats, high flow rate, silicone anti-drainback valve, and steel end caps.Amazon's current low price ($3.69) is an excellent value for a quality oil filter that's MADE IN USA !!My car is driven in heavy traffic, desert temperatures, mountain driving, and trans-desert trips from Phoenix to L.A.The standard FORD Motorcraft Filters performed just as well as the high-dollar types -- and filtered MUCH better than the K&N;, which has a very high flow rate (for racing), but the low 90% efficiency rating of the K&N; makes it a no-no for extended oil changes. I wouldn't run a K&N; oil filter for more than 3,000 miles -- you'd just be stirring up dirty oil and pumping it through the bearings !! :>(For my American V-8 engine, I have found the best value to be the Motorcraft FL820S Oil Filter and Mobil 1 5-W-20 Extended Life (Synthetic) engine oil. The quality of the oil filter allows for filter changing every 5,000 miles, and the engine oil is changed once-a-year, regardless of miles driven.For maximum oil life, be sure your PCV system is working properly -- Remove and wash out the PCV Valve with Carburetor  Cleaner, and check for collapsed and/or damaged PCV hoses. A leaking PCV system will suck un-filtered dirt right into your engine !!1995 Mercury Grand Marquis RS225 HP 4.6 Litre SOHC V-8Modified Air Box w/ K&N; Air FilterBosch Impeller Fuel PumpBosch 19 Lb.

The 3rd generation powerprobe includes a number of changes for additional flexibility.  In short, it is a vehicle powered DVM with both a 20 foot cable and an additional 20 foot extension giving you a 40 foot working range around either the battery terminals or cigarette lighter outlet, both clips and a plug are included in the kit.With the series 3 units they use a hard gold plated banana jack to hold the removable probe or cables to extend your reach.  If you purchase the accessory kit, it includes piercing probes that self center on a conductor, pierce the insulation, and attach to the jack allowing you to tap a wire at any point to locate intermittant problems.While the DVM is backlit all the time, it also has 2 bright white LEDs facing forward to aid in finding and probing terminals in dark places.  The actual probe is hardgold plated with a sharp tip and removable at the banana jack.  Another identical probe is included with a screw-in female banana jack in the accessories kit to retrofit the powerprobe I and II units to accept external cables and probes.If you need to excite a circuit with a connection to battery ground or to battery positive, the switch allows a momentary connection to bridge the probe tip to either voltage which is useful in testing relay driven circuits, indicator lights, and other small current loads.  The prope voltage is always displayed during testing on the meter. The voltage/ground switch is circuit breaker protected in case you accidentally drive 12 volts into a chassis ground.  Additionally, since the switch takes abuse it is easily replaced if it fails with just a screwdriver.Combined with the testlead set, the powerprobe 3 greatly simplifies testing of vehicular wire and big rigs up to a single trailer.  The DVM has 5 selectable modes of operation designed for different problems.  Reading the manual is important to get the full value from this meter.Although the price is a little high, the design and construction quality are excellent.  Enough wire is provided to check running lights on trailers or to look for blown fuses.  All of the wiring is exceptionally flexible and heavily insulated with top quality connectors.  Both the tester and accessories come in hard plastic cases that can be stowed in a service box.Not mentioned in specifications is that although the probe runs from 12-24 VDC, the meter can be used to measure voltages up to 80VDC. the ones I received are not identical to the picture.  one can only be installed on the side and the other can only be installed on the front (or back).  the markings are different for left to right level vs front to back level. Easy to replace. It lacks Toyota instructions, but it is exactly like existing Toyota part with all wires colored the same way so it is very obvious how to connect those.The original part has a silicone rubber tube going all the way from top to bottom with wires running inside it. This part only provides a short length of tubing that, at best, would cover half of the length of wires on my car.I thing they should provide a &#34;telescoping&#34; tubing of two diameters with one going inside of the other while you are crimping wires and then extended to cover the full length of wires 
Put full weight of my fifth wheel them with no problem, but you need two if you have a double axle. Lay them both down in the same direction and pull the trailer completely over the first one and onto the second. Be sue they are spaced the same distance as the wheel axles. Need 2 for each side, works well for small pop up. Buy these over ones w/ rope and add your own rope, same choke. These already have the hole for rope. Dimensions given are inaccurate on these two, they are exactly the same size. I have an army 6x6, 6 wheel nuts per wheel...each two piece wheel bolted together with 15 nuts at 400 ft/lbs.  A couple wheels had some air leaks, and they need to be disassembled.  It would have been a bear to remove these nuts without the ant-seize.  I use this on every bolt in every application.  Big bolts, little bolts and it does a great job of protecting threads that are exposed to weather. 
put them on a 2011 jeep wrangler .These look great and go on with ease. If your are looking for taillight guards these are the ones to get. Btw the screws are the same length but a different diameter so follow instructions. I can see again!!! They are weighted nicely and are well made. Install was easy and typical and the price was fair for the product. Make certain to order 2 as they are not in pairs. Happy driving stay dry. These are great.  In my first manual tire change I used these and I'm thankfull I have them.  They are very strong, easy to use and grip.  The size and shape was perfect.  Overall pretty basic and not much more to say other than if you need tire spoons, these are a very good deal -- you won't go wrong.  Highly recommend these. 
The size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous. The funnel is 10" long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6" long. It states that the funnel is 4" x 4" but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2-1/4" in diameter at the widest point.It would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless. The Tender Jr. does not come with a cigarette adapter so I cut this in half to make two. I purchased 2 lighter plugs for a buck each from China&#8230; with free shipping&#8230; and they are working fine. These aren&#8217;t an exact match with the Tender cables but they fit together OK and are easy to determine polarity with the wire colors. You can also just use this as an extension cord for your Tender. The description states a length of 12-inches&#8230; but it&#8217;s actually 14-inches tip-to-tip on the connectors. Nice item for the price and it&#8217;s made in Mexico. Not much to say here except it is a plastic funnel about 5 inches in diameter with a long and flexible, see-through, plastic hose.  In my opinion this is a must have item for the vehicle trunk or truck tool box and this is one of acceptable quality and function. 
This air gauge is dead on accurate, it seals completely, allows air to flow the way it should and the two headed chuck fit all cars, trucks and even those pesky hard to reach motorcycle valve stems. I own three motorcycles and there is nothing more aggravating than trying to fit a chuck in between rotors, fork tubes and tight spaces on a motorcycle. You know what I mean. This two headed angled chuck is angled perfectly to fit over a cycle stem without leaking or having to bend the valve stem. I love it. This tool is perfect for solo bleeding brakes. All you do is attach it to a bottle/jar/container via some adapters and tubing and then bleed away without the fear of getting air back into the brake lines.The only tiny problem is that the tubing attached to the bleeder screw is a air tight one way check valve so when you take it off a large amount of brake fluid is trapped on the intake side of the tube and if your not careful may make quite a mess on the calipher. I wish they included some button on the tool to open the check valve fully to allow the excess fluid trapped in the tubing to flow downward into the container to minimize the chances to make a mess. Great feeler gauge!Equip it in Corrosion-X, or WD40 for long lasting.Great to measure spark plug gaps, for performing valve adjustments (valve gap), etc... 
I love K&N filters.  I use them in all my cars. As soon as I buy a car I replace the filter with a K&N. Just buy a cleaner kit and clean as needed. Never will need replacing. Do not over oil the filter once you clean it and let it dry before reinstalling filter. If you over oil the filter, the oil can get into intake manifold and build up dirt. Run this in a daily driver to make it last longer (I use 8 or even 10-12 oz in my 2005 Lincoln Town Car at each fill-up) and overall smoother engine response.Run it in an older car or dirtier engine to clean out a lot of old deposits (the bad deposits, not the varnish that HELPS lubricatethe engine).  Might see a small increase in MPG in that scenario.Here's a helpful tip: as the instructions indicate, you may replace up to 20% of your motor oil with this.I ran a quart of it in the Lincoln with new (but cheap) 5W-20 motor oil and a cheap filter (the Fram Orange Can of Death ExtraGuard isfine for this purpose) for 2 weeks and then changed the oil & filter back to the really good Motorcraft FL-820S and synthetic oilI normally used.  I say that's just as useful as a SeaFoam treatment or any of the so-called engine"flush" treatments, whichmost cars don't need unless they've been mistreated for years.  Worked well in my car which as as smooth-running as one couldhope for at about 114,000 miles and 8 years old.  Look inside under the oil fill cap and everything shines nicely.And as always use 4 oz per 10 gallons (or so, I actually use a bit more but that's just me talking) in the fuel at every fill up -- addit BEFORE filling up for best possible mixing.  But after is all right as well, better then than never. This really helps but isn't perfect. I have used this for washing my car. Since a low flow rate is best for efficiency, I use a pressure washer. My pressure washer is rated at 1.8 gallons per minute. That flow rate is below the recommended maximum rate easily. I definitely wipe the Windows. If I don't dry my car it does have some spots. I might not be getting all the soap off, but I do think it's the filter. Here's a tip for you. When your first filter starts to show signs of inefficiency, screw your next filter into it but in 2nd place. Even if your older filter is only getting half of the minerals, that's half of as much going into the fresh filter. When you eventually start to see more spots than the norm, take the oldest filter off and add your new filter after the flow of the filter that's been there. I hope you got my explanation. Happy car washing! 
Does what it says it does......looks great ! These item does fit perfect on my 2004 BMW x3. does what its suppose to do. so far so good thanks It does exactly what it's supposed to do. No problems whatsoever. 
Fits perfectly for my 2003 Toyota Camry, but the number of folds in the filter were fewer than the OEM one. It's short 10 folds compared to the Toyota OEM cabin air filter. These item does fit perfect on my 2004 BMW x3. does what its suppose to do. so far so good thanks Exactly what was offered, fit nicely, no major prep work, won't fade or crack, adjusts perfectly, easy removal and fits under seat in truck 
Does what it says it does......looks great ! It does just what it needs to do. It keeps my trailer from taking off down the road and wrecking everything in its path. This product is a must have for anyone driving. Not only does it make it safer for highway driving. Especially when occasionally rain drops are the beyond normal and make it difficult and unsafe to drive.One tip this product works well on highway driving during city however it does work but not as well. During highway driving you can actually see the rain "peel away" from your windshield. WOOOSH!!! 
First, you will need to buy the high tone also, or it will sound stupid. It is part #72102. I have put these pair on my last 4 cars. The low tone does have a habit of failing if it gets wet. This has happened twice to me. For some reason, the high tone works fine if it gets wet. Make sure you mount the low tone in a location where it will not get wet.The kit does not include a relay. You may want to install a relay, especially if your car is wired for one horn. The horns draw 4.5A each at 12V. This is usually within factory limits and most fuseboxes will have a 10A or larger relay built in the horn circuit. The kit does include 3 female blade connectors, a mounting bracket and nut, and a jumper wire (needed if your car is wired with one horn lead).And, they are very loud. Packaging declares 130db at 4 inches. I do not have a db meter, but I can assure you the horns will get the job done. The pair has a nice tone, and will rid your car of the little factory &#34;meep meep&#34; horns. Consider this...  The combine cost of your tow vehicle and trailer...  The combine weight of your tow vehicle and trailer...  The fact that your trailer may well weigh more than your tow vehicle...  And that moron that just jumped in your lane then slammed on his brakes...  This is NOT the time to think to yourself, "maybe I should've gotten a better brake controller."  Seriously, when the difference in cost is under $100, is it really not worth buying the best?I've used the Tekonsha P3 for two and half years now and I have nothing but praises to sing!  Features, user friendliness, and results!  This unit has it all.  First lets talk about the mechanism.  It uses a digital G-Sensor as apposed to a physical pendulem.  Why is this a benifit?  Because there are no downhill issues that you see with the physical and analog type sensors.  Prior to digial sensors, the downhill slope would throw off the pendulem and the brake controller either would send a weaker current to the brakes or none at all.  Some people have questioned the reliablity of digital sensors.  But with more than 10 years of full production digital units, complaints are actaully less than the older analog units.  Consider this as well, the sensor is not only quicker but more accurate as well, hard to soft braking is much safer now.  How does it work?  Just like any other accelerometor...it senses the volume deceleration and then computes an appropriate voltage and current to send to the trailer brakes based on a percentage of the user's max output setting.Let's talk interface.  A four button face with a roughly 1.5" LCD display plus a belly mounted manual switch.  With no brakes connected, this unit will dispay the default "Tekonsha Screen".  Once brakes are connected via the trailer plug, the unit will display the "Tow Screen".  It has a large two/three read out that displays 0.0 as a default.  While sitting still and once brake pressure is applied it will jump to approximately 10% of the max set output, after 3 seconds of being stationary it will move up to 25% power.  This is designed to "hold" the trailer if stopped on an incline or decline.  Setting the max brake power is a snap with the two "Up" and "Down" buttons on the left side of the face.  The value moves up and down by 0.1 increments and quite quickly if you hold the button down.  The last two buttons are "boost" and "page" which I will discuss when I talk features.  The last button is the manual brake override.  This bottom mounted spring loaded slider switch will manually add braking power to the trailer brakes (up to the user set max) even without depressing the vehicles brake peddle.  This is a standard feature on all brake contorllers, but I wanted anyone looking for their first brake controller to understand what this was.  Lastly, is the warning screen.  It's a deep red screen with a trailer and a "no" sign.  This indicates that the controller which had previously sensed brakes connected no longer can sense them.  Generally an indication of a poor trailer connection at the wiring harness or a problem with the brakes themsleves.Let's talk features.  I've mentioned the "Boost" button, but what is it?  There are 4 levels of boost for trailer brakes.  Off, LV. 1, LV. 2, & LV. 3.  Boost adds a brief (fraction of a second) burst to the trailer brakes which slows the trailer slightly more than the normal pressure would and keeps it from bumping or pushing the tow vehicle when brake pressure is initailly applied.  Very important if as many are these days, your trailer weighs more than your tow vehicle.  After the burst it returns the voltage and current to the G-sensors reccomended output.  There isn't a real scientific method for figuring what you need to use.  The picture on the home screen shows LV1 as small trailer, 2 as a med tailer, and 3 as a large trailer.  My trailer is a 6K lb. TT and I just leave it on the default LV. 1 boost.  Everytime the units is powered it returned to the default LV. 1.  The unit will power down after 15 mins with no trailer connected AND no input from the brake signal wire.  The "Page" button will take you to a second screen that you navigate with the "up", "down", and "Boost" (now "enter") buttons.  This sceen has some cool features as some useful features.  "Backlight" allows you to brighten or dim the brightness of the display.  "Color" lets you set the color of the display.  (Yeah I know, unessesary, but cool)  The default color is "White" which is more of a light blue.  There's also Magenta, Orange, Dk Blue, Violet, Lt. Green, and Dk. Green.  Red is not availible as it's reserved as a warning color for the "no trailer connection" warning screen.  Back to the page screen.  There's also a VERY USEFUL troubleshooting screen.  It lets you view diagnostics on the fly and over the road that can give you four digit readouts of battery voltage, stoplight (brake input signal) voltage, brake voltage, and brake current.  This screen alone is worth the cost of this brake controller!  When you first connect your tailer do some tests and record the max input you set, the output under normal braking conditions, as well as the brake voltage and amperage.  If down the line you get the feeling the brakes aren't working properly, you can re-run this test and see if it's an electrical problem or not.  Finally when your done, pressing the page button will return you to the "tow screen."Installation.  A snap for anyone that has a factory tow package.  Tekonsha offers plug and play wiring harnesses that plug into most make and model years of trucks.  If you have to have it installed or choose to install it yourself as I did, it can be challenging.  But it's a simple four wire hookup.  A 12V input from the battery (running thru a 30A auto reset breaker NOT a fuse), an output to the brake pin of your 6 or 7-way trailer connector, a stoplight input running to your vehicle's stoplight switch behind the brake peddle, and lastly a frame ground.  The mount can be a little challenging to install because of the akward access to the screws, but it can be mounted at nearly any angle other than strait up or down and provided the face is facing a close to directly rearward as possible.All in all, this is probably the most important review I've ever done.  This controller will save you grief and keep you and your vehicle safe.  Make sure for your safety, your families safety, and the safety of all those on the road you buy the brake controller that does it's job the best.  Buy the Tekonsha P3. The Accutire MS-4350B will measure pressure in increments of 0.5 PSI (BAR units can be also selected), beep when the reading was successful and show it on a large, blue backlit display. Optionally it's possible to program your own goals with separate pressure levels for the front and back tires, in which case you will see both the reading and the goal.For comfort, it comes with a rubberized grip.A one-LED placed under the pressure-reading tip can be used as a flashlight if needed.The 5-year warranty statement promises to replace the unit if defective for as long as the owner pays for shipping both ways. Since this is likely to cost more than the price of purchase, the warranty promise is meaningless in practice.Specs:- Range: 5-99 PSI (BAR units supported)- Resolution: 0.5 PSI- Power: 2 replaceable CR2032 Lithium batteries- Manufacturer: Made in ChinaI found the gauge easy to use and the measurements appear to be accurate. I had no difficulty taking readings. Taking a reading can be as easy as pushing the nozzle against the tire's valve and waiting for the beep, then disengaging the gauge and reading the display. Yes, a little air does escape but my unit was always able to make a good seal in a fraction of a second. For those who don't wish to remember the recommended pressure, the gauge can be programmed to store settings for the rear and front tires or, you could store settings for 2 cars if the recommended pressure happens to be the same for both front and rear. I can't think of a practical use for the 'flashlight' feature - it stays on only while the power button is pressed - but there may come a day I will be grateful it was there.I find this gage to perform well and, so far, I was able to operate it without any trouble. I understand that it's possible to perform the exact same readings with a near-free 'analog' gauge but I believe that the added precision and convenience are worth this item's price. However, I will take out one star and rate this gauge as a 4-star mainly for the somewhat misleading '5-year warranty' claim, prominently displayed on the packaging. Given that 'in real life' the customer would pay more for shipping back and forth than it would cost to purchase a brand-new unit the warranty promise, whether 5-year or double-lifetime as quite meaningless. 
Perfect for exhaust work.  I bought it for a catalytic converter and o2 sensor project because it is rated for: -30F to 1800F Fits my John Deere Lawn tractor which is model LA120 and likely it fits all the L, LA and D series lower-end John Deere tractors. PLease post a comment if it does not and I'll update this reviewCurrently Amazon says it does not fit my third generation Miata (NC2) but it doesThese filters come top in most online filter tests and I use them in almost all my cars Works great, nice to have a second cable, but the OBD end of the cable is angled.  In my case, this cable won't work on my Subaru Outback.  I would prefer the option of a straight OBD connector.  Note that the angle connector works on my other four cars (Mazda, Honda, Dodge). 
Works just like it needs to. Perfect fit for the tailgate on my 96 chevy 1500 when the oem clip busted. They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods. Bought this for work... do a lot of Toyota, scion, lexus oil filters... works good. nice tight fit and hasent stripped anything yet... 
Loaded with features, including discrete settings for Optima style AGM batteries, and an automatic de-sulfating charge step, a great value for the money. I used this controller to replace the horrible factory dodge controller in my 2010 ram 2500. This controller is worlds ahead of the factory controller in terms of features and available settings. If you are hauling a large trailer it is a must have. The boost function is a great feature that applies the trailer brakes ahead of the truck brakes. You can set boost to 3 levels to meet your desired brake feel. My fiver weighs around 2500lbs more than my truck and between this controller and the exhaust brake stopping is effortless. I purchased this charger because I termed it 'smart' because of all of the different charging modes it employs.  The deciding factor for this particular model is that it has the constant voltage that you can use when you disconnect the battery to clean the terminals or change the battery.  More important to me than the radio presets are the engine control module settings.  It's nice not having to wait for the computer to relearn the particular variations of settings from the default ones. 
Bought this because I wanted to measure the length of a specific body part of mine.  Unfortunately a ruler was too big to measure the length of it.  I needed something very small in order to figure out how long it is. With my new wheels I needed a tire iron to be able to reach how deep my bolts are in the wheel now.  This tool came with everything I needed.  It covers both size deep well sockets and an extension.  The telescopic handle is great for space saving to store in the truck.  It is also nice that it will fit standard sockets and is not just once size socket for the whole tool.I gave it 4 stars because I certainly trust the tool for an emergency but don't think it would make a great tool to use day in and day out.  Hopefully that make sense.  Also the bag that comes with it is thin flimsy plastic.  I didn't even bother with the bag. This would be a great idea if it actually wasn't too tall to fit inside our camper cabinets.  I measured this before ordering and thought it would fit.  But you really can't judge how your knives will fit in it from the description.  Most of our knives were too thick at the handle or too wide at the blade to sit down inside it fully.  Therefore they would stick up too high and would prevent the cabinet door from closing.  It was a waste and I didn't use it.I recommend instead buying a full knife set with holder and overall product dimensions, and doing some thoughtful measuring. 
Fits well into the 7 pin socket and holds the 4 pin socket securely.  Works just like it's supposed to.  Nice adapter The pin (10mm) is too wide for the disc brake holes and the disk is too wide for the lock to easily slip on and off without damaging the dick bake itself. Great lock for other bikes I suspect, but not designed for thick brake disks with smaller holes. Used this to replace front coil springs on my JK.....Worked well very heavy built. The safety pins are a must have. 
I love the simplicity and reliability of this unit. It comes with 4 alligator clips and 4 O ring clips to hardwire to something like my atv. I hardwired the connector to the quad so all i need to do it connect and disconnect the quick connect clips. These things are awesome.  I bought two along with some relays and relay sockets so I could get them enough power directly from the battery to do serious audible damage.  Make sure to buy this one with its mate, the 72102 high tone.  After wiring in the relays, these went in my 2000 Civic perfectly.  They replaced the crappy horn in there, and I used the wiring to tie into the relay signal hot wire.  Then, I grounded the relay to the body by tying it into the ground wire from one of the horns.  The horns come with these little wire slide connectors that you can clamp onto your wires.  I used wire nuts to tie all the wires together - I suggest you do the same.  I was able to mount them facing away from eachother with grounding connectors in between the mounts using a single bolt that held the old Honda horn.  This was ideal, and very clean - no drilling required!I suggest finding yourself a 12V DC 4-pin or 5-pin 40 Amp SPST ISO Micro Relay for this project.  Also, it really helps to have a 5-Pin Wire Harness Relay Socket.  This will give you all the wires you need directly from the relay.  These are really cheap items, and you shouldn't have trouble finding them.  The 4-pin relays work fine with the 5-pin sockets.  Then, educate yourself on how relays work, and wire that bad boy up!  I got my relay and relay socket on ebay.Overall, I'm very pleased with this product.  Buy it now if you want to be heard on the highway. These things are awesome.
