the tent is made of two parts assembled with a zipper that fit around a structure made of flimsy hollow plastic rods . the problem lies in the structure which is not strong enough to withstand the weight of an average cat . if your cat likes exploring and climbing on top of things like most cats do the frame will break quickly .if you re minimally handy you can very easily make yourself a much better structure using pvc piping and joints they re inexpensive and can be found in the plumbing section of any hardware store . if your cat is heavy and a climber i would strongly suggest not even bothering with the supplied frame and building your own right away .another irritating problem is that replacing the waste receptacles is extremely inconvenient when the littermaid is in the tent .all in all unless you absolutely have to hide the littermaid this tent is poorly designed and more trouble than it s worth .my two small lb dachshund s are very agressive walkers ! constantly pulling against any leash or type of leash . cheap fabric or poor manufacturing just doesn t last long with my two . as such i ve had bad experiences especially with retractables leashes . this is a well manufactured leash ! you can feel that when you hold it . it weighs more than others i ve used and has a lock and release button separate from the brake button . nice feature ! also has a good set of instructions as to why you should use the included safety collar . since i bought the big dog size i expect it will wear extremely well ! !bought this for my pet spoodle mths ago when he was under a year old and an avid puller . he is now fully grown at kgs and i find this product the best fit for him . being at the lower end of the weight band i feel secure using this on him . older he has since stopped pulling but it is good to know there is added security . i would tend oversize to ensure a healthy safety margin rather than buy him a small with him on upper end of the weight band and risk him breaking the leash . i chose the tape over the thinner rope as i perceive this as being of a more robust construction .dog hand size small to mediummatt black hides dirt easy to clean being plastic casing is washable .lock mechanism is robust and reliableretracting mechanism works smoothly everytime flat tape is better than ropeergonomically designed i find the handle and button positionings are spot on for easy operation suited for the small to medium hand there are other more fancy designs available to suit your tastes but the fundamental design is flawless . have dropped this times but it is still working perfectly . it does scratch however being matt black is not noticeable until scrutinized . will provide update on longevity as we go .my dog loves this leash as a pup i can let him explore with confidence of a controlled recall without the risk of choking him with a rigid chain . now he largely walks with me leash free . you get what you pay for . this model is well worth it and not overly expensive unlike it s colourful glossy patterned counterparts . buy quality you won t be disappointed .
bought the official refill ink cartridges for our epson printer . they work as they are supposed to .this cartridge last longer than the standard cartridge . it works well with my canon mp all in one printer .great toner for my work printer .
i found myself in the need of a competent scale to accurately measure items so i can sell them on . . . well let s just say it rhymes with rebay . i come from a generation when scales had springs in them so i was kind of leery about a scale that i could weigh an ounce and also several dozen pounds . i said that must be one heck of a spring . well scales don t use springs anymore i guess they use some sort of measurement from the flex of dissimilar metals or what have you . anyway this scale measures in pounds pounds and ounces ounces grams and kilograms . it makes it really easy to accurately weigh items to sell on . . . well you know . one great feature about this scale is that the front panel can be removed and pulled towards you on a coiled cord so that you can see the measurement of large boxes . i ve needed that option occasionally . most of the things i weigh are less than five pounds but i got the pound scale in case i needed that capability such as to weigh our cat or something . not that i have a lb cat but if i wanted to weigh something substantial at least i have that capability . bottom line if you re looking for a scale to help you weigh things to sell on blah blah bay look no further than this fine product .i chose this because of the price . i needed a postage scale . it is nice because it weighs up to lbs and down to ounces . mine came with the ac adapter . you will want one because it uses c batteries which are expensive . the detachable face is handy because large packages would make it impossible to see the weight . it seemed easy to read and consistent .the problemthe weight is heavy by about or . that can mean a lot of excess charges when you print your own shipping labels relying in this scale . if you never checked you will never know . weigh a lb bag of flour and see . once you know then you can do the math every time you ship something . it can be calibrated which requires a kg weight or lbs . oz in the usa . the instructions suggest that you calibrate it before sending in for service or warranty . i will report back when i find a weight combination and try calibration . once calibrated it could be a very nice scale for the money . not before though .this is exactly what i wanted an accurate scale that has the capacity to weigh any package i m ever likely to ship anywhere but is sensitive enought to weigh a single letter so i can penny pinch on postage . it s compact readible accurate and dare i say fun to use . finally the price it right ! who could ask for more ?
i love this guitar and one can not go wrong with a yamaha i currently have acoustical yamaha guitars . the fg s is a full size dreadnought style steel string guitar . i usually do not like full size guitars as they do not fit in my lap well but this one is perfect for me and i can reach the full length of the neck with no problems . it has a deep tone and good volume . i give stars to this guitar and recommend for the beginner as well as seasoned player .i acquired this recently i did not need another strat style or copy of but it s white . . . .just gotta love that vibe ? anyhow lots of reviews justifiably good here s a few add ons in case . . . it s routed hsh under the hood but looks tight . . think it s bucker size upgradable top and bottom didn t measure i like single coils . . .the white is a poly finish love poly durable and crack fade resist and exquisite nicely done alder body but it s hefty alder like lb or so . not so keen on headstock shape but the neck is nice too nice to change like i was thinking till i got it . . . nice quality control on these really smooth rosewood board with med jumbo that s what i call anyway frets good fretting . standard hardware indicative of price but decent and well installed no missed screw holes etc . was set up with standard action etc out of box was clean set up no buzz or uneven saddle stuff etc . great fit and finish best i can tell its a standard f type plate if interested looks to be easy changer .overall it s a solid piece assembled well for me the body and neck is what seals the deal better then most out there this range . . . it is alder and hefty but durable . i look to change most hardware in time so won t comment on that what s there . . . is installed well . . . things i forgot tuners wanna say ? mm standard import style . . . seem good not legendary and tremelo whammy standard zinc block there s the must upgrade part . . . it s standard . string space import i got one pet peave it s steel or brass blocks . . . a shame all these guitars nowadays with the zinc thin low sustain blocks my advice get a fender mim standard lefty trem the whole thing with steel saddles and all maybe best money ever spent . . . i can t afford the gotoh or callahan stuff on this a standard mim import space fender with steel block and saddles is easy direct replacement and with the hefty alder you ll get tons of sustain and tone and keep tuned way better . also the neck i say nice but i mean it s nicer than most in the shape it s slightly chunky c shape ? not baseball bat chunky but you feel it on frets it s beefier ? i have avg . size hands i find it s a good fit .in all . . . if your looking in this price range it s nice and upgradable as you can or learn more .i used this on the side of a wooden bookshelf for my ukulele . it s attractive . it s well made . it s fork is a tad large for the ukulele it has rubber o rings that slide so i can bring them in and the uke does fit then . but then even the three inch deep uke is close to the bookcase or wall if you use it there . the uke hits when i put it in the hanger so i put a felt pad where the uke body hits the bookcase .many uke players simply nail a single nail in the wall and use a loop off string from it around the uke head and tuners . this is much less expensive holds very well is even more low profile than this hanger and never drops a uke . consider it for your needs .i d not buy another of these for a ukulele . it likely works fine for a guitar though .i deducted one point for the fact that even though it s adjustable the o rings and advertised for ukes it doesn t work well for them . and it s heavy and not stylish in my opinion . i have the hercules wall hanger mechanical gripper for my electric guitars and it s fabulous for guitars overkill for lightweight ukuleles maybe .hercules stands wallmount guitar hanger gsp wbupdate the more i use it the less i like it . i find that friction tuner ukuleles do not fit on it well at all and the tuners hit the fork and it can make your uke out of tune . so for small instruments you d have to try it yourself with mandolins and banjos this is atrocious . for guitars it s not as good as hercules .
works just like it needs to . perfect fit for the tailgate on my chevy when the oem clip busted .they do work . exactly as advertised . hane no fear on buying these . fit the chevy silverado wt tailgate rods .i purchased this to be able to attach a high end hydraulic assisted bike rake on the back of my jeeps jks with the rear tire still on . it fit perfectly and teamed with the bolt lock blt receiver lock keyed specifically for your line of vehicle it can be kept in the jeep and my daughter doesn t need anything but her car key .the extender is exactly as advertised well made fit perfectly and does eactly what it is inteded for .
epson makes great printer papers . i use epson s matte paper almost as much as the regular inkjet paper . this paper is made for color presentation and graphic . i print out my portfolio and sample work with matte paper because it is relatively cheap to the high quality printout . i use the epson and the color print matches the monitor colors almost perfect .for photo prints it is fine but photos are simultaneous with glossy texture . if you like glossy photo then this is not the photo paper you would get . the colors do not jump at you nor have sharp deferential qualities that glossy can produce . printing plain texts without color might be too wasteful costly for matte paper . i considered epson the best in paper qualities over canon hp kodak and others for the quality price . i have switched to the canon i and am still using epson s paper . it is that versatile . i tend to use the harder to find epson double side matte paper .the resolution and color with this full size x printer is excellent . you can adjust the quality and print on all types of paper . hp brand name used with my hp photo printer colors seem to really take to this paper . it s totally different than just printing photos on computer paper sheets at this price is more than fair considering i don t use this paper that often remember when printing photos ink will be more expensive than the paper it goes quick on high quality settings quality photos when printed !
this one has been running in a and is doing such a good job i bought another for my gallon . the one bad thing i will say about it is that the default foam insert does not do the greatest job with small particles . it s great at removing really big stuff but there is definitely particle matter that makes it through the filter .the good news is you can put any damn thing you want into this filter and you ll be fine . functionally this is a canister filter . you can add or remove any filter media you want you can even take out all the default stuff and fill the whole thing with cotton batting it will still work . it s also very quiet . if you keep the water level high enough in your tank the water pouring out of the filter will not make loud sloshing noises . the motor makes almost no noise i can t hear it over the sound of my bubbler . if you unplug it for a water change it will make the usual grinding noises until you refill it . the important thing is to make sure the intake tube is firmly set and the area around the tube is where you pour the water when you refill it . pouring water over the filter media will not prime the pump and you will get grinding .in short quiet works .this prefilter fits to any aquaclear filter you can get . it s very helpful so that you don t really have to unplug your filter since only really tiny tidbits can get through the pores to get into the filter . i recommend rinsing it in some of your leftover water from a water change to keep it fresh to keep the bacteria in . if this is for a new filter leave it in for a month to get all the bacteria you need on it and if you want it says that as long as it s been in a tank for months you can put it in a new tank to a new filter to establish it immediately .i wanted this for my gallon breeder however it looks like it is putting out to many fine bubbles so i had to tone it down with a control valve . i didn t want the parts of my aquarium covered in aquarium scale too quickly . if you purchase this make sure you get a control valve and a check valve .also make sure you have a big enough air pump to run the thing . should get air pump big enough at least for gallon tankgreat product ! ! !

the gate does not swing back does not close by itself and only the bottom lock worksas with everything about being a parent locks are more complicated than you d have thought or would like ! screw mounted magnetic locks the safety st tot lok locks can be difficult to install especially on drawers but have more flexibility about where you can install the lock than the adhesive locks and seem very secure . still most people may want to try the adhesive locks see below first to make it easier to get some child proofing done quickly .pros very nice secure once installed especially since the fit can be adjusted to give a tight lock when closed . works vertically or horizontally . . . that is on the side of a door or the top . can easily be switched to hold the lock open for when no children are aroundcons complicated to install especially in some situations . so you might not get around to installing them given all the other demands on your time . requires drilling a hole partway through the cabinet door from the inside for the magnetic part plus some small holes to attach may require some new tools a collar lock to keep from drilling through the door and a right angle chuck for tight spacesif you plan to be in your home for a while and want a finished secure set of locks the tot loks may be a good choice .one note if you use them often the magnetic key will wear the finish where it rubs .adhesive mount magnetic locks the kidco adhesive mount magnet locks will only work in some spots but it s still a good lock to try first for a lot of people because it works well in the right situations and is easy to install . buy some and see how they work on your cabinets . once you ve tried a few it s a lot easier to see where ll they ll work or won t work .pros quick to install after a few minutes of figuring it out no drilling required so less work and no damage to furniture or cabinetscons only installs horizontally along the top edge of a door or drawer given the way they use gravity to lock .we just use the adhesive mount no additional screws for some furniture we didn t want to drill holes into . they seem to be strong enough so far especially since our kids seem to give up trying a door after a while if it won t open they lose interest . i don t know how the adhesive would stand up to long term use or really heavy pulling .hook locks the advantage that either of the magnetic locks has over the old fashioned hook type like themommy s helper safe lok cabinet door and drawer lock is that the hooks have a lot more play they have to open a little bit to give you access to the lock . so a child can bang them back and forth they might not open the door or drawer but they will make a racket . maybe ok in some situations but not a great solution for easily accessible drawers or doors .slide locks slide locks such as theamerican red cross cabinet safety slide lock are very quick and easy to install if they fit . but they can also be pretty easy for some kids to unlock so if they are within reach they aren t much of a barrier to older kids . and even younger kids can sometimes open them by pulling or pushing on the doors . however they are a good temporary solution and can be useful to carry when you travel .flex locks flex locks like the safety first cabinet flex lock see reviews orcabinet flex lock pack are strong and easy to install and you can see by looking at them whether the lock is secure unlike the magnetic locks which are designed to be out of sight . so you might want to use them for critical spots such as under the sink or use them when you travel . and as a bonus they are so secure that even some adults can t open them ! they do take two hands to open . not attractive but they do the job if you keep them tightened .this device keeps the oven shut despite my toddler hanging off the oven handle fortunately phew ! . i tried a different lock prior to this one which i returned as the lock kept flopping down inside the oven whenever open . this one does not have that problem . it is easy to install and works in areas with tight clearance too .
i have owned brother printers forever . i currently have four brother lazer printers and use this toner exclusively . have always been satisfied with print quality and with life of toner .the brother laser printer has served me well since . when print quality indicates i buy a new toner cartridge and receive the effect of a new printer . installation is as easy as adding paper and the genuine brother cartridge fits and functions perfectly .the ink cartridge is o .k . but the epson r printer is a huge ink hog . the epson printer s that use this cartridge should all be recalled .
how do you rate these ? they do exactly what they are supposed to do . what more can i say . it don t stink no more ? ! loli have used this solvent a number of times to remove adhesive and badging from my cars . for that it works wonderfully . when used modestly it does not effect automotive surfaces or glass . since this stuff is so potent i would recommend using the the spray straw in the nozzle so that you can more carefully target where you spray this stuff . you want to be very careful where you put it . it also evaporates rapidly so you need to work quickly when you use it .just to reinforce a few precautions do not get this on plastic it will discolor it or any soft organic materials . do not use around high eat as it is extremely flammable limit all bodily exposureoverall this is a wonderful product just be very careful how you use it .i was suprised how well and how easy they worked even on an extended van . it saves wear and tear on the shoulders .
bought of these to replace an old rusty set that was on my older camper . i like the lug nuts on the end much better than the old style . i was able to swap mine out by just removing the bolts and the old jacks and bolting this in the exact same place no drilling was needed as the holes lined up perfectly for me .i love these entry guards they gave my jeep tj a renovated look at the entries they were ware and scratched now thy look like new . easy to install and not problem closing the doors . jeep wrangler sportit took longer to find the tools and unpackage the guards than it tookto install them on the jeep . a couple of screws and with in five minutesi was back in business . they look great and might stop a limb from bustingthe tail light . might .
does not work for all guitars . one of my guitars has a more rounded head and it does not fit over that anyway i have tried . though with the arrow shaped holders it works as it shouldi purchased this case for my newline pod hd . it s a well built solid case for the price . it fits the hd very snugly and has large pocket on the front for cables . i wouldn t drop my pod in this thing but as a basic light duty carrying case it does the job very well .there seems to be a lot of know it alls when it comes to this case . one reviewer says it s made by fender . i seriously doubt that and have to wonder on what he bases that on . show me proof . someone else seems to think it s made by epiphone . sorry to disappoint you but epiphone doesn t make cases . they accept bids from case manufacturers who can build a case to thier specifications at the lowest cost . i have several epiphone dots and a gibson es . i bought epiphone cases for all of them . i found the gibson case to be identical except for the color of the lining and the logo on the outside of the case . i couldn t see any sense in paying more money just for the gibson name . my gibson fits perfectly in the epiphone case . although the cases have the epiphone logo on the outside they are all made by tkl . how do i know that you re wondering ? they have a tkl tag on the inside of the accessory compartment . that s been a few years ago . the cases you get now could be made by a different company . the case is very heavy and is actually heavier than the guitar . regardless of who actually makes the case it has to meet epiphone s manufacturing standards so it s got to be good . this case will fit the dot casino sheraton and the gibson es . anyone who knows anything about guitars knows that the epiphone joe pass emperor ii has a much thicker body than the dot . this case was not intended for the emperor ii . it s a great case and will protect your guitar but it s not designed to be thrown from a rooftop or run over by a car . i just bought two more of these cases for my harmony rockets . one is a single cutaway reissue and the other is a vintage double cutaway . both guitars fit perfectly .
it is so nice to be able to pick up an inexpensive base and use the same seat in two different cars . i would recommend this highly to anyone with the graco snugride travel system .i have to say that i want to thank graco for thinking of the parents ! ! !this is probably the most innovative invention that anyone could have made . i love the fact that we don t have to move the base from car to car every time we change cars . this also saves us from having to buy a second seat for convenience .also i love that i can just unlatch the carseat from the base and carry her inside in the seat . it keeps the seat from getting cold in the winter time since you can take it inside with you !everyone should have one ! ! !some thoughtful friends sent us a bundle me when our son was born . when initially shopping for baby items i hadn t thought we d need such a thing but it was incredibly useful . the bottom half stays in the car seat making it warm and snuggly and the top half zips on . we left it zipped on all the time for convenience and just varied the degree to which we zipped our son in depending on the temperature . you can keep it zipped all the way for travel to the car and easily unzip a bit for ventilation when riding in a warm vehicle . no need for a bulky snowsuit or blankets just throw on a hat and when you reach your destination baby can be unzipped in a second and is comfortably dressed for indoor temperatures . the straps of our carseat fit through the holes perfectly . if you re concerned about this i would head into brs and simply ask a salesperson to demonstrate the product with your carseat . also important the bundle me washes quite well . only downside to this product for me and it s a minor point is that i sometimes preferred carrying my son in a snugli while running certain errands . when we got out of the car i would put on the snugli and load baby in but then needed to wrap up with warm blankets for the walk into the building since he was only wearing indoor clothes . not a concern when you re bringing the carseat infant carrier inside which was most often the case for us .as for safety concerns i was willing to accept the information below from the product description . and where the well being of my child is concerned i was comforted to know that the bundle me prevented his catching a chill throughout our cold new england winter . in line with jj cole s commitment to child safety the bundle me has been tested to fmvss federal motor vehicle safety standard requirements . all tests passed on the child restraint system indicating that the bundle me product appeared to have little to no effect on the performance of the child restraint system . 
great case for my epiphone sheraton ii ! if you own a dot sheraton or a you should buy this case ! it comes with a key so you can lock it .this guitar stand does not find hidden treasure . it does not hypnotize beautiful women . it does not fix your transmission . it does not tell your boss to give you a raise .it just holds onto your guitar when you don t see any reason to put into a case . it s sturdy reliable and to the point . no gimmicks nothing flashy . just a guitar stand that is reasonably priced . if you need one might as well be this one .great little piece of leather . does what i want it to do and does not hurt my guitar . thank you
this hands free gate works when you step down on the foot paddle which causes a latch to open . you can then push the gate open with a hand or a knee . the gate is fairly easy to install a necessary slim wrench is included in the box and requires no screws or glue . the gate provides good protection . the bars on the gate are well spaced so even small infants shouldn t be able to crawl through . when properly installed it provides solid protection although important ! you should regularly check it to make sure it s securely affixed to the door frame . also over time the gate tends to bend a little so you should use the little wrench like tool to adjust it when necessary .in short a very good gate for keeping kids out of a certain room . but this is not designed and should never be used to guard the top of a stairway .this is an excellent gate . we needed a gate that did not rely strictly on tension mounts . the hardware mounting option is easy but the instructions are a little difficult to follow .it boils down to this you need to extend the gate to the correct length by popping the tabs the lock its position into place . these are painful to unpop but after one or two tries you ll get the hang of it . after that use the included paper template for where you need to drill holes . drill the holes inches deep you must go two inches or screwing in the screws will be hard to do even if you use your drill to screw them in . pop the gate onto the hinges that you mount after drilling drill screw in the mounts on the opposing side and you are done . its really much less complicated than the multi lingual directions lead you to believe .this has become our new favorite gate . once you get over the fear or dislike of drilling into your banisters handrails it really does become the most functional easy to secure gate you can buy in my opinion .we tried the metal tension mounted gates and they always seem to lose their grip and need to be re adjusted all the time . they also place alot of stress on your railings and if your railings flex at all maintaining the tension mount will be difficult . that is the major reason we chose this gate . additionally this gate swings open giving you of the width of your walkway to walk through whereas most tension mount gates have a smaller opening to walk through after you mount the gate .this is the best gate we have used !this gate has been great for the doorway to a room that we are in and out of constantly . i initially purchased thesummer infant sure and secure extra tall walk thru gate white but i had trouble with the latch staying closed not something you want with an ambitious baby around ! sure it is more difficult to step over this gate but it will never come unlocked to allow a child to break loose . it is easy to take down anytime you need with one hand easy to carry around and the plastic does not mar the door frame or paint on the wall i lean it against for storage when not in use . the gate can be left on the door frame when the door is closed .for us the summer infant door will not close with the gate up lever handle not a knob on the door so for naptime and bedtime the gate had to be taken off . this involves unscrewing all four pressure mount posts using two hands to carry the gate one on the door part one on the frame and finding a place to put it where the metal would not damage walls or furniture . i think it would be more appropriate for a place where removal was not often necessary . and the noise ! a baby grabbing the bars and shaking can make quite a racket !
there isn t much i can add to the good reviews already out there that i read before purchasing these for my american tele but i will say i really like these tuners and i m very happy i switched to them . high quality and great design . the guitar just stays in tune now period . attractive too with the fender f on the face of the locking knobs and not a big bulky look like i thought they may be before i tried them . very easily installed without any modification to the headstock of the guitar . if your thinking you might like to upgrade to locking tuners but having doubts whether you ll like them or if you should go with a different brand ? go with it and get a set of these ! if your experience is like mine you ll be very satisfied .i typically play d addario . s but i wanted to see what all the fuss was about with these . well i gotta say i m not stricken with disbelief at these but they are very nice . overall i would say that they feel about the same as my d addario strings but if the price is right i wouldn t mind a substitution every now and again . they do bend very nicely obviously your guitar s scale length and your ability to bend strings may vary .i decided to give these a try after buying just earnie balls . wow ! just wow ! my inexperienced ear was able to tell a difference in the sound . it was just . . . right . i can t explain it exactly . the . gauge is great for standard and eb tuning although can be tuned lower . i would recommend something thicker for that though . but these are great and you should get em !
should you need to connect a condenser microphone to a phantom power box so that it will work with an ordinary amplifier or mixer without phantom supply this is a good length for the link .i primarily use this as an usb adapter for my headphones so that i can connect convert the . mm headphone jack into my pc .the audio adapter is well built . it has a yellow led light that is solid when plugged into an usb port and blinks when there is a device that is connected to it through a . mm jack .installation was flawless . windows bit installed drivers immediately .no issues . no nonsense . simply works !i needed a way to boost the input of a wired lapel microphone coming from the preacher directly into my powered speakers . works great !
this is a high quality well made magnetic whiteboard from quartet . the whiteboard is very smooth and flat and has a slick aluminum frame . it s effortless to write on and easy to erase . the magnetic board allows sheets of papers to be pinned with magnets .the whiteboard comes with all the hanging hardware . it can be mounted horizontally or vertically . installation is as easy as snap on the marker tray align the two hangers on wall with level drill holes in wall insert anchors and screw in hangers and hang the whiteboard . one marker and two magnets are also included . the whiteboard can also be hung from cubicle partition walls with separately soldquartet cubicle partition hangers black mch . any magnets will work on the whiteboard but quartet has some colorful nice lookingquartet magnetic push pins high power magnets bright colors pack mppcb . i like the quartet matrix modular design allows multiple boards to be aligned and mounted with ease enabling a highly customizable layout in offices or in personal workshops .i am using this whiteboard in my personal space since it is a good size for me . i can easily unhang it and temporarily transport it to a different room without using any tools . it looks professional and blends in easily with any room decor . it is one of the finest whiteboards i have seen in the price range . highly recommended .what a clean look for a cork board . it has a smooth light oak frame and plenty of room for pinning . it came with hanging hooks nails but i choose to use the command brand picture hanging strips . wish the board had come with that type of hanging hardware as i dislike the damage hooks nails do to my walls . also if a couple of push pins had been included that would have been nice .it is not a heavy board so it doesn t take heavy hooks hanging strips to put it up . this will definitely keep my papers where i need them .this board has sort of an odd hanger . it doesn t operate the way picture or board hangers that i ve used before were made but it s not difficult . usually you attach the hanger to the picture or board and then hang the whole thing on a nail or hook on the wall . with this one you attach the hanger to the wall and then hang the board on the hanger . but as i said it s not difficult . the board seems to be sturdy with an inexpensive but sturdy enough frame . overall it s utilitarian but not ugly and should last well .
we love this product . being able to change the music our son listens to every nite is such a nice option and we don t have to listen to the same lullaby s all the time if at all .the light is dim but as a few others noted who wants a bright light ? the baby is trying to sleep !it s enough light to see him if i peek in and it s still on .i feel the volume is plenty loud enough . it is a crib cd player not a house cd player . it s plenty loud enough for his tiny nursery and i ve never turned it all the way up .i gave it stars instead of for the battery issue it eats batteries worse than any other toy he has including the swing which we use much more often .i thought that was strange and if it does take that much power it should come with rechargable batteries .maybe the next model overall we re very pleased though .we like this monitor . the reception is good and our house is pretty big . i can t figure out how to put batteries in the receivers but it s probably operator error . i like the light in the main unit .this monitor iis so simple and the features have been extremely useful . first this monitor comes with receivers a must for a two story home . we can hear everything including noise from outdoors . the red lights that blink in accordance to volume are great for those who can t see without glasses esp when waking up in the middle of the night and they are also great if say you have the tv on a bit too loud . the nightlight on the monitor with the minute timer is a great feature b c it doesn t generate heat as does a conventional outlet nightlight bulb . our baby also happens to be disturbed by her outlet nightlight when she wakes up at night and thus won t fall back to sleep easily . therefore we ve used the monitor light . we ve had no problems nor complaints with this product .

i like this brand of card stock nice weight ink absorbs evenly and the paper is scored making folding the paper into a card easy and precise .the thing is i expect paper in north america to be x not a smaller size . which is what this filler paper is . it s decent quality maybe paper which is acceptable no excess weight and not ultra thin and ultra cheap paper which feels impoverished and low grade . the holes are cleaned drilled the edges are crisp . the lines are a bit weak and i m comparing this filler paper to the tops notebook filler paper college ruled x . inches hole punched medium weight white sheets pack i ve been buying for my kids the past few years . the tops paper is full size which is a big deal to me . the paper weight is about equal to the mead filler paper . the holes and page trim and equally clean . the printed lines the greenish horizontal and the red vertical are stronger than the mead paper .this is good filler paper but if i were you i d buy the tops notebook filler paper instead mostly because it s full sized x and also because the printing of the lines rules is stronger .i set out on a mission to find the best premium laser paper for our new xerox multifunction device . it came with some nice xerox premium paper which intrigued me as to what the state of the premium paper market was .i ll be quick out the gate and tell you that this was the best paper i tried out of the three the other washammermill ultra smooth lb x inch laser print office paper sheets andxerox premium laser copy paper brightness lb x white sheets per ream r .this paper was the brightest whitest smoothest of all three . printing a full sized full color photo led to a picture that looked smooth and without texture showing through from the paper . when printing a powerpoint i got the cleanest reproduction with the least bleed through on the other side .the paper is thick though and almost borders on presentation paper likehp premium presentation paper . even on the thick paper setting on the copier the xerox we have is new and fairly advanced i still received the most misfeeds jams with this paper . it s the best paper but it comes at the price of more work to use it at least for me . this is why i ve rated it stars instead of .that being said what you need in a premium paper may vary from person to person and project o project . if you weren t putting the three papers side by side it wouldn t be so obvious that this hp paper is the brightest white . and sometimes you want a premium paper without feeling like a collection of card stock when you gather a few pages . in that case thehammermill ultra smooth lb x inch laser print office paper sheets is my second choice .if you prefer something a bit thinner my second choice was thehammermill ultra smooth lb x inch laser print office paper sheets . it s a bit less ultra super white but has a very nice smooth feel and print quality and doesn t let the second side bleed through as much as the xerox paper .if you are doing single sided prints and want paper that feels more like regular paper the xerox is a totally fine option .in conclusion the very best paper is this paper for premium all around laser printing . it s thick . it s probably thicker than i d use for every day use . it would be totally appropriate for an office where clients visit the office and leave with a print out for internal office printing that gets filed permenantly or displayed and when you don t want to pay the premium for presentation paper .

i m happy with this . used it to replace the blown speaker from a yr . old w roland cube amp a bass player used the amp and i think it was too much for the speaker next time i ll use the pa for the bass player . much better sound perfect fit etc . keep in mind this is for a very clean sound and this speaker was recommended for its clean and somewhat smokey type sound . i believe it has those . using this for jazz applications and having the roland around as a second amp .i own two of these behringer boxes they come in two modals and use them with sonor cakewalk and an internal software sound modual roland virtual sound canvas to play back midi files with my live two piece band . the sound through the pa soundcraft mixer and mackie active speakers is loud and very clear in most cases no eq needed . i guess it really revolves around your personal needs . for live performance these behringer boxes are excellent and the price is a steal . i do not use it to record as my home recording is done on a stand alone daw tascam track .if you are a live musician or a dj using something like virtual dj these boxes are a great way to eliminate low level hum from a laptop and give you a dramtically better sound than most internal laptop sound cards .my old pair of jbl studio pro computer monitors finally gave up the ghost . at the time mid s these were the best you could expect for computer monitors . i do mixing and voice overs so i needed the real deal . after extensive research and listening i decided on the m audio bx a deluxe . for the price they can not be beat ! punchy crisp bass smooth highs and great mid range . they are also very accurate i hear things just the way they are recorded . they also bring to light subtleties in old cd s that i have never heard before ! also the wood construction gives these speakers a warmer resonance than others made out of plastic or metal . if you have a studio on a budget and need the best speakers for under . buy these . remember they are studio monitors so the audio is going to be very directional so use them for monitors . great speakers for portables like an ipod . one note you need a really good sound card to get the most from these babies !
they are i was i spected good quality good presentation perfeect price good for child and good for babies from monthsvery good i hope my daughter loves my daughter is too young still use it not very good i was prepared for herthese are great bottles . i got them for my great grand son who is due in march . mother was very pleased to receive such good bottles .
needed this velcro product to use with my motorhome and boats . i hate having hoses electric cords and the like all tangled . with this flat velcro i can cut the length i need and wrap things up . holds tight . very happy with the purchase .who gets excited about binder clips ? i guess i do . i use them as chip clips to close sacks of flour and other pantry items to hang gloves and hats you name it . if it can be clipped i use these . killer price too ! get them in every size you ll use them .i always have these on hand and use them in all sorts of ways . here is a short list . . . . keeps potato chip cereal and other bags tightly rolled up . have thumb tacks or screws to hang these on for papers photos even magazines . clothes line hangers ! work much better than the wooden sets and no spring to fail . hold cables together for organization . need to unplug something ? just open it up and close back on the remaining cables ! . when working on my car i use these to hold wires and other small things out of the way . on an aquarium use these not just to organize your cable but to move airline tube out of sight . use a thumbtack to keep it where you want it . hang the floor mats from your car to hose them off . i have screws setup just for this purpose . leave them hanging to dry . torturethere are many more ways to use these and i am sure people have great suggestions ! add them to the comments on this review ! for the money you just cannot beat the versatility . these well made clips will last a long time and are completely worth buying over and over again .
these three packs are not available at my local pet shop and if you compare cost it s an easy decision ! these are the same foams that come with the ac when you purchase the filter .the product came as described .my mistake for buying such a small tube . i needed a larger one to set up a false bottom for my emperor scorpion enclosure but the product came well packaged dirt cheap and feels solid for people using it on aquariums !thanks !it would have been nice to have the spring as pictured but it is not there . i am still happy with the product and recommend purchasing but do realize if you want a spring you will have to buy it separately or purchase a different cable that does include it .
 fuzzy wuzzy s summary highly recommended with warm fuzzies !i have used up many lengths and widths of these one wrap straps over the years and it is not because these straps break or get lost but because i just keep finding more and more uses for this . velcro straps previously came with separate hook only and loop only straps . these one wrap straps have the hooks on one side and the loops on the other side and are optimized for bundling wrapping purposes while still being easily flipped around for closure if you are routing these straps in more intricate arrangements . so you do not need to keep separate hook only and loop only straps . these straps are very durable even after years of use . they do not tear stretch or fray at the edges and both the hook and loop sides remain very sticky to each other after repeatedly attaching and detaching over the span of several years .these one wrap straps are my favorite brand and style of velcro strap . velcro also makes cinch straps that have plastic buckles so they are easier to cinch tightly and while they have their uses too the cinch straps are more expensive cannot have their lengths precisely cut to a specific length and really do not perform any better than these cut it yourself one wrap straps unless you really do need something tightly cinched together . so while i have several of the velcro cinch straps the bulk of my velcro applications come from using these one wrap straps and the adhesive backed industrial strength velcro tape . the industrial strength velcro tape is great for both indoor and outdoor mounting of objects that need to be removable . these one wrap straps also work great when used in conjunction with the velcro tape to serve as removable fasteners stick either the hook or loop side of the industrial strength velcro tape on a surface wrap the object that is to be secured fastened with this velcro one wrap and attach the one wrap to the velcro tape .here are just a few of the many ways that i have used this velcro one wrap electric cords extension cords computer cables garden hoses christmas tree lights and other rope like objects stay much more organized and untangled with a few sections of one wrap wrapped around them . when transporting bicycles on racks i use these to prevent the wheels pedals and handlebars from moving around . i sometimes use bungee cords for these functions but bungee cords sometimes cannot be looped around the handlebars to remain taut . i keep a small roll of one wrap in my hiking backpack and it has various uses during hiking and camping . these one wrap straps are great for wrapping around rolled up sleeping bags sleeping mats and yoga mats . i keep a small roll of one wrap in my photography backpack . i also used velcro to create a tripod holder for my camera holster bag which was not designed to hold a tripod . i attached two rectangles of velcro tape on the straight side of the camera holster bag and then i wrapped one layer of this velcro one wrap around the middle of the folded up travel sized compact tripod and another layer of one wrap is wrapped near the tripod legs . the tripod can then be attached to the velcro tape that is stuck to the side of the camera holster bag . i then wrap a third section of one wrap tightly around the tripod s head and loop that strap through the holster s d ring where the shoulder strap clips onto . detaching the tripod from the holster bag is a simple matter of quickly pulling open all three one wrap straps and i can now bring a tripod with my camera holster bag for outings where i do not care to bring the much larger camera backpack with me .i always keep some of this one wrap in my toolbox my hiking backpack my photography backpack and in the glove storage compartment of my car . the only limit to how to use this is your imagination i m glad to see that avery is dealing with one of the annoying problems with binders when the rings don t close together accurately and consequently pages hand up or tear on them . i opened and closed them several times and they work well closing accurately . leaving no troublesome protruding edges .this binder is well made . it has two pockets on the insides of both the front cover and back cover . the rings are shaped so that the pages turn smoothly but also lay flat either against the inside of the front cover or the back cover .the next time i am in the market for more binders i will shop for this one .highly recommended .hello i have been using velcro straps with ring clips on the ends to wrap large and small items . you pull the strap through the ring and cinch the velcro . but the problem with these types of straps is if the item is smaller than the length of the velcro area you have to wrap the strap several times to get the velcro to fit . now with this new one wrap velcro you can roll it tight around the cord to keep it attached to the cord . then you roll your rope or line and when you are finished the velcro attaches snugly everytime . if you have the original velcro tape with the male female sides attach the male sticky end on a surface and this product attaches easily . this is a great product . you can t go wrong with velcro .update april after finishing off that first roll of the velcro i ordered more . this product has a bazillion uses and i keep finding more . it is not the sticky back kind but it must wrap onto itself . transporting and carrying a long hose ? neat and tidy . keeping pvc pipes together ? excellent . finally placing rope lines anywhere you want is easy with this type of velcro . roll the rope wrap the velcro around once overlap and make a longer loop to whatever you want to attach the coiled rope . if the longer loop is reattached to the initial velcro that gives you a handy carrying handle for the rope . the product is outstanding and the delivery was superb .
this fits our crib mattress tightly and keeps our baby from sweating against the vinyl of the crib mattress . we didn t have a mattress pad with our son and he would wake up soaking wet from sweating against the vinyl of the crib mattress . the crib sheet alone wasn t enough to keep him from sweating . this pad is also not too bulky so it doesn t cause a safety concern . just make sure the pad fits tightly on your crib mattress for safety s sake . we have a sealy crown jewel mattress and it fits great on it .this crib rail guard did stop by toddler from chewing on the wood rails of her crib . it stuck on well enough and fit well over the wood of the front of the crib too but the plastic has a sticky feel to it even the upright side that isn t supposed to stick to anything . i noticed when putting the baby in the crib her blanket or clothes would sometimes stick to it . i ended up buying the cloth crib rail guards which look better and can be put in the washing machine . i d recommend the cloth tie on rail guards over this one .this review is for the universal bedside co sleeper which is exactly the same as the original except it s sized for beds that are inches tall the original is sized for beds that are inches tall and taller .after only a few weeks of using a traditional high sided cradle for our baby who gets up to nurse several times in a night we decided that we needed something to make moving the baby between her bed and ours easier . we chose the bedside co sleeper and we haven t been disappointed .the low side of the co sleeper is level with our mattress and the mattress of the co sleeper is about inches lower than that . this means that when my baby wakes in the middle of the night to nurse i only have to lift her four inches to get her into my bed . i don t even have to sit up to manage this . plus since there are no bars or slats between her bed and mine when she s fussy at night i can easily reach out a hand to soothe her or find the pacifier she s let slip from her mouth . the four outside pockets one on each short end and two on the long end are convenient for holding burp cloths extra diapers baby wipes etc everything i need for late night feeding and changing .some reviewers have complained that the mattress is too hard . actually i found that the mattress is padded but lumpy . this is because it s designed to fold up so the co sleeper can be portable and fit into a travel bag . i solved the problem by putting a quilted multi use pad on top of the mattress underneath the fitted sheet . the quilting helped smooth out the lumps and make the mattress more comfortable without making it so soft that i m worried about a smothering hazard . also the pad is good protection for the mattress in case of nighttime accidents since the mattress is made only of cloth with no plastic cover unlike typical cradle mattresses . be sure to buy at least one extra fitted sheet when you purchase the bed one is included with the bed itself since regular crib or cradle sheets won t fit .my only complaint so far is that the solid fabric sides of the co sleeper prevented me from hanging my baby s crib toys on the bed . otherwise i ve found this bed to be an absolute lifesaver and the only kind of infant bed i would recommend .
i read the reviews on rubbermaid storage and sure glad i did buy that junk . this is made pretty good . it has a foot latch on the bottom and a place for a lock on the top of the doors . i m not sure yet if anyone makes a lock that will fit it though . ordinary padlocks won t work . you may be able to find a long hasp lock that will fit . i have two split rings and a small lock on it right now . not much security but it keeps honest people out . i have it on my newly built patio and i attached x s to the wall and screwed the cabinet to them . so at least someone can t walk away with it .you need to get some small screws and nuts to hold it together . it pretty flimsy but is okay when you add your own screws . nothing like rubbermaids junk though . there are no black holes or other items in the nightmare reviews like those on rubbermaid . i m an aerospace design engineer so i see plenty of design features that could be better . but for the i paid for it and a few screws it s okay .this is suitable for the home office which is where i have it . i have the one that is feet wide and feet high which is probably larger than i need and it seems much larger on the wall . the price seems unreasonable marked down to as of because the frame is plastic and the layer of cork is extremely thin . anyone who is budget conscious and handy might consider buying cheap cork tiles and mounting them on plywood instead . it comes with clear instructions mounting hardware and two plastic semi circles which can be used to hold papers without pushpins .i have three suggestions if the manufacturer ever revises this design . first it can only be hung horizontally and that may not be convenient for home offices that lack horizontal wall space . it should be an easy fix to make this hang vertically as well . second i don t understand why industrial strength mounting hardware was used when the board is so light that any ook ! picture hanger could hold it . that hardware also means extra work to measure with a level and drill holes . . .all unnecessary really . third only two of the plastic clips are included . there should have been more they are such thin and flimsy plastic pieces that i expect them to break in short order .bottom line if you have the money and the wall space and are comfortable fussing about with a drill to get four brackets into the wall this bulletin board should work for you . it doesn t have a nasty cork odor it looks professional and once affixed to the wall it should stay forever .so many places are carrying the new plastic hook type key tags for cabinets it was great i found these at amazon . i realize it isn t a big deal unless your co workers need them .
it s larger than i expected but i will keep it until my son can fit into it . my son is lbs and around inches which is why i bought the large based on the weight recommendation but even the medium is quite large on him right now . would suggest using the height recommendation as a closer indicator of what size to buy rather than weight .do not look at the weight ranges when deciding on a size . my son is at the top end of the size large weight range but this item will still fit him for many months . instead look at the height ranges for a more accurate size determination . my tall son is growing out of size month clothing but the size large sleepsack size months will fit him for many more months .this stroller frame is easy to use light folds nicely has a big storage basket and navigates well . i highly recommend getting this to use with your infant carrier vs . a travel system .
so first up i ve been using macs to record music since the g cube . . . yeah go look that up . anyway i know my way around audio recording on apple devices .and then yeah this thing looks kind of cheesy or flimsy . . .but i haven t encountered anything so plug play simple as the apogee jam k since gefen introduced the imic . just plug in the usb or lightning cable plug in your instrument and go .also it s not flimsy . it is made of plastic but the thing has a bit of heft to it and survived a tumble to the floor from my desk .it pulls power from your machine so no worries about some adapter introducing hum to your recordings . this also helps those of us using electric guitars that don t have extra wound humbuckers .i tested the apogee jam on a new macbook air an iphone and a ipad mini . garageband instantly knew what was going on but protools did need a bit of coaching .a small device that doesn t color input sound and doesn t get in the way . . . just what i needed !great stereo sound out of the keyboards .my keys had a single stereo out so this cable was needed to get it to convert to a true channel stereo so we could eq it properly and it worked like a charm . i highly recommend this cable .when i plugged this into my computer and keyboard it said one midi device detected but i was not getting sounds from my piano onto my computer . i simple took the midi in and the midi out and switched them and the problem was instantly solved . if your midi is not working right try what i did switching the cables to the opposite side . sounds ridiculous but it might save you a bit of time . d
very good purchase for the money . very good quality and worth what i paid . like i said in the title it s huge . i can get the zippers to about inches apart with a x motocross helmet with the visor attached . if i take the visor off it has plenty of room to spare . i don t think you could find a helmet without a visor that is too big for this bag .i use an afx fx size x sold here on amazon if you want to see what visor i m talking about .i like that once my helmet goggles and gloves are dry i can store them all in this bag .i don t need a gallon of this stuff . i don t need a quart . i don t even need a pint . . . so this was the perfect size to have on hand for occaional small engine reassembly and repair .i ordered these tire irons to change the tires on my buell blast the fact that they include a pouch to keep the tire irons in is a great addition . i used them to mount my rear tire pirelli diablo and it really held up to the job . i was think that with the way that i was cranking on these that it would bend but not so . i would have to agree with other reviews that to have another pack so that i would have tire irons to use while mounting is a good idea . i know it ups the price a bit but it s worth it . i did get my tire mounted with just two but i did notice there was a point where i wouldn t have minded having a rd . . .great tire iron i would recommend these . .
these avery white shipping labels are perfect for my use . before i got these i used two address labels on all my postage one for the address of the person with whom i am corresponding and another for my return address .with this label i am able to fit my return address on the upper left side of the label and the shipping address on the lower right side of the label .one of the nice things about avery products is that a person can get a template free that works well with each specific product . in this case a person can get avery template template and software on the internet . i have used avery templates for many years and found them perfect for the designed label in this case label .i recommend avery white shipping labels for laser printers . this is a quality product .the avery internet shipping labels make it easy to recycle those boxes and padded envelopes that you ve received . this saves money and is a green practice . this package contains sheets . x and each sheet has labels . x . .important the avery labels are for ink jet printers only . i called avery to ask if these labels could also be used in a laser printer . i was told that they should not be used in a laser printer because the heat might melt the adhesive material and it could damage the printer . for laser printers useavery white shipping labels for laser printers with trueblock tm technology inches x inches box of .these labels are designed to work with the us postal service s click n ship stamps dot com and ebay and paypal s online postage . or you can use avery s templates . one of the great things about the avery labels is how easy they make it to fill out the label information . the avery website has more than templates to choose from . you can choose from avery design print online avery designpro for windows and macs download templates for microsoft word or download the avery wizard for microsoft word . you can even do a mail merge for printing multiple labels .these are the size of those commercial address labels that you can order off of those inserts from sunday newspapers . an a size paper has four columns of these labels . three lines of text in font size the smallest you can read without a magnifying glass will fit on this label . so if your address has four lines these won t work for you .they are not entirely removable because some adhesive comes off and then they do not stick as well the second time . microsoft word has templates for avery size and and you can find other templates at microsoft office online web site . free software download is also available at avery web site .i use them as return address labels and also to label electronic equipment like cell phone ipad etc with name email address and phone number in three lines of size font . you can find other similar uses . they work well in laser printers too .the price of these address labels keeps changing but as of august m permanent adhesive return address labels x inches white laser labels per pack q m return address labels white inch x inch sheets per pack r total labels are a littles less expensive . the real competition are the preprinted address labels from inserts in sunday newspaper which come out far less expensive than these but then you cannot print them at your whim or personalize them .
i use this item for my daughter size guitar its looks light in weight and firm and can be adjusted for different sizes of guitars .works great with my baritone ukulele . same quality as my full size acoustic guitar capo . easily fits in my ukulele case too .i love this guitar and one can not go wrong with a yamaha i currently have acoustical yamaha guitars . the fg s is a full size dreadnought style steel string guitar . i usually do not like full size guitars as they do not fit in my lap well but this one is perfect for me and i can reach the full length of the neck with no problems . it has a deep tone and good volume . i give stars to this guitar and recommend for the beginner as well as seasoned player .
i love this assortment of permanent markers ! it makes marking items that much more fun ! gone are the days of just the black permanent marker . . .boring ! these babies allow you to write tag embellish whatever you want however you wish . i have used these markers to make name tags to write on canvas cloth vinyl metal plastic . . .and more ! i have not been disappointed yet . great assortment of markers !one reviewer said this if you re tired of pencil erasers going stale not erasing smudging and ripping the paper then buy these . they work great and last long . i completely agree .i have pencils with white erasers that go dry i have a white eraser from a dollar store that looks like these but it smudges .there may be a rival to these but you can t go wrong with these . i used these on a book with very thin paper and they did erase the marks thoroughly .i found a year old sharpie fine point marker in a backpack when i was cleaning and it still worked ! i bought this set and have not been disappointed . these markers are vibrant permanent of course and a pleasure to write with . yes they bleed through paper but i use these for labeling or for single sheets . excellent color choices and satisfying to write with .
you learn that when there is a power outage the cordless will not work because the base is plugged into the electrical socket so its a good little phone to have plugged into a landline that s there when you need it even if you have a cell phone . . . .because you could have a low battery and this landline though to some out dated it sure helps in a pinch . !back up phone that operates without power . so can be plugged into any jack in the house . runs if we trip any circuit .because of the shape of this phone it will not charge in my answering machine unit . you can get it to talk to the other units by taking off the battery cover and putting it in the base . but you need to charge it in its own cradle . that can be a pain sometimes . i do like the navigation system on it better than my original handset from the .

i got into the aquarium hobby back in the seventies with my dad . from this perspective aquarium filtration has vastly improved from the old floss filters . any of you old timers remember those ? floss filters with metal frame tanks boy those were the days not ! i have learned one valuable lesson from years of fish husbandry . never use the manufactures suggested sizes for filtration . at the very least double it if you want a good clean tank . i run two aquaclear s on my forty gallon tank . i changed to this configuration from a marineland canister with a bio wheel . the advantages of a two filter set up should be self explanatory . i run one of them with a hagen fluval surface skimmer to keep the surface clear of scum . it is a setup that works well . this is an easy filter to run with custom media too . i buy my charcoal in bulk and use filter bags . this is cheaper then buying the individual bags .the only issue with the filter becomes apparent during a power outage . if your tank is low it might not regain suction . no damage will occur to the filter though as they are magnetically driven . keeping your tank topped off is the best way to avoid this issue . i have never had an issue with this filter leaking outside the tank . it only has a slight inside leak if run wide opened . it is also easy to disassemble and clean . i have had to replace one broken impeller .this is a very dependable and stable filter that is easy to maintain .aquarium filters remove many harmful chemicals but nitrates do accumulate over time and the way to remove them is by periodic partial water changes usually something like per week . the old way was to siphon water out into a bucket which was dumped down the sink commode or in the yard . the bucket was then refilled and poured back into the tank .to change water in this manner was a little bit labor intensive on a small tank and really time consuming on a larger tank .i stumbled on my pump in a thrift store where i found it on a shelf for . in all honesty i m not sure mine is lee brand as it wasn t in the original package and there is no name on it . it may actually be a knock off . mine is made of blue plastic and looks identical to the item pictured .it operates by connecting it to a water supply which can be either an outside hose spigot or by using the adapter a kitchen faucet .water flows through from top to bottom past a venturi located where the side fitting is creating a suction which will draw water out of the aquarium through a hose . i purchased feet of clear vinyl hose from my local aquarium store attached it to this device and put a suction strainer on the other end to avoid sucking small fish into the hose .in use i drop the suction strainer into the tank unroll the hose and attach the pump to the water tap outside my front door . opening the diverter the blue collar on the pump outlet then turning on the water tap starts a siphon which removes as much water from my tank as i desire water tap can be closed once siphon starts so long as the pump is lower than the tank siphon will continue .closing the diverter on the pump outlet stops the siphon and opening the water tap with the diverter closed refills the tank .i can t imagine any way to make water changes any easier . i ve been using this device for years now and it still works great .there are also attachments which allow you to vacuum the gravel with the water siphoning out of the tank if you feel the need to perform this task i never vacuum because i don t use an undergravel filter because i use ecocomplete substrate and because i have fish which eat any food which falls to the bottom so for me the need simply isn t there .get this to rid of parasites if you do not have any inverts . very effective and safe for my tank no casualties just parasite free . i don t use this for my saltwater anymore since i used seachem cupramine to remove my copper so that i could add inverts to my tank safely now . i still have it for my freshwater tank tho .
i mounted this as an auxiliary transmission cooler in my jeep grand cherokee laredo x with the . . no issues . obviously this was a custom installation . but with a little research on the jeep forums no problem .bought this to install with an aftermarket kenwood navigation on my toyota tacoma . it took several hours to install but it works great with the wheel controls in my toyota .exact fit for lexus rx . as easy to install as i could ve expected with all parts the sensor the cable and the plug matching the original layout .
i reviewed this for the basic fisher price healthy care instead of here for the deluxe so you can read that review for more details .it s great and i would recommend to anyone looking for an alternative to a stand alone high chair !this product is wonderful and better than i expected . it is well made and i have recommended this product to my friends for the excellent quality of this product . it is a must buy and well worth the amount i paid for it . i am extremely pleased with this product and will buy again from this seller due to the quality of the product i just saw this product at target for . more than what i paid here this is a great tray and a wonderful product for anyone with a baby toddler buy it here cause in any store you will pay more .
very simple device to connect a quality dynamic microphone or instrument using a direct box to the usb input of a computer . i plugged in my mic and plugged the cable into my pc . win automatically searched for and found the drivers in about three minutes . i then recorded some vocals using audacity a free open source download . recording was whisper quiet with no background hiss or noise at all . recording level was great not sure why some reviewers said it was too low . note that this will not provide phantom power nor does the item description imply that it will . usb only provides vdc and phantom power usually requires vdc . unless there is some kind of power converter which would be much too large to fit in this compact package it is impossible for this or any similar sized cable to provide the higher voltage that phantom power requires . use this with a dynamic mic or direct box and if you use it correctly you will be very happy !i got this cable to run to my electronic drum set at the other end of the studio as a previous cable failed on me . the balanced lead works well and the cable is very quiet . construction features too well soldered trs male connections and the only downside i can complain about is the lack of strain relief . . .but nothing major and the cables work fine none the less .should you need to connect a condenser microphone to a phantom power box so that it will work with an ordinary amplifier or mixer without phantom supply this is a good length for the link .
these are the only nipples my baby will take besides mommy s . they are very hard to find . . and i don t know why since it seems i am not the only mommy who is looking for them . i wish amazon would offer them with free shipping ! ! ! ! ! hint hint cheapest place to buy them is on amazon . you get a package of for this price . they work great to seal bottles and it s always nice to have extras of these especially if you re going to freeze store your milk .my first review ever on any website but figure what site to better start my review process than amazon itself .first i received this as part of my registry and amazon had sent the wrong version of the tub . despite the error amazon customer service was outstanding . not only did the rep corrected the mistake and got everything processed in a matter of minutes with free shipping to return the wrong product but the replacement came literally overnight at no cost to me or the gift giver . that s what i call customer service and surely many retailers should learn from amazon especially if they want to keep their customers happy and loyal .okay now to the product . . . this is one of the most functional and practical item that all new parents should seriously have on their must have lists . the sling certainly comes in handy for newborns as it acts as an extra support for their bodies and prevents them from sliding down . in addition the storage area is a huge plus the right amount to put in what you really need or use to bathe your child . to help the drying process i angle it and put it upside down against the tub sprout which i find to help a lot if you want to prevent mildew etc after each use .i m looking forward to using this tub as my baby grows and transitions from newborn to toddler . . . lt . 
it s very helpful to hold my lamp just above the tank . adjustable and just great . very stable and you can slide the platform right under the tank so it can t move .if you are tired of carrying buckets back and forth the fish tank this one is for you . it attaches to your faucet and you can siphon and fill the tank . i use this on the laundry faucet which i needed to buy the additional brass adapter . it allows me to leave one piece connected to the faucet and the other to the plastic connector . then when i need to use it it snaps in place to the faucet and it is easy to remove .this floating box is ok . the v shaped piece allows fry to drop down without incident and the slits on the side are fairly small . some of your smaller newborn fry will get out though but it contained most of mine . it does seem to make the tank a lot more crowded though because it sits in the tank . i prefer the hang on tank style where you use an air line to pump water in and the water trickles back into the main tank .
works just like it needs to . perfect fit for the tailgate on my chevy when the oem clip busted .fit my nissan frontier s oil pan perfectly . looks to be of nice quality . torque to ft lbs on the frontier anyway these item does fit perfect on my bmw x . does what its suppose to do . so far so good thanks
i like this brand of card stock nice weight ink absorbs evenly and the paper is scored making folding the paper into a card easy and precise .most people have no idea what pound weight paper is . . . that is average for a spiral notebook the reason i like this one is because its pound paper so its stronger . its not that real heavy paper but its stronger than almost all loseleaf paper and stronger than almost all spiral notebook paper . just an fyi computer paper that printers use are also pound paper . enjoy .with staples and a staple remover this swingline is a bonus .it is light weight but has a firm pinch on paper .
one spots come with an pedal multi plug . if you only have pedals or lets say you have powering them with an plug makes it difficult to isolate power and noise levels properly . the left over connectors can cause ground issues if they touch things when they aren t plugged into pedals . using this smaller multi plug will leave less open spaces alternatively it can be attached to any link in another multiplug to add more plugs . very nice quality just as with all one spot stuff . great price great purchase .this pedal adds that i don t know what to your sound .i chased a sound for years until buying this pedal what a difference .if you have great top quality cable quiet amps and pedal boards shielded guitars fresh tubes you know the drill you spend thousands chasing something you hear in your head then you plug one pedal in and whamo ! ! there it is !it was this pedal for me just turn the knobs until it comes out of your speakers .a must have especially if you are playing clubs bars or arenas you have a pedal board and you are looking for that sound that is gonna finally push your sound out front give your notes clarity during leads make overdriven chords ring .i like this pedal it s on my board and it s never coming off .sounds just like an amp in your headphones ! gain tone and fx switch make for a broad range of sound since you won t be able to use any pedals . this is a great little piece of kit if you have some fun money to spend on it . star off because while nothing fell out the plugs on both the bass and headphone side are very loose feeling .
i have an unusual use case for this pump . i have four fish tanks with tropical fish . cleaning them can be a chore . i prepare water in a gallon container add chlorine killer adjust ph heat water in winter . after using the gravel vac to remove about half of the water i was using a small three quart bucket to tote water to refill the tanks . not too bad for gallon tank but with a gallon tank it s a lot of toting . and bending over . my back was not too happy doing this . so i got a ft of clear tubing and this pump . i drop the pump into the bucket and just sit and watch while the pump does all the work ! i purchased this pump because i needed to pump the water from floor level to about . feet and this model was rated for that level . my large gallon tank fills in minutes which is just right . i don t use this pump every day but it has been doing it s job flawlessly for almost three years and it is still working well pumping water uphill . this was an economical way to fill my fish tanks and i m very happy with it .i know most won t think this matters but i was curious of this question myself . i measured the rear compartment of the aquapod beforehand and the measurements for this pump were a little bigger . i bought it anyway and use it as a back up pump in my gallon tank . the pump is strong too strong for the nano but fine for the gallon and can be a primary pump for a larger tank with no problems . if you re looking for a strong pump this is the one . again the pump will not fit in the rear compartment of the nano . the pump can be attached to the glass or work with under gravel filters also as it comes with a lot of extra adapters .the fittings are not standard for python or aqueon pumps .so it sits in a bin unused till i get adapters .
great high chair for travel ! ! we started using this when our daughter was old enough to sit up it came in handy when travel because restaurants high chairs are huge for a months old and filthy . our daughter is now months lbs and we still use it . you just wipe off the tray with a diaper wipe and throw it back in the trunk until you need it again . it s nice to go anywhere and always have a seat .this is the best potty chair in our me and my toddler opinion . easy to clean and super comfortable for her . plus since lots of our friends use them she has her potty when we go over .my son started using this potty at months . it is one of the only potties small enough for infant potty training . the potty has a great splash gard and appears to be shaped to help my son go . almost like the squatting position you see kids do in diapers .although i have seen kids as old as . using this potty it appears to be geared more for younger ones .
this photo paper is amazing . getting borderless x photos to print without cutting a quarter inch off in every direction on the other hand seems to be impossible on hp printers though . . and hp support is dismal . over hours on the line with them photo papers testing their idiotic suggestions they force you to do if you want to get to an actual technician and tons of ink wasted . then they just keep you on hold forever and once in awhile the rep pops in and accuses you of not answering when they picked up which never actually happened . then after hours they send you a brand new refurbished unit that has a different error within a week .so great paper really bad printers and customer support .using this printer with my mac has given me headaches so mac users listen up . this printer works well and is one of the more cost effective options out there . but if you run into problems like getting random error messages when trying to print i have found the easiest solution is to unplug the power cord from the printer and plug it back in . it seems to re set the printer and debug whatever problem was going on . it s annoying but aren t all printers ?when my toner light when on on my printer even before my prints started to look faded i was suspicious that there was still more usable life and toner in the cartridge . after doing an internet search i discovered that if you put masking or electrical tape over the hole on the side of the toner cartridge you can get more prints out of it !there is a passthrough hole where the printer shines a light through the cartridge . cover that up and the printer still thinks there is plenty of toner and will continue to work . when your prints start coming out faded you can then replace the toner cartridge . much more environmentally friend and cost effective than to replace it when the print thinks you should even if it s not empty .
fit my gallon long wide high just right . the two glass pieces came already inserted into the plastic piece that allows the glass to be lifted for feeding . the other extra plastic piece goes onto the rear glass piece in case you have filters in the back and need to cut slots out for them . however i don t use that plastic piece and have a inch and a half space that fits well for my filter and heater . it also comes with an attachable handle that makes it easier to lift the glass .i guessed and ordered this to replace the foam in my tom mini internal filter for my gallon fish tank . this is the perfect width and i just cut each foam piece into about five pieces to fit the filter . since there are foam pads in the carton i can make about refills for my filter .i orderd this for my g tall . the picture is deceiving . there is a front piece of glass and a back piece of glass and then a small piece of plastic . if you have a hob filter or anything somewhat big you will not be able to use this canopy . junk .
the ink cartridge is o .k . but the epson r printer is a huge ink hog . the epson printer s that use this cartridge should all be recalled .i bought these canon pgi bk pack pigment black ink tanks for my canon ip pixma printer .pros reliabilitythese ink cartridge are very reliable . i ve yet to encounter a fail ink cartridge that the printer has to reject ink usageat the lowest quality mode i can print about a ream s worth of paper double sided .cons expensive inkthese printer cartridges are expensive . my printer usescyan cli c magenta cli m yellow cli y also sold as amultipack and the two black cartridges pgi andcli black also sold as amultipack .since my printer uses all of the color ink cartridges at about the same rate even in grayscale mode the price of ink cartridge replacements can be a lttle steep . i ve never had a problem with the canon pgi bk ink tanks . the main gripe i have is the high price ink cartridge replacements .although the quality of the ink is good this cartridge holds only ml of ink .
the first and only water conditioner i have ever used for my betta . spike is now yrs old and continues to thrive . i attribute that in part to aquasafe water conditioner .my cat loves to drink from this fountain and uses it more than she would a regular bowl . i introduced it to her at years old after using a bowl her whole life and it took a while for her to get use to but she loves it now . the fountain worked great for a while . . . .but after a couple of weeks it started becoming very noisy . this fountain is very picky . if any little thing is bothering it it makes a tremendous amount of sound and it is a pain to figure out what exactly is bothering it . so this kind of defeats the purpose of it being a self cleaning fountain . it also does not recycle the water very well . the water still gets very dirty and i see pieces all the time that don t go through the filter . i think the filter is actually cleaner than the actual water my cat drinks from when i go to change the filter every month . i wouldn t really recommend this product . . .after having it for about months i need something more efficient . . .update on my original review . . .it s now june i originally purchased this product mid . it s still running like new i still love it and so do my cats .original review i bought this item several months ago thinking my maine coon would love it since she loves running water . well both she and my norwegian forest cat love it . i don t think it s difficult to clean . everything comes apart very easily . the filter comes apart in pieces so you can really clean out any clogs . i can t see why anyone would complain about cleaning it wouldn t they clean their cats water bowls ? the fact that i only clean this once a week is a breeze . my only problem was that my cat kept taking off the very top piece with her paw then removing the filter . i now tape the top piece down after each cleaning and that has solved the problem . i ve owned this product for several months and it still works as if it were brand new . i think my cats are attracted to the fountain aspect as they seem to be drinking a lot more water than when they were given standing water in a regular bowl . i whole heartedly recommend this product .
while it is not suitable for newborn angel fry as depicted on the front they only eat fresh hatched brine shrimp it is adequate as a later stage weaning food for angelfish . guppies fry love it from the get go ! the quality of this food is far superior to the plastic bottle of fry food . . . much fresher tastier to the fish . because the food is in a envelope this may keep better but the envelope can be cumbersome for food dispensing so i transfer the food to the old plastic container for easier control dispensing . i have a large stock of fry in several species of fish so seem to go through the food quickly enough that it doesn t harm the freshness factor while in use .our fish are very happy being fed tetramin food . we have tried other food and some of the fish were very unhappy and they grow better with tetra food !my blood red parrot and pacu fish love this food . my parrot fish pushs the pacu out of the way to get to the food . worth the money .
so easy to use and turn on and off . it dose not burn your hand like the others do when left out in the sun .this is a little red flashlight period . yes the red light is bright and yes it blinks if you set it to do so . but this would never take the place of a real flare under any circumstances .do not buy this to replace the flares you should carry in your car emergency kit ! ! ! !most flashlights have the light beam coming straight out of the end of the tube . this one has the light coming off the side like a beacon or lighthouse . it can only be viewed from straight on ! while a flare puts out intense light in all directions like a sparkler this little flashlight only puts out light in one direction the direction you have faced the beam . do not buy except as a toy or as a hiking signal light i have given it two stars for it being at least that useful .flare ? no way .this rivet gun is a very good product . it works very well . just don t forget to take the shaft of the rivet out of the gun after you use it . just turn it upside down and it will fall out .
i bought this co sleeper to use when my baby outgrows the by your side sleeper which will be very soon . i was looking for something safe to put baby in to cosleep . the by your side sleeper was great to use for the newborn stage and to have baby safely right in bed with you . but i needed something bigger and the arm s reach co sleeper was the answer . i have it set up in co sleeper mode but i don t have it attached to the bed yet . i am currently using it as a changing table to get baby used to it so i can hopefully transition easier soon . the co sleeper is a nice size and i like that it has mesh all around the mattress area on the liner for breath ability . i also love that the co sleeper turns into a playard so i can use it after outgrows co sleeper . it s a great value . it s a in deal for me extra changing table so i don t have to go to baby s room for diaper changes in middle of night co sleeper soon and then playard .i did buy extra things for the co sleeper .i had to buy thearm s reach co sleeper bassinet leg extension kit naturalsince we have a high bed with a pillow top mattress . i haven t put them on since i haven t attached to bed yet .i boughtcontinental quilting quilted waterproof multi use padfor extra cushion on top of the mattress pad and it will also absorb any leaks that might happen . it fits the co sleeper great and covers the whole mattress pad .i also boughtamerican baby company organic interlock pack n play sheetsince i wanted a nicer softer sheet . it fits the co sleeper perfectly and its super soft .we bought this because we loved the idea of having our baby be able to sleep next to us in bed without the dangers of being in the same bed . this co sleeper allows me to see and rub him if i need to without getting out of bed . the bassinet just seemed akward next to the bed . the co sleeper has a siderail that can be lowered so it almost feels like your baby is in bed with you but it s much safer . at first it was hard to put up down and we thought it was broken but once you figure out how to work it it s easy . i think whether you buy the mini or regular size just depends on personal preference or room size . i purchased the mini because i didn t think we would have our baby in it for very long and the mini would be big enough to serve it s purpose but my son is months old and although he doesn t sleep in it he still likes to sit in it next to our bed . the sheets are expensive . but i bought the koala cradle bassinet sheets from babies r us for . each and they fit perfect ! i m so happy with this purchase and can t imagine what i would have done without it .first this product does not ship apo fpo through amazon which it states it does . we had to order this from an external website in order to get it shipped . i don t understand why other places can ship this apo fpo without a problem but amazon won t .second we like that the co sleeper fits into our bedroom and does great next to the bed . however we had to make several adjustments for our fussy baby . our first adjustment was to buy a different sheet . we got an eddie bauer padded sheet which was suggested by another reviewer . otherwise the mattress is incredibly hard and our baby hates it . our second adjustment was to level off the mattress with some padding underneath . the co sleeper will bow in the middle and our baby rolls towards one end of the co sleeper much to our chagrin ! my husband stacked a few towels underneath to not only fix the bow in the middle but to slightly raise one end of the co sleeper mattress so our baby s head was slightly elevated while we slept .this co sleeper does not allow you to tuck anything into it s mattress but we got around that by using a miracle blanket to swaddle our baby with . since he s a tiny newborn we will have to wait until he s bigger to use a sleep sack with . although in the end he prefers to sleep in the graco s pack n play napper at the moment . he ll reluctantly sleep in the co sleeper .the pros of this product are size fits in our bedroom can place next to the bed easy to move around it s not heavy at all and you don t have to bend over to pick the baby out of .we just needed to make some small adjustments to this product and we re sure our baby will eventually get used to it as he grows but right now it s not the best .
please note this review is for people who are buying this gate for your typical standard bedroom doorway which should measure about across .i have this gate purchased at local store and another gate i purchased from amazon . both are great gates and even though they are different brands they are nearly identical in parts mechanics etc .even without the optional mounting cups which can be screwed into the wall for extra security this gate is very sturdy and should be able to stand up to your typical year old i said typical i know there are exceptions ! ! . to open the gate you have to press the top button and lift up quite a bit i am not so sure a year old would be able to figure that out . the gate stands about tall so an average toddler would be able to touch the top of the gate with their hand .i like this gate but if you are only looking to gate off a bedroom doorway there is a cheaper better alternative the other gate i own dreambaby extra tall swing closed safety gate whitethis gate is normally around cheaper than the summer infant gate and is about taller ! but the dreambaby gate can only extend from so is only good for a bedroom doorway or narrow hallway . the summer infant gate comes with two extension pieces .both gates are good i would be happy with either !the gate is decent construction and the lever has enough weight where only an adult can open it . the mounts aren t sturdy .this gate only fits in our doorways and this is with the extensions maxed out to their maximum length . this doesn t make for a secure fit in our doorways and it is unusable anywhere else . it s too small . it fits soundly in doors less than in width so measure your doorway before you buy .the mounts do not securely fasten onto the gate so when you move it from doorway to doorway or when installing these fall out of the gate and you have to balance these during installation .yes there are extensions available but these are sold as an accessory and with the combined cost there are other better options available .i don t recommend this product as we replaced it with a simpler lower cost solution . save yourself .this gate works great ! we plan on buying another ! although it is pricy compared to those others out there you get what you pay for a grand gate that is true to it s name very tall and very secure ! i love it . it was easy to install and i love that you can use it either as a pressurized gate or install it as a permanent gate . we have it installed permanently to our nursery s doorway and plan on getting another to use as a pressurized gate to move it to other areas as needed in elsewhere in our house . it also comes with the extension parts if you have large doorway others i learned you had to purchase separately ! .we also have large dog lb lab . our other pressurized gate was shorter and did little to hold her weight when she would stand on it with her front legs . i can t remember the brand but it was about . with a plastic grill and center arm that extended . the sure secure gate holds the weight of our dog and is too tall for her jump over .
what a pain to to remove the cover and does not fit some plug types . only the smallest plugs will work like lamp plugs not not thick cords like computer plugs . xbox ps etc are out of of the question . you can replace computer cables with thinner lower grade cables to get around this .this is challenging to get open and closed for the adult in the equation . there are a series of little pegs that must fit into little holes to get it to latch . but they are quite challenging to get to line up correctly and heaven forbid you need to get it back open . now you would think that that s the point of the power strip cover right ? except the hole that allows the cords to come out the top is so wide that my month old just sticks his hand right inside and can put a finger in the socket . it does come w a couple outlet plugs for the extra slots in your power strip i was just hoping this would work a wee bit better . if all you really need is to prevent your child from unplugging things from your power strip than this will work for you .this thing works but it s very tricky getting off . if you work it a little you figure out how it will just pop off . don t get discouraged like i did . work it gently and it will come off easy with a little presure . does not fit a bulky box plug in head only standard ones like a lamp .
hope this helps i bought these for my chevy suburban x . liter . fits great and i m sure the truck is loving them ! ! almost miles on this suburban heck if a truck ! !my parent s suv is five years old now and anything can go wrong with the battery . initially i never really wanted to buy a portable jumper because they were all too big and expensive and the small ones looked clumsy . i stumbled upon this one and i knew just by looking at it that it would satisfy our needs .the jnc xl is very sleek it s small and built like a tank . it s heavy about pounds . i have the nice little trunk bag from . . . and this fits in there with their portable air compressor very snug at that . one time we were at the airport and my dad left the lights on and we were stuck in the parking lot with a dead car in a creepy area . luckily for us we were parked away from other cars and a nice person helped us out with a jump . i don t think we might be as lucky next time . when a situation like that arises you wish you had something like this . again i m not for carrying a bulky jump starter because i don t like my trunk cluttered with stuff . the jnc xl is just the right size to carry in a medium sized trunk bag . it just feels right when you hold it .i also like how it has a built in flashlight and you can use the volt outlet to power a dead cell phone or some other volt appliance . the cables are nice and are awg and the clamps are very sturdy . removing the clamps requires a little bit of force so keep that in mind if you are not as strong as you used to be or if you have arthritis . griot s garage sells this same item for one hundred dollars under their name . the only difference is they give you a lifetime warranty and their item is red in color . i bought this from another online retailer for fifty eight dollars plus shipping . so do some shopping before you buy it .i m glad i bought this item because even though you won t use it everyday it is a lifesaver when you need it . also you can help your friends and neighbors out when they have battery problems as well . it s a fair price and the quality is outstanding . it s hard to find quality items that last these days . i m very satisfied with this purchase .i love this unit . now i know in detail what s wrong with my car before i take it to the shop . this lessens the opportunity that the shop will try to upsell me on a service that i may not need . i also like the idea of being able to log the issues on my computer . i have used it on a ford f nissan sentra lexus rx and a cadi deville
the title says it all . scotch are great at what they do but they upped the ante by making tape you can write on ! good for making labels .there s not much i can say about a cork board . this one works as advertised and i have no complaints .no much not to like . product is exactly as promised with one great bonus . reinforced tabs . didn t realize how much easier they would make thumbing through a file cabinet these tabs do not bend and when i put them in my bookbag i can already tell they will hold up much better . great product !
i ve been using a dymo labelwriter twin turbo for about three years . i accidentally plugged in the wrong type of ac adapter into my usb hub and poof my printer blew out . so i ordered a new one . i can tell you that for a small home office environment and postage printing this printer will do the trick . the latest software synchronizes with your outlook contacts so it is easy breezy to create address labels for those who are in your outlook address book .i just received my replacement and there s a problem with the installation at least for windows . the disk that comes with the printer installs the software addressing stamps but does not install the driver . if you buy this printer and are running windows here s what you need to do go to dymo s website . . . and click on support drivers downloads . from here you can download the latest software and drivers and you ll be good to go . if this is a first time installation don t plug in the usb printer cable until prompted to do so by the software download .so aside from the installation problem this is a printer you can count on for the long haul provided you don t do something stupid like i did and blow it out with an incorrect ac adapter . lol !after studying the benefits and features of various brands and models of printers and the all in ones i finally chose the hp office jet all in one and am so glad i did !i followed the quick guide to unpack install the paper and ink cartridges . there is one instruction from the guide that i deviated from and i had no problems installing the all in one software the first time . i didn t plug in the printer power cord or the usb cable until the software on screen instructions told me to plug in the usb cable . because i have owned several hp products and sometimes their product software is quirky to download and after reading many reviews telling about downloading problems i took the extra precaution of not powering up the printer period until the software instructions told me to plug in the usb cable .instructions for setting up the all in one in my opinion are very thorough concise and easy to follow . setting the various features for the printer copier fax went smoothly and all three work just fine .this is a great item at a reasonable price . the only negative comments i have to offer are the paper trays and their support seem a little chintzy compared to the older models as the printer is revving up to print it seems much louder than what my older hp printer sounded . these two negatives do not have a thing to do with the quality of product or productivity but i thought i would just mention them .i have had no problems in faxing printing paper jams etc . or copying and would highly recommend the hp !as an added note i have windows xp and used the included xp installation cd but the hp is compatible with windows vista and there is an additional cd included for windows vista users for hp software installation .value performer gets new lookba users may like to know that texas instruments has released a new look ti ba allow me to call it it ba n which may come with just more than cosmetic improvements over the popular ba .improved lcd displayi was able to observed from a short distant away that the lcd display of the ba n is clearer and more contrasty than the orginal ba which i own . ti gets a thumbs up for doing this improvement quietly plus giving a facelift to this already highly regarded value for money business financial electronic calculator .did texas instrument killed some bugs in the ba ?although i have not yet been able to test the ba n ti may have also incorporated some improvements and killed some bugs on the popular ba . it is also probable that some improvements or new functions incorporated on the september released ba professional ba pro may also have been also incorporated into the specs of ba n .i would like to believe that some small but extremely annoying bugs of the original ba has been quietly fixed on the ba n . in particular i wish to see the reset button nuisance which clears all user input formatting on the ba has been done alway with . most users of ba would know that an accident user soft reset would return to the default number of periods per year p y to this would upset the results of many tvm calculations when user has set the p y to to use the calculator in number of periods instead .battery replacement woes on the ba i was not able to exam a unit of the ba n to see if end users would still need a screw driver to unscrew and pry open the ba casing just to replace the cr battery . it would be nice if ti would incorporate a user accessible slide open battery compartment for the ba n or future upgrades of the ba .my recommendationwould be buyers should get hold of the ba n or buy the ba pro if you have a bigger budget . budget conscious users could see that for the price of a ba pro a screw driver and spare batteries new users could afford to purchase for themselves two sets of ba n .an advantage of having a spare ba n set on hand is that users could free themselves from the trouble of carrying a philips screwdriver and replacement lithium batteries to important assignments or to the examination centre .how different does the ba n looks ? i have downloaded the ba n jpeg picture from ti s calculator site and posted it to the amazon s picture gallery .important note i have commented on the ba n as an end user and i don t work for ti hp or any of the manufacturers for the products which i have used reviewed and posted my comments on the pages of amazon .com . it is my pleasure to be able to share my first look at the ba n with you thanks for reading !
it works . it is cheap . it does the job well . a review mentioned it didn t come with batteries . mine came with batteries . i highly recommend it as do all of the other reviews .i don t know why others rated it as a star . it is exactly what it says it is and works fine .does what it says it does just as everyone elses reviews say it does so not a very helpful review here but i had to write something in order to give a rating
it fits perfect on my riding mower . hp b s engine .phram is a excellent quality replacement oil filter for my mower enginethe tool appears to be of average quality . however i returned it to amazon since it did not fit up to a ford taurus flex fuel engine . this type of engine requires a special fitting that this tool does not have .even though amazon says it does not fit my truck it does fit my chevrolet hd crew cab with . l gas engine . i replaced both sensors and harness . both sensors were rough looking and the rear sensor had standing water on it . it was a little bit of a chore to get to them because you have to remove the intake but it was not too bad .
fit my gallon long wide high just right . the two glass pieces came already inserted into the plastic piece that allows the glass to be lifted for feeding . the other extra plastic piece goes onto the rear glass piece in case you have filters in the back and need to cut slots out for them . however i don t use that plastic piece and have a inch and a half space that fits well for my filter and heater . it also comes with an attachable handle that makes it easier to lift the glass .i use the zoo med reptile lamp stand in conjunction with the zoo med mini combo deep dome lamp fixture . it works great and i have had no issues so far over the six months that i have owned it . the bottom of the stand slides right under your reptile terrarium . you can adjust the height of the stand depending on how far or close you want the lamps to your terrarium and it also has places to clamp the lamp cords .i was building up a gallon tank and needed a nice top . these glass tops are the best they stop a ton of evaporation on a bigger tank probably gallons a week . i have covers on my gallon now too . . .love the glass tops . the plastic in the back is nice too it can be cut to fit anything you have in there .
needed a music stand of a certain width to fit in my gig bag . this one fit perfectly . it s adjustable and allows me to fit a clamp on microphone boom arm . saves space at cramped gig sites . don t lose the wing nut though . it tends to fall off since you must completely remove it to break the stand down for transport . not worth lowering to stars though .extremely lightweight compact and portable it folds up really small so that you can carry it in your guitar case gig bag or tuck it in the back of your amp sweet little neck stand . very light weight . folds compact to fit in your guitar s hard case or gig bag . padded to protect guitar neck .
would recommend getting a size smaller than what the sizing chart recommends as i measure aroun my leg as recommended and the chaps were one size too large . . otherwise they are awesome quality and buildthe meter has all the functions you could ask for a multimeter in a compact size . the digits are large for the size of the meter so it s easily readable by middle aged eyes .this is one size fits most . it works on the filter for my volkswagen passat but it s too large to grip the filter on my chevrolet s .
it fits perfect on my riding mower . hp b s engine .phram is a excellent quality replacement oil filter for my mower enginethe tool appears to be of average quality . however i returned it to amazon since it did not fit up to a ford taurus flex fuel engine . this type of engine requires a special fitting that this tool does not have .this is great oil i use rp in all my vehicles from air compressor up to truck . this gear oil works great in my f s front diff .
this is a great product for newborns only . its portable and can be placed anywhere as long as its securely attached . it fits in a large diaper bag and can also be used when traveling as sleeper or portable changing pad . the only shortfall is that the length cannot be adjusted it would be nice if there was a way to adjust the foot barrier at the bottom as the infant grows . otherwise do not think it can be used by babies older than a few weeks .a friend made a changing tray for us that sits on the dresser and i wanted to be able to have wipes and diapers in reach without taking up dresser top . this was the perfect solution . looks sturdy and i think it will really meet our needs ! here s a link to the changing tray . . . very space saver and affordable ! i stacked for newborn size diapers and size diapers and it fits perfectly even when i pull one diaper at a time the other diapers don t slide through it . i can t believe how inexpensive this item is that comes with a great quality . it fits very sturdy at the side of savannah shore changing dresser table . definitely recommend this item if you don t have enough space in your nursery ! ! ! !
both of my twins love this toy ! i really like how you can add subtract the different instruments as the song plays . i did find it interesting that they enjoy one of the songs more than others and will keep pressing the orchestra button until they find the song the like . i think it s a good way to start to introduce them to music .this playmat has become one of several baby items i couldn t live without ! we received this one for our baby shower along with a fischer price mat and our son loves the baby einstein mat and shows little interest in the other one .first up to about weeks of age he would lay under it in the on mode meaning the star played music and lights for about mintues . he would love to stare at it and the toys hanging above him . the only down side is the music and lights didn t last too long and we had to keep reactivating it .once he was about weeks old we switched to using the motion mode meaning he had to hit or kick the toys or bars to get the music and lights to play . we lowered the toys with the extra lincs so they would be within him reach . it s really helping his motor skills develop and he has so much fun . the first time he smiled and laughed was when he was on the mat . he really gets his hands and feet moving to get it activated . it entertains him long enough for me to get a shower dress and dry my hair .the only down side is that it s not very intersting to him for tummy time because he can t pick his head up very far yet . still i wouldn t want to go a day without it !my daughter loves to nap in this bouncer . in fact she s sleeping in it right now ! whenever she is fighting sleep i just put her in here and bounce her to sleep . she loves the vibration but the back massager tickles her so she fusses when i put it on . she also loves the music . everytime i turn it on her eyes get really big and you can tell she s really focusing on the sounds .i do agree with the other people who said that this is not a good bouncer for playing in . the toys that are attached are made of dull colors so i just took them off and put other ones on .
i have owned brother printers forever . i currently have four brother lazer printers and use this toner exclusively . have always been satisfied with print quality and with life of toner .the brother laser printer has served me well since . when print quality indicates i buy a new toner cartridge and receive the effect of a new printer . installation is as easy as adding paper and the genuine brother cartridge fits and functions perfectly .the ink cartridge is o .k . but the epson r printer is a huge ink hog . the epson printer s that use this cartridge should all be recalled .
this product surely protects my leather seats but my car seat seat slides around on the seat when its in place . i m taking mine out of the car today . i ll try it again when my son moves out of the infant carrier and into the big car seat .this car seat base does not work with graco snugride seats . just make sure you order the correct one .we ve had one of these installed on one seat for a few years and the condition of the seat without the seat protector versus the one with the seat protector is obvious . this works .there are two drawbacks however the protector doesn t go high enough up the back . there is still lots of wear on the seat back because of the lack of protection there . this is the biggest disadvantage for me . it makes the seat slipperier . tight installation of the carseat is more difficult to achieve although that may be less problematic with newer carseat latch system . i do have the best method for tightening those seats that still use straps for installation . if you have the captain style chairs install the seat tightly with the chair reclined and then push that seat back up as far as possible and your carseat will not budge not even a millimeter and the slipperiness of the seat protector is moot .
i was so excited to get this for my yo and it is a great toy . . . my yo yo love it . but it has an issue with batteries ! when it arrived with included batteries in a try me box the batteries were dead . it s not being played with at a rate that warrants having to change the batteries once or twice a week . when it begins getting low on power the music sounds warped like an old warped record which is dreadful ! perhaps we got a defective one . i don t know . i hope this isn t happening to others .many different choices of sound . does not run on batteries plug in only . i had half of the sounds stop working after years and using it for all of my son s naps and bedtime . i phoned the company and they sent a new one no questions asked .this works well to keep a baby busy . it s just too bad you can t change the battery . the battery hasn t run out yet though . i did buy this previously for another baby and i don t recall the battery running out for a long time .
plain all white labels easily peel off the main sheet of labels each and onto wherever you want labeled .if you use them for name badges you can remove the badge label with the backing attached by turning the sheet over easy ! so you can organize lay out individual name badges labels .warning each sheet recommends not to apply to leather suede velvet corduroy silk vinyl or plastic .so keep this in mind if you re using for name tags . not every participant will be wearing cotton . i did try them on paper they ll remove some of the paper on fleece they ll remove some fleece fuzz and on vinyl the label lifted right off .they are sturdy and i appreciate they are not pre printed so that i can type print or design .i have found all avery labels to be typically easy to load and use and these were no exception to that rule . what i found to be a particularly nice feature is the fact that you can peel the finished labels off the x sheet to stick to clothing or you can peel an individual label with its backing to clip onto a brochure or package and the recipient can peel off the backing to stick on his clothing later . well conceived !clear cover on the outside inside slips on inside of cover . rings snap open and closed with ease ! perfect for one subject or topic !
this board has sort of an odd hanger . it doesn t operate the way picture or board hangers that i ve used before were made but it s not difficult . usually you attach the hanger to the picture or board and then hang the whole thing on a nail or hook on the wall . with this one you attach the hanger to the wall and then hang the board on the hanger . but as i said it s not difficult . the board seems to be sturdy with an inexpensive but sturdy enough frame . overall it s utilitarian but not ugly and should last well .what a clean look for a cork board . it has a smooth light oak frame and plenty of room for pinning . it came with hanging hooks nails but i choose to use the command brand picture hanging strips . wish the board had come with that type of hanging hardware as i dislike the damage hooks nails do to my walls . also if a couple of push pins had been included that would have been nice .it is not a heavy board so it doesn t take heavy hooks hanging strips to put it up . this will definitely keep my papers where i need them .this cork board is about as simple as you can get but it s exactly what most of us want and need . it s a simple cork board with a lightweight frame around . it s so light i can actually hold it up with only two of the m command sticky strips meant for small hooks . the cork holds pushpins in it very steadily . there is no wobble or pins sliding back out . even when hanging relatively heavy items on the pins scissors several laminated sheets under one pin there is no wobble with the pin in the cork . the cork is thick enough that i can push the pins entirely in . no unnecessary frills and completely functional for anyone that needs a cork board .
i have three extremely large red eared sliders in a gallon tanl . . .so you can imagine . they seem happy and swim a lot when i add this .i love this ! i can throw the ball a good distance which i was unable to do before . i don t have to worry about injuring my shoulder it works great ! i do love the glow in the dark ball i ordered with it .i use this for my russian tortoise along with a dimming clamp lamp . i live in ohio so one day it s degrees the next its . i adjust the temp using the dimmer easily .
the fender mini electric guitar stand is not made for the fender squire mini guitar . the guitar falls through . i will have to buy a differant stand for him rendering this one useless . the fender stand for standard guitars will not work on the size ether .at first it look small for my guitar but it fits perfectly with my epiphone lp les paul electric guitarthis is a great value . i contacted the company for measurements inside the case to see if it would fit an ibanez rg series . it fits perfectly . thank you
these pads are a complete waste of money . i started usinglansinoh disposable nursing pads packwhich are awesome ! but i was hoping that these would work because they are a little cheaper . they might work for you if you have extremely light or practically non existent leakage . but even in that case the absorbent material used in this product performs like a thin circular cotton ball it doesn t draw the moisture away from your skin which was extremely irritating to my skin and made me feel edgy and damp all the time .so here are the cons of this product there is no waterproof backing on these pads which is good for preventing thrush but is bad for holding leaks . my shirt and bra would end up damp anyway . the absorbent material does not draw moisture away from skin . my skin would end up wet and damp and hot . very uncomfortable . i had to change these pads constantly if i wanted to feel dry and comfortable thus removing the whole purpose of replacing a wonderful product lansinoh pads with a terrible but cheaper product . the mesh material that covered the absorbent material is irritating to my skin and would stick to the skin when i removed the pad . the mesh material also allowed fibers through that would stick all over my skin which would then end up rubbing off on my baby s face . these pads are small but puffy which would often show up in silhouette if wearing even a slightly fitted shirt . first these really do protect bedding against leaks and spills . get the bed sized ones as an under layer which adds cushioning from the plasticky mattresses that are made today layer on the pretty sheets then use a smaller pad under the diaper area . this protects the sheets but the very bottom pad protects your mattress in case a true accident occurs . i must admit that after washing these pads did pill but this did not deteriorate their effectiveness . i d go to target for the softer thinner prettier and just as effective smaller size . it s the difference between wearing a hospital pad versus a brand name pad . both work just as well but one is more confortable on the go .wasn t impressed with the avent washable nursing pads for the following reasons material is non absorbant material is not as soft as other options available pads stick to nipples lace on the outside can be seen through bra nursing tank small circle creates a strange raised bump seen from outside
i have large dogs all over lbs and one lb rat terrier mix mutt . the product is great but bad price ! i can buy for at walmart .i have two of these leashes i was so happy with the first one that i bought one for my car . my australian shepherd is lbs so on the low end of the suggested pound limit for large pounds but this size is by no means over kill . the extra length of the foot version gives him some roaming room . the feed out and back is very smooth . i would have liked the black color but the red is manly enough . very satisfied with amazon s shipping and cost .get the large one it s not too large but an appropriate size i would assume after receiving the large one that the small one is quite small . i have a lbs cocker spaniel mix and he loves treats . the quality is great and i have seen at pet stores at a very costly i price .
pros small footprint relatively quiet good quality printouts uses the hp a cartridge this size cartridge is rated for pages vs hp successor cartridges for personal laser printers eg hp a cartridge which is rated for pages refurbished toner cartridges are widely available cons no windows drivers compared to my previous printer samsung ml the prints a lot slower especially noticeable with multi page pdf documents in conclusion this is a good little printer for light occasional use .the hp c platinum th anniversary edition hp cpae is the special commemorative limited edition model and the second official upgrade of the original hp c . the hp c platinum hp cp version . has been improved since its released in . although the hp cpae is based on the hp cp version . it would has its historical place as the th model in the hp c lineage since and may be unofficially designated as hp c platinum version . .first look and feel . hp has showcased this upgrade with an overall quality in both the looks and feel department . the new retro styling and colours of the hp cpae closely resembles the exterior of the silver plated hp c a made in the s hp scientific calculator cousin of the gold hp c . as a bonus hp had made this a special purchase for the fans and new owners by including a nice black th anniversary pda style leather pouch with the hp cpae . the overall construction is firm and solid and the improved keypad buttons has a very nice tactile feel indeed .for better viewing users can now adjust the contrast of the clear lcd display screen .what s new ? since the hp cpae is faithfully and conservatively built on the time proven functionality of the hp c existing users should not expect to see any major hardware and software improvements . however it is evident that hp had listened to its customers negative feedback on its first half hearted attempt to upgrade the hp c with the slow hp cp version . released in . hp had dutifully responded to its customers negative feedback on the hp cp v . and and demostrated their wholehearted effort with the hp cpae by incorporating all necessary enhancements which could be possibly squeezed into the package to expand the capabilities of the classic hp c .hardware enhancements . the current upgrade is times faster than the hp c as claimed and probably times faster than its slow early release hp cp when performing certain tvm calculations . the improved speed is now up to par with cheaper products from its competitors . this upgrade has four times more data storage memory which is sufficient for input of up to cashflows or programming steps . with the hp cpae advanced users have a more powerful tool which would enable them to store more keystroke programs into their hp cpae to perform routine complex and customized financial calculations by executing the programs stored in its memory .the hp c niche . potential new users of hp c series of financial calculators should be aware that the proven form factor of the hp cpae is quite a novelty product to get used to . despite the age of its design if new users are looking for the unique rpn input method and user programming capability the hp c series and the hp b series are the only choices available .against the competition . it is difficult to compare the user programmable hp c series against offerings by other manufacturers simply because no hp rivals has ever managed to produce an equivalent product to challenge the hp c series . advanced power users of financial calculators would appreciate that complex financial calculation such as the black scholes european option pricing model formula could be keystroke programmed and stored into any hp c series . hp c hp cp versions . . and hp cpae users could recall the program from memory to perform routine computations repeatedly .who should buy it ? a fan of the hp c with some spare cash on hand would probably grab a hp cpae off the retail shelf without thinking too hard . from my personal experience new users to the hp c series would find that the hp c actually glows on you and grows with you once you are familar with it .would it become a collector s item ? savvy consumers should know that the hp cpae is mass produced and sold worldwide as a mainstream consumer product . imho the hp cpae would have to be made with real titanium platinum or gold plated parts and engraved with unique serial numbers if it were to qualify as a rare collector s item . only time and actual hp sales quantity would determine if any collector speculator would profit from an auction sale of a new and sealed hp cpae on e bay .would i recommend it ? yes definitely . by improving the on the hp c hp has again demonstrated in the hp cpae and hp cp version . that with the right effort even a good product design can be improved upon at the matured stage of its product life cycle . now there is a real rival for the much loved classic hp c and it is no other than its successor the hp cpae . realistically it is difficult to keep improving a near perfect product such as the iconic hp c . judging by the high industry standard it has set the hp c would probably celebrate its th anniversary in .thank you for reading my enduser review hope it is useful to you .who would buy this ? the texas instruments business analyst ii plus professional ba pro is the latest business calculator which would appeal to the demanding business user who wants features functionality solid construction and a calculator which has a really professional look .what s new ? compared to the ba this more expensive ba pro upgrade offers several new functions like mirr nfv modified duration payback discounted payback .my first out of the box impression of the ba pro is its large clear and contrasty monochrome lcd display screen this is a nice improvement over the ti ba ii plus ba .the ba pro is quite nice to hold it feels heavy and looks as solidly constructed as the hp c it would not slip on the desktop when user press the buttons and facilitates one or two index finger s operation . in contrast most ba users would have to hold the calculator on one hand while operating the calculator with the other .the buttons on the ba pro are harder than its predecessor the ba . users who are accustomed to the soft touch ba buttons will notice the difference . however seasoned hp c users would welcome the same firm touch buttons on the ba pro which is as tactile as the keys on their hp c .unlike the ba battery replacement on the ba pro is convenient its sliding battery compartment is user accessible without the need for a screwdriver to open the casing .with its contemporary design and its manufacturer supplied soft accessory leather like case the professional look of the ba pro appeals strongly to the fashion conscious users .how does it rank against its competitors ? i have recently purchased the ba pro to complement my hewett packard c hp c for my studies and professional examination .the newbie speed demon ba pro surpasses the hp c in processing speed for tvm calculations and its excellent user friendly statistical worksheets plus many more added functions but it still not a comparable user programmable upgrade versus the hp c cplatinum .both my hp c and the state of the art ba pro are great complements to each other . however i would suggest to prospective users who intend to own and use both the ba pro and the hp c to do so only if they are not confused by the functions feel and the handling of the two different software and hardware form factor .the ba pro is also smartly priced between the economically priced ba and the more expensive hp c c platinum .judging by the excellent work done on their ba pro ti seems capable to offer a highly specialized user expandable equation solver financial calculator which could rival the hp bii or hp bii series imho .although ba pro users cannot program the ba pro to solve and find the price of a european call option using black scholes option pricing model but for a newbie the ba pro is already the deepest in the money financial calculator in its category .my recommendation for would be owner of financial calculator who has a usd budget time and patience to learn only one business calculator the ba pro should be your best informed choice .thank you for reading my user experience with the ba pro .
this gator case is very good i m use with a fender stratto and it is fit perfectly on this one .does what it says it will do and it does it very well . the connector is a in female slot so make sure whatever it is you re buying can connect to that . the mic boom stand i bought and the on desk stand were both in male so i had to buy cheap adapters each . i also am having some issues really locking in the audio technica condenser mic to the shock mount . so far it stays in but isn t super secure wobbles just a little if it s moved but maybe i m just doing it wrong . aside from that though great product .very good sound and quality . i am not a professional guitarist so these cables will do just fine for me .
this sunshade is easy to use and folds up to a nice compact size that fits under my seat well . it s a quite large size so is made for an suv or car that has a large windshield like my toyota prius . while it doesn t fit the prius perfectly it s the closest size to being perfect .at this price i have no complaints with this and can recommend it .works great . fairly easy swap . just be aware the front window regulators are the same on whether you have a suburban or tahoe or one of their gm family members . not so for the rear regulators . the full size suvs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones . the vehicle input feature amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference . the pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at but the vehicle id feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit . beware ! ! ! ! just so you know the dorman and fit the full size and the and fit the tahoe size vehicles .great fit
i had been using an hp business inkjet printer and hp photo paper for a long time . i thought the prints were pretty good from the hp inkjet printer until i recently bought a canon photo inkjet printer and some canon photo paper with the canon printer .to make a long story short the hp photo paper whether used in my hp inkjet printer or my new canon inkjet printer is trash next to this canon photo paper . the hp paper takes far too long to dry and ink pools on it for a long time . this canon photo paper has a much nicer finish and the print quality seems much better to me on top of the fact that ink does not pool on it and it dries much faster than the hp paper .after trying this good canon photo paper i actually tossed out my remaining hp paper never to use it again . i had trouble with every hp printer i d ever bought laser printers and inkjet printer and hp photo paper is trash next to this canon photo paper . i definitely recommend this canon photo paper .i also tried some canon photo paper plus glossy ii and found that it has a slight orange peel texture to the surface of it and doesn t seem quite as glossy as this canon photo paper glossy .i ve tried replacement inks and they are all awful . my canon prints beautifully and use ink better than most ink jet printers i have two i and mp as well as several epsons and had hps but no more i print a lot of photos and my canons print the best on plain paper of any ink jet i ve ever used as long as i stick with the canon inks . i m lucky i didn t destroy my printer with those cheap generic refills .i ve been a user of epson glossy photo papers for over a decade . i ve never had a problem with them . colors are brilliant and don t fade . granted some of that is ink performance but the paper clearly lets the ink succeed ! if you have an epson printer and are using epson ink look no further !
growing up i always remembered my dad s two multi drawer storage cabinets and how he had thousands of screws nuts bolts washers and odds and ends in them . whenever we were working on a project or fixing something he d be able to tell me i need a machine bolt and i just grabbed the appropriately labeled drawer out of the cabinet and bring it to him .now that i have a house of my own i need a couple of these . one of my drawers had been filling up in the past year with tons of extra fasteners washers and odds and ends and i found myself sometimes buying more of a fastener i already had simply because it was difficult to sift through all the little baggies to find the fastener i needed .so i bought two of these stack on cabinets knowing they don t have dividers or labels in the box and got out my trusty p touch label maker . i put all my bits and pieces in different drawers labeling each one as i went and i can now find exactly what i m looking for when i need it ! stability ease of use at first i feared the all plastic construction would make drawers hard to use and before i had anything in the drawers they would slide or shift way too easily even if i just bumped the table the cabinet was placed on . however once i loaded all the drawers they were much more stable and the entire cabinet didn t move when the table was bumped . durability the construction of this cabinet is the same as my dad s old cabinet but his had a metal frame meaning it ll probably last through another century or two . the plastic used here may warp over time or become brittle so i m not expecting a century of use but it seems to be holding up well to pretty heavy use so far . the drawer guides are simple and allow for easy drawer removal just pull out then pull up the front of the drawer . size of drawers as you can tell by the picture the drawers are either small good for maybe red wire nuts or a couple hundred small screws or medium size good for a few locks some extra hardware from cabinetry or some outlets and switches . since i m storing mostly little things bolts screws nuts washers wire nuts electrical connectors etc . the drawers are the perfect size for me and the clear face of the drawers lets me attach a small label and still see through to what s inside .overall a great organizer for the price there are better options on amazon and elsewhere but nowhere near this price .it is seldom that we get a chance to use such a diverse piece of handy equipment and this whitmor supreme cart is simply the most versatile helper i have found in years . it is well made sturdy easy to use and stores almost anywhere there is sufficient space .while just recently constructing a much larger shelf system that provided the opportunity to spout some awful words this tool it really is like a tool was a snap to put together . the instructions were adequate and with a little pre reading and thoughtful re reading of the instructions it came together in less than minutes . it would have taken less time had i not had the assistance of our puppy inspecting each and every move while attempting to assist . before i forget let me remind anyone buying one of these that a key missing part of my instructions did not include listen for the click or some other form of assistance when snapping two black shelf holders . it takes shelf holders for each shelf and had i not placed a pair on each corner s indented part of the rail and did not hear that click when the holder was seated properly the shelf would not stay put . i wish i could have worded that better but then again i wish for other things that do not happen . take the two black pieces and just fiddle with them on the rod and move it around until you hear the click . no click ? do not use until you hear it . the click is the key . whew . hush . because i wanted the locking wheels on the front of the cart i placed a piece of bright tape so i only had one choice . it was somewhat embarassing to put the locking wheels on opposite corners . by now if anyone has read this far these are such minor comments they barely deserve space however if one person is assisted i m happy just as i am with the cart . it is handy and useful or a combination of values that we seldom receive in one unit .i highly recommend this cart and will add to my cart kingdom with another one later .i read the reviews on rubbermaid storage and sure glad i did buy that junk . this is made pretty good . it has a foot latch on the bottom and a place for a lock on the top of the doors . i m not sure yet if anyone makes a lock that will fit it though . ordinary padlocks won t work . you may be able to find a long hasp lock that will fit . i have two split rings and a small lock on it right now . not much security but it keeps honest people out . i have it on my newly built patio and i attached x s to the wall and screwed the cabinet to them . so at least someone can t walk away with it .you need to get some small screws and nuts to hold it together . it pretty flimsy but is okay when you add your own screws . nothing like rubbermaids junk though . there are no black holes or other items in the nightmare reviews like those on rubbermaid . i m an aerospace design engineer so i see plenty of design features that could be better . but for the i paid for it and a few screws it s okay .
 . . .fits my chevy gmc x steering wheel perfect . stretch it over the wheel and wrap the vinyl string around it nice and tight . the vinyl will break so just stretch it a little .fits on my hi lift jack just fine . does exactly what it is supposed to do .if you are using it on wheels that are deep make sure the straps are long enough to reach the spoke pattern .a regular mm socket will not fit in the space of my equinox . this is a kind of shorter mm socket designed only for oil filter cap job . it works fine .
pros battery driven flashing or steady light flameless flare can be used as a map light reusable . could be used effectively as a light that does not seriously degrade night vision .cons product claims to be visible at ft but this is only possible within a few degrees of view . one half of the top lights up for a dim presentation but the bright led shines out through a narrow beam like a small red flashlight . consequently the flare would probably not be useful in a traffic situation since it would have to be precisely aligned with oncoming traffic and would only be visible by the few drivers within this narrow beam of light . it is certainly not a good substitute for a real flare which is much brighter and omnidirectional . this little light is not as good as the emergency flashers built into vehicles .if you want a safety flare to carry in your vehicle buy the real thing . if you want a light you can use as a map light without distracting a driver or to see where you re walking without seriously degrading your night vision this red light will do that well .i installed these on my gmc envoy xl with brush guard and they work and look great . they really light up the offroad trails and remote roads at night . i used to have the very large hella offroad lights and these are just as bright .installation is no more or less difficult than other lights . there s no magic here you have to run v and ground to the lights the relay to the battery etc .i replaced my stock h bulb in my honda goldwing with this bulb . it is a nice light that seems to light up the road better . i have silverstar lamps in all my cars too .
my dog loves stewart freeze dried treats . the packaging it comes in is reliable and it preserves the freshness of the food . it comes in a big container and there are a lot of treats in there . will be buying more soon !my dogs dachshunds a chihuahua and french bulldog love redbarn beef dog food roll . and i love feeding it to them and here s why it is made in the usa and contains no corn or soy . the lamb and rice flavor is wheat free as well . dogs can have or develop allergies to corn soy or wheat . it is cooked in the casing for less nutrient loss and specially prepared and packaged without oxygen so that it will remain fresh at room temperature without the use of artificial preservatives such as bha bht or ethoxyquin . it is digestible which means less dog poo and fewer cleanups . it is a complete and balanced meal but it can also serve as a protein supplement when mixed with dry food . when cut in cubes they make wonderful treats and training aids yes dogs find them that yummy . in a pinch when i am out of greenies pill pockets a cubed piece can even be used to hide pet medications .once you have sliced open the roll you must seal and refrigerate the unused portion . i usually cut the entire roll into slices and then cube the slices . a cubed roll fits perfectly in arubbermaid cup containerfor storage in the refrigerator .additional information you might find useful the redbarn manufacturing plant is located in great bend ks and their corporate offices are located in long beach ca .shelf life months . can be frozen for longer storage .redbarn beef food roll ingredients beef beef lungs beef liver wheat flour following ingredients account for egg product sucrose flax seed salt dicalcium phosphate natural smoke flavor calcium chloride sunflower oil dextrose citric acid potassium chloride choline chloride rosemary dl alpha tocopherol acetate iron sulfate selenium supplement zinc oxide copper sulfate vitamin b supplement niacin calcium pantothenate manganous oxide vitamin a acetate thiamine mononitrate riboflavin supplement d activated animal sterol source of vitamin d ethylene diamine dihydriodide pyridoxine hydrochloride folic acid supplementguaranteed analysis crude protein min crude fat min crude fiber max . moisture max crude ash max calcium min . phosphorous min . amount to feed inches per day dogs weighing less than lbs feed to per day dogs weighing lbs feed to per day dogs weighing lbs feed to per day dogs weighing lbs feed to per daycalories . per oz slice equals approximately oz with six feline companions these larger cans offer the economy that allows us to afford the best grain free foods for our family . this is just one of the varieties offered in . ounce cans of pure goodness .
this is a very handy item to have when you need to connect your guitar effects with power . its easy to install and keeps things simple . no more extra messy cabling . glad i got it . thanks to amazon for the quick delivery .i was wandering how to make easy do quick release strap from my guitar . i did see this device on amazon .com and i decide to buy and try one . i was pleasantly surprised with this guitar quick release system is working good with my acoustic guitar . and because of that i did purchase more for my other guitar and for my friend one .the tuner i choose is very easy to use simple and small . good for people who don t have time and patience for to conect cables to tune the instrument . i recomend it .
i received this item at my baby shower and we still have it . the doors keep falling off it fills up fast . my daughter who s into everything have learned how to open the top and remove all the diapers . she know that the door doesn t close and falls apart so she s always where the plastic bag is . we had to put kidco locks on the top to keep the top from opening and another lock on the door because when we would open it it would come out of it s holders . sure this is a nice pail to keep after the diapers are gone . but when it has some stinky diapers in it it stinks and so does her room . i have to put air freshners inside it to help with the odor .not a great pail it doesn t cost cheap but it s made cheap .this device keeps the oven shut despite my toddler hanging off the oven handle fortunately phew ! . i tried a different lock prior to this one which i returned as the lock kept flopping down inside the oven whenever open . this one does not have that problem . it is easy to install and works in areas with tight clearance too .the product as promised keeps the wipes warm . but there is a problem with the warmer the lids keeps popping up and doesn t stay closed . since the lids always opens on its own i have drives bunch of packages of wipes !because of the problem with self opening lid i wouldn t recommend this product !
if you are planning even one long trip with your new little one you ll be glad you have this but try it out before you go . it does take a long time to warm up a bottle with this so you do have to anticipate the need for a bottle . the smaller the bottle the faster the formula will warm up . it s a good idea to try it out before you travel so you know how long it will take . one use will pay for itself !this is an awesome product ! once you get used to using this product it is a huge timesaver . it took us three tries to get the amount of water right so the bottle would be the right temperature not too hot not too cold . before going to bed every night we put two bottles and the ice pack in the cooler section . when the baby woke up we transferred one bottle to the warmer . it was usually done warming before we finished changing a diaper ! you may want to order an additional ice pack so you ll always have one ready in the freezer . this bottle cooler warmer makes it easier at night when you want to get back to sleep as soon as possible !great product . i use it at nights . it is a lifesaver when my son wakes up and needs his expressed milk instantly . having the chiller compartment saves me the trip to the refrigerator . sometimes i forget the ice pack and will use a ziploc bag with crushed ice as an alternate . as soon as i pop it in the chamber by the time i am done changing him it is ready to go . i agree the measuring water is confusing so i just check it periodically to ensure the bottle doesn t overheat . one thing to note is that it heats up glass bottles super fast vs . the plastic bottles . so if you need speedy turnaround use the evenflo glass bottles they heat up in under minutes !
i found myself in the need of a competent scale to accurately measure items so i can sell them on . . . well let s just say it rhymes with rebay . i come from a generation when scales had springs in them so i was kind of leery about a scale that i could weigh an ounce and also several dozen pounds . i said that must be one heck of a spring . well scales don t use springs anymore i guess they use some sort of measurement from the flex of dissimilar metals or what have you . anyway this scale measures in pounds pounds and ounces ounces grams and kilograms . it makes it really easy to accurately weigh items to sell on . . . well you know . one great feature about this scale is that the front panel can be removed and pulled towards you on a coiled cord so that you can see the measurement of large boxes . i ve needed that option occasionally . most of the things i weigh are less than five pounds but i got the pound scale in case i needed that capability such as to weigh our cat or something . not that i have a lb cat but if i wanted to weigh something substantial at least i have that capability . bottom line if you re looking for a scale to help you weigh things to sell on blah blah bay look no further than this fine product .i chose this because of the price . i needed a postage scale . it is nice because it weighs up to lbs and down to ounces . mine came with the ac adapter . you will want one because it uses c batteries which are expensive . the detachable face is handy because large packages would make it impossible to see the weight . it seemed easy to read and consistent .the problemthe weight is heavy by about or . that can mean a lot of excess charges when you print your own shipping labels relying in this scale . if you never checked you will never know . weigh a lb bag of flour and see . once you know then you can do the math every time you ship something . it can be calibrated which requires a kg weight or lbs . oz in the usa . the instructions suggest that you calibrate it before sending in for service or warranty . i will report back when i find a weight combination and try calibration . once calibrated it could be a very nice scale for the money . not before though .great product as i need the weight for shipping all sorts of stuff . and the pound range is rather high for this type of device . the price was right and it was exactly as advertised .
the stool can be adjusted to two heights . it also stores alot of toiletries . i would recommend this .this is a great product for newborns only . its portable and can be placed anywhere as long as its securely attached . it fits in a large diaper bag and can also be used when traveling as sleeper or portable changing pad . the only shortfall is that the length cannot be adjusted it would be nice if there was a way to adjust the foot barrier at the bottom as the infant grows . otherwise do not think it can be used by babies older than a few weeks .it s a very neat high contrast mobile with a lot of different image options but if you have a modern styled crib with a thicker top slat then this thing will not fit . only disappointed they didn t make this item versatile enough for different crib designs .
this expandable file is sturdy and well constructed . it is a perfect size for letter size documents . it is not recommended for legal size documents . they are inches long and will have to be folded to fit . use the longer version of the expanding file for those . back to the matter at hand . . .this file will hold hundreds of pages . it seems quite durable and should last quite a while .excellent little book stand for the desk but will hold a book no more than thick so don t expect it to hold a dictionary . it s made of heavy solid wire and is sturdy and stable . a good value .i love making refrigerator magnets with these sheets they re super easy to use and work very well . they have decently strong magnetic force and can hold a couple of sheets of paper if the finished magnet size is x or larger .
these strings are just prefect and feel awesome . as you can tell from the amount of reviews on this product they are extremely popular . . and all those people cannot be wronggermany company manufacturing is in china . . . i have always found this to make the product hit or miss but the last two behringer products that are in my hands are very good .i prefer shar s overture premieres which are the same price . these ones are a little too bright in sound and not deep or resonant enough . also bear in mind these are not dominants which are clearly far superior but for which you would be paying a set .
mr gasket chrome hex valve stem cap worked fine on my car and look good . i left the valve a little loose and put the cap on to see if the cap would seal off the leak and it did . great .this is absolutely one of the best oil filters for the price all metal end caps and silicone valves . it help them run longer . also has a grip to hand tighten the filter . used on a p crown victoria and works great with synthetic oil .this tool is perfect for solo bleeding brakes . all you do is attach it to a bottle jar container via some adapters and tubing and then bleed away without the fear of getting air back into the brake lines .the only tiny problem is that the tubing attached to the bleeder screw is a air tight one way check valve so when you take it off a large amount of brake fluid is trapped on the intake side of the tube and if your not careful may make quite a mess on the calipher . i wish they included some button on the tool to open the check valve fully to allow the excess fluid trapped in the tubing to flow downward into the container to minimize the chances to make a mess .
its working great but it does not work in stereo . it is a mono adapter the stereo adapters are a little more expensive .this product does what it is designed to do very very well . it is not used very often but when it is it works beautifully .this works in some applications but doesn t work in many others . even when detected by the software it will not work with line equipment . too bad because it would have been convenient to program my effects with my laptop instead of my desktop .
i use this scanner under os x and with g and have zero problems with it . to be said this scanner is a real workhouse ! in my case it is used in business and it is one very busy scanner with more than four thousand mm transparencies scanned medium format scanned artworks you name it . the dynamic range density coloration and overall image clarity is just above any concerns . this thing delivers ! i got my from local retailer with extended warranty that i never used . i use scanners for at least years and it is by far the best scanner i ever used . if you do photography on any level and you need scan i doubt you will have any problems with this one . so i guess i m one satisfied pro customer .i ve had an hp c ever since they were first available roughly twenty years ago . i m just in the process of buying another one as my original one is finally and completely dead .if you re in any business and have anything to do with money outside of being a cashier this calculator is essential . it includes almost every financial function that you need and quite a few that you probably don t . any problem involving the time value of money or finance is a snap with this mini machine .the only potential problem that i can see for a new user is the rpn format by the way rpn stands for reverse polish notation . it was invented by a polish mathematician jan lukasiewicz for symbolic logic . rpn is different from the traditional method on entering equations into a calculator but is easy to learn and use . . .in fact once you get used to it the traditional way seems very clumsy . for die hards the hp c platinum edition includes both traditional and rpn entry methods and is the one that should be purchased .you can buy pens and lighters from anywhere anybody but bic has a reputation that is second to none but parker or sharpie .but we know what a review is about for the p r i c e . . . you cannot buy a better i n e x p e n s i v e lighter or pen anywhere !
this is a must if you own the hi lift jack . this makes using the jack so much easier in many cicumstances . i bought it to go along with my extreme model for my polaris ranger crew and unfortunately i guess fortunately i have not had the opportinuty to use this attachment on my own rig but have already had the chance to use it to help others ! i love it !i bought this to change the front and rear differential in my toyota tacoma . it was a much better deal to buy in bulk . save yourself some money and do this simple maintanece . i went in with a friend on this pack and we both saved a ton by doing it ourselves . also be sure to buy a pump to easily fill the differentials . a cheap handpump is all you need .good fit be sure to measure your tires for fit . it was a good look in replacement of my old discolored cove . i keep the old one in rv to lay on when i need it . the price is very good . thanks folks
this holds a fairly large bag of dog food enough for two pugs for one month . it fits into a narrow cabinet . very convenient .brush would work well for toy breeds over pounds but it s too large for pound toy poodles in full coats .quality is there in the brush for the money just too large to handle around the small heads and bodies easily .nice little brush perfect for my little pound girl . nice grip for me to hold it comfortably . mimi says woof .
these treats are okay and my dog will eat them . they seem rather hard and it s not a treat he will eat right away . it s more of a save for later type of treat .my dog loves these and so do i . no yucky texture or greasy feel such as with hot dog pieces or cheese pieces and no grossness in your pocket or treat bag . and my dog will do a lot for a taste of these treats .one of my favorite treats for my pup . i always need to cut the chunks into smaller pieces for training treat but it s a great treat .
this is my car safety harness of choice for all three of my dogs . i have a lb mixed bichon lb mini poodle and a lb mini poodle and they all wear size small . they are quite adjustable and work well an extension bought separately so the dogs can stand or lay down with comfort in the back seat of the car . without the extension only my short legged mixed bichon would be comfortable . the poodles have longer legs and would not be comfortable without an extension . tip because they all wear the same size harness but at different adjustments i have a little piece of yarn in different colors for each tied onto the harness so i know at a glance which harness belongs to which dog .perfect . had a smaller size for my macaw . this time bought the lg inch size . this is much better and very sturdy . going to put it in the cage tonight . hope he likes it these are the greatest ball throwers we have found . . we think the inch one handles the best for distance and height !
the fender mini electric guitar stand is not made for the fender squire mini guitar . the guitar falls through . i will have to buy a differant stand for him rendering this one useless . the fender stand for standard guitars will not work on the size ether .this stand is designed to work on electric guitars not acoustic or acoustic electric guitars . the arms that support the guitar are short and not adequate for acoustic guitars . this is however perfect for my lp and sg guitars . i love its size and portability .as a lot of epiphone owners have learned cases designed for the gibson es clones won t fit epiphone guitars as the epiphones have a slightly larger headstock . this case however fits my dot custom like a glove . the padding is perfect the top is arched to precisely fit the guitar and the build quality is better than you might expect at this price level .
does what it does and has what it said .works good so far .buy it when you can have compatible staplersthis expandable file is sturdy and well constructed . it is a perfect size for letter size documents . it is not recommended for legal size documents . they are inches long and will have to be folded to fit . use the longer version of the expanding file for those . back to the matter at hand . . .this file will hold hundreds of pages . it seems quite durable and should last quite a while .i can fit a lot of paper work its perfect if you are a self employed personthe color was a nice touch
i like this . it holds books well . it is holding up well and gets the job done . it is more for books you put would put on a table or desk to read . not for say taking on a bus to read a paperback . the flipklip is great for doing that . this one is more of a i have to type from a textbook onto my computer kind of thing . it holds all books but thick volumes like a dictionary . this one is great for holding a cookbook while you are stirring a pot for learning to type and it holding the book open for hardbacks that you just don t want to hold with your hands and have it hold it open for you things like that .i have used this stand to hold knitting and crocheting books to look at the patterns and also to hold magazines . i have a neck injury and try not to look down at whatever i m reading so this stand works great . the two little legs can be adjusted in or out depending on the size and weight of what s in it . right now i m using it to hold a magazine that i read during breakfast .so far i have hung a few things nothing too heavy and this product works well . it is easy enough to cut and dispense as i need holds steady and firm and did not tear the paper i had it affixed to when i went to move it . it moved cleanly and left no marks . instead of using tacks that leave marks use this product to stick items to surfaces without destroying the surface or the product you are displaying .
these martin strings m aren t bad . they just are not the sound i was looking for . i ended up like the ernie ball earthwood extra light instead . the martin s are little shallow on the low end unlike the ernie ball . other people will love them though . they are easy to play .these are shred picks they are very accurate . pinch harmonics come easily . the point is made to scream over wound strings gallops are a breeze . i gave one to the other guitarist in my band now he only uses them .i love these picks they are my favorite ! i bought a pack of after trying the pack of last year . these picks are sturdy and wont break that easily . i use them for rhythm runs and even lead . they are perfect for rhythm flexible . my only wish is if they had some grip raised end where you hold . for lead these sound dull . i much prefer a brighter more chimey sound .overall great product ! get it . . .
i like this particular type of tab set for several reasons . first of all it is an tab set whereas i usually use a five set . i found this came in handy for a project i was working on . normally i just use two sets but the tabs cover one another . with the tab i can see at a glance which tab i want . also i like the insertable tab dividers so that i can change them out when necessary . the eight colors also help keep papers organized . all in all this is a great set if you are looking at a larger project where you need the increased number of tabs .i am using these products as a work to create a recipe book . i love the fact that the tabs are big and easy to write on with my sharpie . once set they don t smear or smudge . however i can clean them off to make changes fix errors . i also like that i can write on the divider itself in the same way . i have been adding an index on the actual divider in some cases . these work great and the fact that you get sets means you can tackle bigger projects without running out ! i have used sets in my recipe books so far !i wasn t sure i needed nor wanted the easy peel feature . however after mass labeling with more than labels i find the utility in its design . it s only useful when labeling large numbers of envelopes at once but i appreciated the convenience of having all the labels out and ready to go not having to struggle to dig my nail under each on .my initial impression was that these labels were too small . they are large enough to fit the average name and address on three lines in times new roman point type . they don t fit a fourth line even when i tried changing to different typefaces . if you need four lines don t buy this .after using the labels i found the size is actually appealing for my taste . they are clean and simple and look appropriate on letter and business envelopes . larger envelopes or packages may need a more substantial size label . companies that want their label to stand out more may also opt for a larger size .
very good product this brand offers quality products and have bought several for baby products sincerely recommend this brand it is best for babies and childrenmy little one is intrigued by this mobile ! he stares and smiles at it ! i love the variety of colors and prints . i like that it s interchangeable so baby stays entertained . great product for the price !my three month old loves to look at this mobile . she s entranced by the graphic colors and the baby face image . the cards are a little hard to switch around . but it s a great item . other products from this line are also a big hit .
well built meter that functions just as it should . the dials are easy to read and as far as i can tell the meter is accurate .i own both a travel trailer and a sailboat so needed a method to check battery condition as well as charging ability of my truck s system . this unit addresses both needs . i was surprised at how large and heavily constructed it was but am pleased at its obvious durability . there was some confusion on my part initially on how to read one of the scales and feel they could do a little better in explaining that . but it s easy to figure out once connected to a battery . simple and straight forward to use no college degree or inch thick operating manual required . just hook up and read . purchase with confidence .i rated this product stars for quality and ease of use . the scale is easy to read and moves easily and stays where it needs to be after reading the depth .
can t really tell if this is working or not . maybe when i take him to the vetall will be perfect .my dog loves this toy he chewed on it til there was no little bumps left . warning in case you didn t notice in description you don t always get a t rex .but the dogs can t get enough .
my dog was so very sick and as i was about to take him to the er he vomited several pieces of this chew bone . i will add a photo . this could have been a disaster requiring surgery or causing death . please don t buy this . my dog loved it but i should have listened to the other negative reviews . please don t learn the hard way like i did . he s only lbs .ps i have since learned that rawhide treats are no good either the rawhide sits in their stomach taking weeks to digest . the butcher dept in my grocery store sells bone marrow bones . i think it s the cow s femur . i boil it for mins and dogs love it it will keep him busy for hours .update i ve since learned from comments below that dogs have broken their teeth on these bone marrow bones . luckily my dog seems to be over the chewing phase .i am a big fan of treats that are digestable . i purchased this product thinking it would be safe to feed my dog . i left the treat for my dog on my way out the door for work when i arrived home hours later the treat was fully gone and the poor dog could not control his bowel movements and had diarrhea .this diarreha lasted for days and was so bad that i had to take a trip to the vet which ended up being one of the most expensive trips i ve made there yet to have him tested for various illnesses .i didn t attribute the diarrhea to the product at first but a week later i again gave my dog this bone treat and a few hours after eating the bone the diarrhea started back up again .i m unsure what exactly about this product is healthy and would argue against it being edible . sure technically you can give this product to your dog and if he eats peices it won t require surgery to remove . but you ll spend days dealing with uncontrolable doggy bowel movements and excessive dehydration . and if your not quick enough to realize it s this treat causing your problems you ll spend a few hundred bucks at the vets office like i did .and don t get me started on how quickly these things can get eaten . . . .from now on i ll stick with bully sticks .my dog is being treated for a condition that requires me to reduce her exercise level to almost nothing . i m desperately trying to find treats that will keep her quiet and aren t rawhide . the vet told me i shouldn t give me dog rawhide on a daily basis so i decided to try these edible nylabones .my dog loved how these tasted but she finished them in a matter of minutes . the description calls these edible chews so i was expecting these bones to keep my dog occupied . i wouldn t call these bones chewy either . they seem to be slightly tougher than a milkbone but just as dry . i have been a fan of nylabone products for as long as i can remember . i raised all my puppies with nylabones but these edible nylabones don t last long enough .on the plus side my dog did enjoy these treats and they didn t give her an upset stomach she has a pretty tough stomach though .
exactly what i needed to connect distortion paddles to my amp . . .do yourself a favor always order threw amazon dealers ! i placed an order threw onlinecarstereo .com and had to report a scam operation to my credit card co . . . .their customer reviews were terrible yet i made the mistake of placing n order . . .right before my eyes they changed their bad reviews to add good ones . . . .originally received the wrong item but i contacted customer service and they returned my email that night on a sunday and said they would ship out the correct product the next morning . i received the correct item in one day as well as a postage paid envelope to return the incorrect picks . great customer service and love the pics . . .the color in the pictures doesn t do it justice !this product has almost zero documentation in the box or on the akai pro website . technical support is also almost zero . akai seems to not care about getting new users up to speed on their products . customer service is basically if you have to ask you should not buy this . i asked the akai technical department which sequencer software i needed and they told me to go to a music store ! this may sound stupid but unless you have a lot of midi knowledge and experience don t buy this product . try finding a midi tutorial that is usable . good luck with that chore .added nov the keyboard arrived with one of the bottom rubber footpads missing . i sent an email to akai asking for a replacement but they do not have any parts . i find that unbelievable .
this is one of those items you must have . . . .i use it when grocery shopping because realistically you cannot push a shopping cart and a stroller at the same time nor can you really put the baby in the car seat carrier and have room in the cart for items . . . also great for around the house . the price is well worth it !we bought this for attaching to picnic tables when we go camping and it worked very well . we also tried to use it at church but the newer plastic tables are hollow underneath and that made it difficult to get the chair secured . some have mentioned that it does not work with a table with a skirt . as you can see from the picture it does work with a skirt you just have to set the bottom locks into place in front of it . the baby s weight does most of the job of securing the seat to the table so even when we couldn t necessarily tighten down the bottom screws i still felt that she was secure and safe in the chair .what i did not like the carrying bag is too small .the back of the chair is very straight and i felt like she was forced to lean forward in the chair too much .one side on the one i purchased does not fold down very easilywhat i did like priceportabilityease of cleaningoverall i m happy with the chair . it does what i need it to do and is a good product for the price .i think the chair would serve it s purpose for a little while but the way the arms go together and fold for storage travel seemed way too cheap for me . the paint on the metal was scratching off when i twisted the arms to fold it . i only tried it on a counter so i can t say how it works on a table with a skirt but i returned it and spent more money for a better made chair by phil ted called metoo . the phil ted chair folds flatter than this one and is lighter but doesn t come with a travel bag where this one does . i can live without the bag for a chair that seems safer to me . and the metoo chair does go on my table with a skirt .
if used properly this stuff really works . will keep your cat from marking in the same place . seems to work on all types of surfaces . the trick is to apply liberally and let it work before sopping up the excess .works greatworks great . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

i purchased one of these back in for our dog . now i wanted another pressure mounted hands free gate for our toddler and this is the product i immediately thought of purchasing .i was extremely disappointed when i received the gate and realized that there is no longer a ramp to help prevent tripping over the lower bar . i thought that feature was one of the main advantages of the older gate version . why would the manufacturer discontinue that ? surely it would not cost a lot more to include that piece and i think parents would be willing to pay a few extra dollars for added safety .fortunately i was able to find another product that solved the problem for me tee zed dreambaby no trip gate ramp whiteit s not as perfect a fit as the original ramp but it still works very well . kudos to dreambaby for thinking of selling such a product . i wish the first years product manager would reconsider including the ramp with this gate .this is probably the worst product i have ever bought .with two children months apart i knew i d need an installed gate for our ground floor . based on the ratings in consumer reports and the reviews on this website i eagerly purchased two of these to keep the kids in our living room .the instructions were very clear and i was looking forward to installing the gates . i figured it would take time but if i followed all the steps it should be simple . nothing could ve been further from the truth .we used the templates provided by the first years and they were of no use . i ended up drilling and re drilling in all four walls . one wall we had to replaster and i will have to repaint when i have the time .we had to make two trips to home depot to get replacement screws . the heads of the screws provided in the box continued to break whether we used a power screwdriver or tried to install them by hand . fortunately we never had a problem with the home depot screws .please i beg you not to waste your money on this product .this is the second kidco product i have purchased . let me start by saying that their products are some of the safest out there and i have every confidence in the security of the gates i have installed . but the first gate i purchased was the standard gateway that uses hardware to install . you can see my review there but the thing that is pertinent here is that they only included limited hardware in the box which would not work safely if installing the gate into dry wall even when there is a stud . so instead of including another set of screws that would ve cost them about . kidco likes to make busy parents go buy that stuff themselves .well this gate has its own torturous surprise for busy parents who are trying to multitask every hour of the day . kidco kindly includes two extensions making this gate much more versitile than most on the market . the thing they don t tell you is that these extensions are held in by the same tension that holds the gate into the wall . each of these tension screws are completely separate from one another which is good design because it allows installation over uneaven surfaces . however because there is no mechanism holding these extensions into place this means that the parent installing the gate must use two hands to hold up the gate make sure each of the separate extension brackets and two separate support bars and the metal extension bars which the brackets slide over none of which lockinto place in anyway don t fall off all the while trying to tighten one tension screw at a time . . . i cannot even explain to you how two limbs are not enough to get the job done and still remain sane by the end of the process .throw me a bone kidco ! how about the brackets clip or screw that holds the brackets into place so they don t slide off while i m trying to mount the gate ? something ! ? !unfortunately you will find that kidco often makes the best products for this kind of thing but they sure do cut corners on the little stuff that would make a parent s life a lot easier .
i have two battery tenders plus a solar battery tender panel . all are quality items and do their jobs well .i needed this item for an air compressor that draws a and my v socket can only handle a . this item is perfect and small enough to fit in my air compressor s case . it would be nice if we know how many amps it could handle but the wire gauge provided is more than enough for my a need .the battery croaked after years . i just bought the same thing again .it will probably last longer if you follow the instructions . it s apparently a lead acid battery and should always be recharged before it gets too low which i did not do .according to the manual the battery has enough juice to completely inflate car tires or run an watt tv for hours . max output is amps volts .shop around . an orange logo home improvement place sells these for a good price .pros the cc is perfect for tires .the built in pressure gauge and clip on inflation hose make tire inflation a breeze .you re going to waste money on gas unless maintaining your tire pressure is real fast and easy . this unit makes it real fast and easy .it s compact . it has little compartments for all the accessories charger hose volt cord extra fuse etc . the switches and indicator lights are clear sensible and ergonomic . the handle and everything about it is to like .the cigarette lighter socket lets you use it as a volt power supply and also lets you recharge the unit from your car s cigarette lighter . i never used these features . cons it has very low air volume for air mattresses or large beach toys . i wish they had doubled the air volume and maxed the pressure at psi instead of psi .the pressure gauge reads about lbs too high . need to compensate .it s household quality not industrial quality . one of the little compartment covers broke the first day i had it .strangely you are not supposed to use it while plugged in to volt ac .
this little compressor has far exceeded my expectations . i have had two plumbed to an air tank that ran air tools on my rig . they run forever and have never gave me a problem . the only thing i would suggest is to switch out the male hose adaptor . this will allow you to run a regular sized higher quality hose that can attach to regular air tools hoses in a pinch . the one that comes with it is an odd ball size . don t get me wrong . . .you can t run air tools directly from this compressor . but using two into a tank makes it possible . i would buy another one in a heart beat . a little noisy but what compressor isn t ? ! it pushed a decent amount of air for the money . you need one for your vehicle so just buy it .just like fire needs oxygen heat and fuel cars become roadblocks withoug gas battery and air . you can carry more gas and a second battery electrical system but air is hard to find and with service stations removing it from their offerings of yesteryear you need to have your own air system .what impressed me most about this compressor was the attachment point to the valvestem . it is threaded and screws on forming a seal during refil . this seal is exceptional good enough that the guage mounted on the compressor itself is accurate to set your tire pressure at the other end of the hose . if you are filling a big tire it will take some time so this lets you sit back and relax while the motor works . my tire chucks for shop air all require constant finger pressure to ensure a seal not having to get tire chuck thumb was a nice side benefit !as for portable inflation systems i ve grown tired of anything with a cigarette lighter plug as the power source . it s limited to amps which gives you roughly watts of power . would be a full horsepower . this compressor under load can draw amps at v for watts more than a half horsepower . to do that they use clipon cable back to the battery . because i carry a second battery i clip on to it for the juice to run this . it will also work with your main starting battery if you don t have a backup elecrical source .in the box you will find a carrying bag as well as an octogonal shaped piece of plastic thats the air input filter you need to screw it onto the air inlet to protect the compressor . its a quality unit so it needs protection .when all is said and done you have a hp vdc compressor that gives you the freedom to set your tire pressure when and where you want to . with the fast fill rate it takes very little time to top off your tires if you want to drop your pressure for sand offroad and then refill it later when you hit asphalt this is a small but valuable tool to have in your emergency kit .the unit has a well balanced carrying handle to take it between tires and is light weight enough to take with you everywhere . while you can use your car s starting battery a second battery will prevent you from draining your starting battery . when done start up and drive away .if you seriously go offroad consider a highjack lift to get you out of a bind or else a hydraulic system with a portable cylinder fed from your engine s hydraulic pump if yours is equipped with one or a secondary hydraulic system powered by your secondary electrical system with all this you will not be stuck for long !finally maintaining your tire pressure at proper levels for your load optimizes your fuel efficiency at gallon for fuel these days your efforts will pay for themselves shortly .while i have a vac compressor in my shop this is the first honest vdc compressor that does not take forever to fill a tire . with a half horsepower air cooled motor it does the job quite well . it s worth the money to keep onboard .there is no swiveling between the cap the tube and the bottle . in other words when you screw unscrew the cap onto the car s brake fluid container there will be kinking on the tube itself . untangling the kinks is a chore because the bottle is both quite big and heavy when it is filled with brake fluid . they should have designed with some quick connect disconnect like the compressor air hose . that would be an ideal solution but i guess it will add to the cost for adding that feature . however i doubt that it would cost much because i browsed through the air hose connectors at harbor freight and they run typically a couple of bucks each . i might modify this bleeder with the air hose connector to address the problem .
the tape is paper but due to being self stick tape the surface is shinny to the tape does not stock to itself and thus cannot be easily written on which was the purpose for my buying the paper tape . not a manufacturer problem just not what i was expecting for paper tape .its tape !yes this tape does look great when wrapping presents . yes it disappears on gift wrapped surfaces . but that s not all . i use it for my everyday tape as well great for small repairs when you need the tape to not leave a strange matte spot on the surface like regular tape . did your kids rip yet another page in their storybook ? scotch biftwrap tape . did you forget to put something in that pretty mailing envelope ? carefully unseal it and then . . .scotch giftwrap tape . crafts scrapbooking kids projects ? scotch giftwrap tape . i only wish that more tape came on the rolls .
fantastic product . our child loves playing in this pack n play . even if we don t put toys inside the walls are moderately entertaining for our child . the sun has a mirror plastic kind that sort of warps images the butterfly has crinkly wings fabric with plastic inside for noise another side has a bug with wings inside and the final side has a squeaker which is really hard to use .it s all one piece so no assembly ever required . the sides are collapsible with the push of a button on each side . the ground mat that the child sits on servers as the exterior of the case that holds the pole assembly together when folded up . and there s a light plastic zipper bag with handle that serves as a carrying case . it packs up into a long rectangle probably x x feet .pros pack up or unpack in under a minute no assembly required just set it and lock it into place like a collapsible baby stroller . sturdy build child won t be able to tip it over and it would never fold on itself . soft but strong mesh walls that child can see through but can t stick fingers or small objects through mesh .cons this is a minor complaint the squeaker on one of the walls is impossible for a child to squeak you have to press it from both sides of the wall because it s sewn so tightly as a side effect of the sturdiness it s very heavy . on the plus side of that it is made of sturdy materials .it is just what i needed to organize my changer table . be aware that this product is not for a crib or a changer dresser or table top . also the edge of the changer table needs to be less than an inch for it to fit properly .it does its job .some installation tips to make the process easier this is easier if an extra person is available to hold up the other end of the plastic otherwise it tends to fall down making it hard to mark puch holes . i managed to do it myself i first stapled one end to the door frame wall . a regular stapler worked but if your wood is harder you may need a staple gun or just a nail with a large head would likely do . to keep the plastic propped up i used packing tape and taped the top part to the railing . i had to make holes further from the edge than the hole puncher could reach . a drill with a bit was very easy just be careful that the drill bit does not glide along the plastic surface and scratch it . also make sure to drill from the side of the plastic that faces the child so the sharp edges around the hole are on the opposite side .
the snuzzler is the perfect accessory for an infant car seat especially for newborns and preemies . the snuzzler is reversable for summer or winter and is adjustable as the baby grows . whenever the baby outgrows it the baby is probably ready to sit in the infant seat without extra support . this has worked so much better than rolled up towels which are constantly moving . it is also important to note that the snuzzler meets all official flammability requirements . towels do not and are usually cotton which is extremely flamible . it is now months later . we stopped needing the snuzzler in her infant seat at about months old . we had it stored for awhile and then brought it out again to use in her high chair .the first years infant to toddler tub with new born sling is just great . i could not believe looking at it at first whether it would be comfortable for our newborn but the sling is just great and baby loves the warm water and fits comfortably in the sling as mom enjoys bathing her .it is built to place on the middle post or section between a double sink and the tub is rather sturdy when placed on our double sink although like bathing our newborn in a warmer environment than a kitchen . the tub is also not too heavy if you are carting it with enough water for the baby to bathe in . there is a plug at the bottom for easy draining . there are basically three ways to seat a babe . the sling for the new born a more padded seat for an infant to recline in and a more sturdy seat for the toddler to sit up in if you wish to use it .when you think of it for the money this infant to toddler tub will save you in the long run until your little one is ready for the larger tub . great gift idea and should be on every moms registry .the bundle me for toddlers is a great product . we also own the infant bundle me and it was perfect as well for both car seat and stroller . now we got the toddler version and it s pretty long to be able to fit our son until he s much older he s now months and keeps him nice and warm . no need for blankets that fall or fly off . perfect !
this was a product that i used when i worked in child care and i always liked the fact that it is invisible and is not an obvious eye sore on your cabinets . but when i tried to install on my sink cabinet one side worked like a charm and the other side just won t work . i can find no discernible reason for this and it is very frustrating . the two parts line up fine but they won t latch . and the two cabinet sides were installed what seems like identically to me but apparently not . in my opinion it shouldn t be this difficult to make accurate measurements to ensure that the product will work . it might just be my cabinets but they are not anything crazy or out of the ordinary . i am frustrated that i will have to drill more holes into my cabinet and there is no guarantee that it will work !this sounded good in theory but didn t work at all . they were correctly installed by my husband but the magnet is just not strong enough to get it to open . it was a waste of money for our cabinets . it may work if you have the thinner particle board cabinets but it definitely didn t work through our solid wood cabinets .it all depends on your kids if these bottles work for you or not ? if the kids don t like them neither will you
the item came burst open seal broken cap off in the package .rather smelly mess i was able to salvage about half the container left having to throw the rest out as the flakes stuck to the adhesive of the package and also fell over my carpet as i opened the package .i have a kitty that has a hard time with her back legs and sometimes can t get over the other boxes which are higher . she can get in and out of this one being low with no problems . i also only have to use a little of the cat litter so there is no mess over the sides either clumps with no dust through amazon .this mat is large enough to fit under the cat box and still have some left over for my kitty to step on his way out of the box . my only complaint would be that i wished that it came in different colors .
works good installed on my kaw voyager . i installed the unit on the bolt off the left side of radiator box . use the the bracket from orginal horn to make that work sound awesome too .i bought both the driver s and passenger side regulators when i installed factory power windows and mirrors in my sierra . i wanted new parts because i didn t trust the regulators from the donor truck i used for parts to complete this project . the regulators installed perfectly and worked just like they would if my truck came from the factory with power windows .pick up a pair if you are converting your truck over or replacing the factory worn out regulators . you won t be disappointed .almost too bright but i love it . maybe the watt model would be better than these s if your eyes are sensitive to bright lights . exactly what my dodge ram needed because the factory headlights stink . my brights were no brighter than my low beam and my old nissan had brighter brights but these kc watt driving lights solved that problem perfectly . for not being the full long range lights kc offers they sure shine pretty far plus spread the light out to the sides and up into the trees a good long range flood combination . i mounted them to my push brush guard . took about hours to install because i like to route hide and secure the wires very well . i connected the white switch relay hot wire to my high beam brights wire on the drivers side so they go on and off with my high low switch plus i have the master switch mounted without the switch frame near the dash to keep the kc lights off completely if i want . just make sure you dim your lights turn off the kc s before you see anyone ahead of you or you ll blind them and can get a ticket if on a public road . first night i tried them a big point ran across the road in front of me then stopped and pretty much tip toed off the road as if he was totally blind and afraid to move . so beware of animals freezing in front of you with these things . i turned them off and honked so he could run away . and no i don t hunt that way .the wiring diagram on the outside of the box did not show the white power relay wire as if it was pre wired into the main power wire but luckily there was the white power relay wire available to tap into my high beam wire . the wiring diagram on the directions in the box was correct . some vehicles newer than may not allow tapping into the high beam wire because of the vehicle s computer that senses voltage changes but it worked on mine . only thing i had to supply was a sheet metal screw to secure the relay . i cut off about feet of extra wire that went to the switch . the length of wire to the lights was just right .
it s larger than i expected but i will keep it until my son can fit into it . my son is lbs and around inches which is why i bought the large based on the weight recommendation but even the medium is quite large on him right now . would suggest using the height recommendation as a closer indicator of what size to buy rather than weight .do not look at the weight ranges when deciding on a size . my son is at the top end of the size large weight range but this item will still fit him for many months . instead look at the height ranges for a more accurate size determination . my tall son is growing out of size month clothing but the size large sleepsack size months will fit him for many more months .i love halo sleepsacks ! they are the perfect way to keep a baby warm without adding blankets to the crib a sids risk . i have used the sleepsacks for both of my children for a combined total of years . they hold up well in the wash . the zipper works well . when deciding on a size to purchase consider your child s length more than their weight . if they are long and lean consider purchasing a size larger than suggested for their weight . also keep in mind that baby s grow fast . when in doubt buy a size larger than you think you ll need . you can always go back and buy a smaller size then use the larger one in the future .
i like the camco brand . the nice thing about the sidewinder is that you can snap and unsnap parts of it to change the length . it comes with a handle that most of us probably toss away with the box . the handle takes up too much room and is not worth the bother when preparing to move . who wants to wrap your arms around a muddy sewer hose holder to wrestle the handle back on ? i just tuck the holder into a bag for the move .good extension wire to use when you need a little bit more room . i use this on my atv for the batt charger since i put a basket on it . don t have to crawl under to hook it up .gotta have a tow strap on your rzr or atv . not having one is just plain silly . this one fit the bill . i m not a big fan of forged hooks on tow straps . but for my use i think it will be fine as my rzrs don t weigh over lbs . the strap material is nice and heavy . the ft length is nice to have too . i used it the other day to pull my rzr out of a mud bog . no issues what so ever . i hit it with a power sprayer to get the mud off and allowed it to dry . i then rolled it up and put it back on the rzr ready for our next outing . good inexpensive strap .
i use it with an audio technica it work very well the filter stays in place and it really improves the quality of the recording . not much else to say .well like everyone knows this is the copy of the boss but a lot cheaper than that . it works just fine and i m happy with it . anyway if you mean to play at home or in a garage or if you have a band to perform this is a good pedal . if you want more from a pedal the boss is the one you are going to pick but overall you should give this a chance .great for video photo work or even theater . it won t handle well at a large space . if you are a light fog this is the job for almost any situation .what i ll be using it fordj work to show laser beams and light beamsvideo work use it to make a hoax car crash or meteor crash site that s what you are seeing in movies photo work not so much for general photography because it can make people think you shot at too high of an iso .
i love labels or anything that makes life easier . i am very organized both at work and at home . labels make things so much more convenient and quicker .i love these labels . they don t necessarily have to be used with a printer they can be written on . and the reason i say this is because these labels are for laser printers and i have ink jet printers . therefore i can still use these because i can write on them rather than running them through the printer .there are a variety of uses for labels . in addition to addresses files and other office reasons they can be used for jars boxes etc .awesome product .i love sharpie markers in general so i was not surprised to like these too . i like the fact i can control my writing more with these than i can with the regular sharpies . i can also use these in my pazzles inspiration machine which is why i initially purchased these markers . i would buy them again for sure .i love these sheets . i can cut them down to any size i may need . they work great . i don t have the laminating machine so these are what i needed .
what s great about this product is that you can adjust it to anyone s needs . my husband is and big and he can make this work for him to take piggy out for a walk . with just a simple adustment to the strap i can change it to wrap her around me . the best is that as a new born before one can master the art of concealing breast feeding you can use this to hold and feed your little one .this is so perfect in so many ways he can watch tv he can play i can breastfeed him or just take a nappy with me . love it ! this has been my go to for my scheduling of my twins . they are four months old now and i have their care givers fill this in when they can . that way i have an idea of the schedule they are developing . i highly recommend this !
works great with my baritone ukulele . same quality as my full size acoustic guitar capo . easily fits in my ukulele case too .this stand is designed to work on electric guitars not acoustic or acoustic electric guitars . the arms that support the guitar are short and not adequate for acoustic guitars . this is however perfect for my lp and sg guitars . i love its size and portability .at first it look small for my guitar but it fits perfectly with my epiphone lp les paul electric guitar
i have mine attached to one of the support arms on myon stage ks xx pro double x keyboard stand . while this attachment is designed for both square and round tube supports i was unable to use it with anon stage tier folding z keyboard standeven with the top tier removed . the reasons for the problem with the latter stand is the friction fitting on the attachment bar was too small for the oblong support tube and had it mated the height of the attachment bar would not have cleared the top of the keyboard .when attached to theon stage ks xx pro double x keyboard standwith anon stage msa tb adjustable microphone boom blackattached to the top screw in post that perfectly mates with the boom this attachment bar boom combination easily clears the height of either keyboard i use aroland rd nx digital stage pianoor aroland v combo key stage keyboard .bottom line make sure your stand can accommodate this attachment bar according to the manufacturer it will work with most x style stands and carefully measure the height of the top of your keyboard from the center of the support arm to which this attachment bar will be inserted . the total height of the attachment bar after insertion is approximately . . if your keyboard is still too high for the attachment bar boom or other mic holder to clear you can gain an additional with ashure a x mic mount extension tube .works with myon stage ks classic double x keyboard standi got it to attach my mic to it using this stand by on stage as wellon stage msa tb adjustable microphone boom blackworks as advertised . you just twist the knob to apply pressure so it fits in the tube .also comes with the stopper so you can quickly remove this attachment bar and reattach it .this thing is tiny and does not have the breakable swivel head of the original snark . this is the only tuner you need !
great size for someone with a smaller dog and perhaps a smaller stature . i wouldn t recommend this amended size for a tall person .i use this on my teddy bear and it works great and its perfect size for him . definately recommend . and the soft part is greatgreat container but didnt hold my full lb bag but i have three of these and they are overall great . would jut recommend ordering little larger then you think you need .
it is a fender product so it is well made . reasonably priced . it will make any strat or tele build shine .they look slick and work really good i would recommend this to anyone that needs a bass drum patch or sothis is a great effect . awesome engineering as jim dunlop s mxr products has always presented . the true bypass feature and the high end quality materials make it very reliable and dependable . this cae boost pedal is very sensitive and delivers as it should . i actually believe this will exceed all your expectations . you will not be dissappointed at all . ships fast . highly recommended .
measure carefully because i did not . yes the outside measurement of the stand is inches but my laptop is also inches so rather than sitting on the desk below my monitor it sits on the legs of the stand . this means i need to be very careful with the docking station so it seats in properly . but the stand looks nice and will do for now .this is an amazing foot rest . it was easy to set up and changed my situation immediately . while my feet are on this my posture in the chair is improved by sitting all the way back in the seat . i am tall while wearing heels and most office chairs need a lot of adjustment before i can use them . then of course the desk is too high . it took very little setup to put this foot rest to use under my kitchen table which is currently functioning as my office . my office is a mess of work to do and i don t like going in there . it s dangerous . i changed the height setting to the higher setting by unscrewing two thumbscrews and then tightening them and tilting the rest to the angle i like . it was an extremely easy set up .this product makes an immediate difference in the way i sit in my office chair . sitting in the chair incorrectly causes me some lower back pain and neck pain so i try to correct myself whenever i notice it . for some reason it has always been more comfortable for me to sit on the front half of my seat leaving the back half of my chair available for all kinds of pranks and incidences . on an extremely highly polished floor in a classroom my chair once shot out behind me . the worst indignity ? i could have gotten over falling but hitting my chin on my desk and falling on my butt . . .not a good day . and it added to my reputation for being a clutz not that i needed any help . all in all it s probably much safer to properly sit in a chair .the immediate consequence of this foot rest was that i have been much more comfortable sitting at work for long days . my lower back does not hurt and i have not had to get up constantly to walk around or play with my hula hoop . while i am working i am playing around tipping the angle back and forth toes and heels toes and heels which also provides some entertainment .this is heavy and sturdy and seemed like it would stay in place . its only flaw that it does not have non skid below it . this foot rest does shift on wooden floors . my solution for this minor problem was to put a piece of carpet non skid below it . that worked .yes it is still under my kitchen table and it annoys everyone but me . they are currently working on making it fit under my desk because it is about half an inch too wide . in the meantime i am perfectly happy with it . as a computer developer i can spend several hours at my desk working away . but i can t sit still so i find myself changing position frequently . i had been using my speaker as a foot rest but it doesn t change with me at all .this foot rest from m is great . it has plenty of room where i can move my feet around . you can change the tilt easily with your feet . the height adjustment is easily accomplished with a set of wing nuts no tools required . it should last forever it is made from sturdy metal with a nice rubber pad to rest your feet on .it is much more comfortable then my speaker !
very versatile power supply and much cheaper than others . this is not true isolated outputs but it is quiet and that is what counts . i have the fuel tank chameleon and i end up using this because it fits the needs of the pedals on my board the best mainly because of the ma output . here is a comparison of the jp chameleon and the onespot . i have all three .t rex fuel tank chameleon ma outputs v v maoutput v v maoutput v v ma use or only not bothoutput v ac majoyo sp ma outputs v maoutput dc v maximum output of maoutput dc v maoutput dc v mavisual sound onespot ma v only daisy chain power into pedals not exceeding mathis device is a converter that works with rca inputs and outputs . the input seems to be geared for the db range for consumer level audio range . this box also has the ability to monitor the input directly with headphones .arrived on time . . . works as intended and maybe more .one day i was pondering how best to de clutter my wall receptacles from a glut of power adapters and also my table from a spaghetti of ensuing power cords used to feed various v v dc equipment on my table or rack . fortunately i chanced upon this little gem and in an instant . . . my problem was solved . i chose the v adapter with the highest rated power output and used that as my primary v dc source and this little gem to power all the other equipment on the table or rack . i also bought another similar unit form another source here on amazon and used that to supply the v dc source to power the rest of the units that needed a v source . everything worked fine and i relegated the remaining adapters to storage . been working without a problem to this day .
works great . fairly easy swap . just be aware the front window regulators are the same on whether you have a suburban or tahoe or one of their gm family members . not so for the rear regulators . the full size suvs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones . the vehicle input feature amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference . the pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at but the vehicle id feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit . beware ! ! ! ! just so you know the dorman and fit the full size and the and fit the tahoe size vehicles .works just like it needs to . perfect fit for the tailgate on my chevy when the oem clip busted .a regular mm socket will not fit in the space of my equinox . this is a kind of shorter mm socket designed only for oil filter cap job . it works fine .
the pilot g retractable gel ink pen is my favorite for taking notes writing news articles correcting papers teaching and just about anything else you would want . the rubber grip is what makes it allowing you to write for hours without chafing or bruising your fingers on the hard surface of most other writing implements . the gel ink in a replaceable cartridge is solid clear long lasting and rarely fails to leave a mark even on glossy paper surfaces . unlike ball point pens this pen has a substantial feeling to it and rarely fails . it is available in different colors and sizes . overall it s my favorite ink pen for daily use .i really like writing with pilot razor point pens . they write smoothly never get stuck like a ball point can and have a really bold vibrant ink color . because they are more of a marker point pen they are probably not ideal for writing on glossy surfaces as the ink can easily smear in this case . otherwise the pen is versatile durable and useful .all i ask of my gel pens is write a continuous line . do not leave random blank segments in my writings that require others to hieroglyphically decode . and the zebras make the grade .bright colors comfortable to hold and they don t leave gaps nice solid lines of ink . and what s more this does seem to dry unusually quickly so it s smudge resistant . glad i found these !
i love this test kit . i have always had to take water to my area petsmart to have my water tested because i just cannot figure out those little cards that you dip in the water to read the levels . throw them all away and buy this kit . it s foolproof and so easy to use .the charts that you compare the water colors too are very clearly marked and you have no mistake in what you are reading . it tells you exactly how many drops to put in how much water and how long to let it set to read it . the bottles contain enough chemicals to do hundreds of tests . each bottle contains fl oz of test liquid and depending on the test you only use about drops per test . i especially like that all the test bottles and glass vials are in a nice compact case so i don t have all these bottles rattling around the drawer that i keep my aquarium stuff in . and when you do empty one the ones you buy in the store are the exact same size so they fit right into the kit for storage .the written instructions are very clear to understand for testing .works as well if not better than other aquarium water conditioners that i ve tried and with about a fifth of the amount used at a time . doesn t contain any additives that contribute to algae diatom growth unlike api and a few others .tip unless you re changing massive amounts of water at a time get a medicine dropper when using prime i use a . gallon bucket to change water and being able to measure out . ml at a time instead of guessing at how many drops is appropriate is very handy .i didn t realize when i bought this size of a container how big it would be . i forgot how light fish flakes are . when it arrived i figured i would have food for ever but they seem to be making a dent in it already .my fish are thriving off this food .
i ordered one of these for my saturn vue . package marked for vue but item did not work . contacted storefront who fullfilled order for amazon and was referred to curt mfg . to obtain return number . then had to contact seller again . got a refund but i purchased a replacement from a local dealer . seller later reported a wrong item number was somehow in the package .when i ordered this i was guaranteed fitment on a toyota s fe engine . when it arrived it was not the correct size . i left two stars because i did run out and buy the correct size from another store however i didnt want to have to do this when i had all the rest of my parts shipped in .i ordered and paid for next day air because i needed it this weekend . it arrived but it wasn t what i ordered . i ordered a pair of jack stands . i received an engine hoist leveler .i understand mistakes happen . . but it was the way the return has been handled that i have issues with . ups dropped it off but i have to take it to the post office to send it back ? and i wasn t told if they ll wait to ship the right order until they receive this back via the slowest mail service . . so i have no idea when the replacement order will arrive . a week ? two weeks ?this wasn t my mistake or even a defective product . . this was human error on their part . they should have told me they d immediately ship the replacements next day like i ordered . so far i m left hanging . should i go out locally and get what i need and then end up with an extra set ? should i hold off a day because they re coming next day ? i don t know . . and that s the point and that s why i gave them one star .
this stuff is amazing ! currently using in a fluval spec iii . a ml pouch will fit folded in half in the top cut out where the carbon is supposed to go . prior to purigen my water was tea yellow from mopani wood tannins even though i boiled the wood for hours and soaked it for weeks . inserted purigen a few hours later my water was crystal clear . the tank is planted and home to betta and amano shrimp . everything is healthy with no adverse affects .i like that you can regenerate it but note that purigen can become toxic during regeneration if it was previously exposed to slime coat conditioners containing amine . only certain slime coat products will cause purigen to become toxic the products that do this are amine based . seachem prime and safe are not amine based and will not cause this problem . if you re curious what happens is that the amine compounds can strongly bind to the resin then when they the amines come into contact with any chlorine they will form chloramines which are highly toxic . however if you don t plan on reusing the purigen you can continue to use amine based conditioners .they don t call it the master test kit for nothing .if you keep freshwater fish you will need this test kit . it contains all the must know tests to ensure your water quality is up to par for your tropical fish . the importance of a kit like this really shines while you are cycling a tank and it s critical you know how the cycle is progressing . a liquid test kit like this one is far more accurate than using strips and is cheaper in the long run .a brand new aquarium will experience what is called a cycle . fish produce waste in the form of ammonia which is pretty toxic to the fish and has long term health effects and possibly death . bacteria that naturally exists everywhere in the air will enter the tank and feed off the ammonia . the bacteria produce nitrite as a waste and unfortunately this is even more toxic to fish than the original ammonia was . however again there is a natural bacteria in the air that will enter the tank and consume the nitrite and in the process produce nitrate with an a . nitrate again is toxic to fish but they can tolerate it far better than ammonia or nitrite .a tank is fully cycled when both ammonia and nitrite with an i are ppm and you have some reading of nitrate with an a .and this is why this test kit comes in handy it contains tests for ammonia nitrite nitrate ph and high range ph . you ll likely only use one or the other for ph depending on what your tap water is acidic or basic .all of the tests are easy to perform and the kit comes with test tubes allowing you to perform all of the needed tests at once . a word of caution follow the directions closely for the nitrate test it requires you to shake the reagent bottle for a period of time . this is essential for an accurate reading .caution if you use a water conditioner that will also detoxify ammonia for example seachem prime this test kit will still show an ammonia reading . this is because the conditioner converts the ammonia to ammonium a chemical that still contains the ammonia but in a non toxic form to fish .adding this accessory to your aquarium will improve plant growth given already good water conditions .pros easy setupgreat for diyers and experienced hobbyist does not require high pressure of co to be usedyou can actually see the co bubbles reducing in size each one rises through the laddersince this is not a consumable you pay for it only oncefor the price you get resultscons you might have to take it out to clean if it is covered with algaeinefficient there is some waste of co as it is not absorbed by the waternot all plants will display equal rates of growth some species will do well others seemingly unchangedi d recommend it to hobbyists who wanted to see improved plant growth with the use of co .
i have a travel trailer . it has built in jacks at the front and rear total along with the tongue jack but it still tends to bounce no matter how tight you get those jacks .not a major problem but a minor annoyanceso i ordered these . my camper has twin axles and the axles are square . i put these under one of the axles and crank them up as tight as i can . it removes of the bounce in the camper .i recommend these to anyone that wants to use them for this purpose . i suppose you could also use them at the front and back if you don t have built in jacks .our travel trailer w three slideouts has the factory electric stabilizer jacks at the front and back which are great at stabilizing the ends . but in between these over the axles we can feel the trailer flex and slightly bounce especially when we are entertaining have folks congregate in the middle . these work really well when placed just in front of the tires . we simply crank them up snug against the frame rail on each side . now the trailer doesn t bounce or wiggle nearly at all . too bad rv manufacturers on long wheel base units don t add in a third stabilizer in the mid section to keep up down flex movement of leaf springs tires from causing bounce feeling . we also have the bal x jacks between the tires to prevent any roll effect from front to back .i bought a set of these ramps and they flat out don t work on my dodge ram x . in my garage and or on an asphalt parking lot they don t stay put . when i drive up them they slide forward and my truck just scoots them along . i have to hold them in place by using rubber floor mats and or wood stoppers . yes they have the rubber feet on their base but they don t hold . hate them . . . .and wouldn t buy them again . i returned them .
as good as originals at a good price . much better quality than some of the knock offs in the local stores .iridium plugs are worth the few extra dollars . they last longer and perform better !they have also been known to to eliminate low end stumbles deacceleration backfires and similar issues .current price at amazon with free shipping is cheaper than my local motorcycle shop and also cheaper than bike bandit .this is an k and n recharge kit with the aerosol not the pour out style that works easier for the user . great buy for less than what you would pay any where else for the same stuff . well worth the price and shipping and receiving were simple and super fast . thanks again amazon .
we have had a graco quattro and a metrolite stroller and this doesn t fit on either one ! ! it was a complete waste of money ! try it in the store on a stroller like you own before buying !i just bought this toy because it was the only one i could find in the store for a stroller . . and of course it won t fit on our graco stroller .i orginally purchased this stroller because the graco i used with my first child would not fit in the trunk of my new car but this one fit perfect with room to spare and the new car is a mustang . .that s right this stroller fits in the trunk of a sports car . i have never had a problem with it although while i was shopping for it the competetors verson s wheel fell of right there in the store and i put it right back on the shelf after complaining of course . it is sooo light weight and folds down sooo easy . and so many other mothers have eyeballed it and then had to approach me to find out what it was and where i got it so they could go buy one too .i love it so much more than the graco stroller i bought to go with the car seat originally .
i was able to put together one of the four boxes in this pack within minutes just pop out fold over the sides just a bit and there you have your box ! it is very sturdy yet easy to carry though that will change as you add and add and add contents . the handles fold over so they are double thickness as is the bottom of the box . the paper is very easy to write on or to place stickers on whichever method you prefer to use .however this is supposed to have a string and button means of closer and it doesn t it has a fold down lid that fits snuggly on it . while that works great for me it isn t what the product is supposed to be . did they send me the wrong one ?you wont be disappointed in this pen it writes sits in your pocket makes a handy thingy to chew on .each set is individually wrapped and comes in a box you can set on a counter . works great for sleeping ! roll them in your finger push into your ear a little bit and they will expand into your canal .
it holds diapers and the wipe warmer perfectly but the side compartments are relatively small . i can fit a regular size bottle of lotion on one side aveeno baby and a tube of diaper rash cream and small baby power in the other but you can t fit the regular size baby powder vaseline alcohol . . . etc . in the the side compartments .it works really well for me . there s plenty of space for diapers my wipes warmer fits on top and i have odds and ends on the removable side compartments .i have no complaints about this bag at all . i use the small front zippered compartment as my purse and it does have coin compartment credit card slots etc . i love the little clip on the outside . . . i use that for spare pacifiers for quick access . avent bottles and playtex sippy cups fit well in the side pockets . the bottles have to go on the mesh side though . . . that side s slightly larger . the bag is stain resistant and has stayed clean over the past year .
the are great waterproof sturdy mailers with self sealing adhesive . both labels and sharpies work well for addressing them . i ve used with letters books and clothing . they can even work as padded mailers with the addition of bubble wrap protecting the contents .very easy to use and can be used for numerous customized projects cards photos wall clings etc . the paper is sturdy enough that you can layer them for effect embellish punch and cut designs . a great product !unlike some brands where you have to hunt for the perforation to peel the backing off the diagonal backing makes it easy to do this .plain all white labels easily peel off the main sheet of labels each and onto wherever you want labeled .if you use them for name badges you can remove the badge label with the backing attached by turning the sheet over easy ! so you can organize lay out individual name badges labels .warning each sheet recommends not to apply to leather suede velvet corduroy silk vinyl or plastic .so keep this in mind if you re using for name tags . not every participant will be wearing cotton . i did try them on paper they ll remove some of the paper on fleece they ll remove some fleece fuzz and on vinyl the label lifted right off .they are sturdy and i appreciate they are not pre printed so that i can type print or design .
i have a automatic standby generator for my home and in northern michigan the temps can really get extremely low like way below my generator has had trouble starting in these severe climates . the specs call for sae i use this sae and it has no problem firing up in these cold temps .this is one of the better battery chargers out there . why ? because it is temperature compensated . this is important if the battery will be exposed to variations in temperature either hot or cold . other brands offer desulfation and remote temperature sensing which is valuable but this one can be found cheap and gives good performance .this level indicator works great on cool days degrees outside . i use it on the a frame of my foot trailer . on hot days the water inside the level expands to such a degree that the bubble is no longer present . when i first experienced this i thought all the liquid had leaked out . the next morning when it was cool outside the bubble had miraculously reappeared ! as a result i cannot depend on this level to keep my trailer level . it might work if i had not permanently installed it on the a frame kept it cool until i needed to use it but being exposed to the hot utah temperatures makes this level undependable .
this is the same product you can buy in the stores or in your vet s office but at half the price . amazon representatives stated that merial is their direct supplier .this product is a must for all fish geeks great price point ships rite to your door the only saying is i wish prime came in larger bottles at a better price thosefishgeeks .comi received my order today and as other have mentioned there is only one cap although the pictures show a package containing two . i re read the information given and it does not make it clear that there is only one . at that number the price is outrageous . go to a pet store . they are much cheaper there .
i bought this as a present for my daughter to learn guitar on . she absolutely loves it . everyone that has played on it over the past few weeks loves it . you can t beat this for the price ! ! !i am a beginner but i played this guitar non stop since i have bought it and i can honestly say from what i hear from my friends guitars they use it sounds better i did have to tune it tho because it was out of tune and my playing sounded different than the people on youtube i was learning from so i used the snark sn tuner and it sounds great now no complaints here .this was a gift for a friend who is practicing to play the guitar . he has enjoy and likes using the capo .
the text is crisp and the graphics is crisp . . . i can t ask for more . . . maybe just that the printer can include the page toner instead of the one . . . but oh well .if you have paper jam all the time it could be due to the orange thingy in the paper tray . . . . i don t know why but i don t see any paper in the package saying that the orange thingy should be removed . so i had paper jam all the time . after i suspect that the orange things are all supposed to be pulled out then i removed it and then no more paper jam any more !i had a chance to try a pack of these for free and figured what the heck i m always annoyed at having to fill in the return address .i was expecting to have to wrestle with ms word or something to print the labels but actually you can just go to their website which they list on the back of the label sheet . . . . tell it what label sheet you have in this case and it will help you create a design and fill in the information to print and then pop up a webpage and fire up a print job . it was as easy as could be . no download no messing with word or adobe just a website to visit .i did a test sheet on regular paper but it was right on the first try .i see another reviewer complained about the stickiness . i put a couple labels on a sheet of paper pressed them firmly and let them sit for a minute and tried peeling them off . i had to pick at the edges to get it started but then it peeled off without much tearing of the paper underneath so i have to agree that the glue could stand to be stronger . still for regular letter mail i can t imagine them coming off . for packages which i imagine get more friction in the mail i would probably not use these labels .it s ok if you want to trim off some excess . but you have to hold the paper very still or the blade will pull it toward the end of the cut . there is no guide so cutting multiple pieces can be time consuming .i m really disappointed in that if i cut a sheet in half and truly want to use both pieces it partially bends the piece of paper to the right of the blade . i don t like that at all .
the rain x water repellant is the best for repelling rain . it does a great job . when you drive on the highway in stormy weather there is no need for windshield wipers . the best repellant by farthis stuff is amazing works perfectly gas stays very functional all winter in the boat lawn mower and i use it in the snow blower over the summer . fantasticokeep my bike outside for a couple of days in a row during the summer this has protected my f i from all weather including a hurricane could not drive through it fits great and does not blow off
if you are familiar with the pedaltrain products you know how solid this product is . if you are new to effects it comes with plenty of velcro to mount pedals and brackets to mount a power brick they have a deal with voodoo so those bricks are will always fit . keep in mind you will have to drill holes for the brackets they are not predrilled .the duffel bag that it comes with has lots of padding and pockets and is pretty durable . if you have a power strip it won t fit around the edges of the bag the fit inside the bag is snug . that said i have a couple extra pedals not on my board that will fit in the pouch on the side along with strings and cables .this cover does not fit a full size acoustic electric hohner guitar . i measured the whole at but this cover does not even come close to fitting ! it measures in diameter so check your guitar closely !having feet of xlr xlr m f cables that can be used any way i want e .g . ea foot for stereo foot for mono or ea foot for multichannel work is very flexible .the packaging on these was also well done with a ziploc type bag and a velcro reusable wrap on each cord white to store them when not in use .as all of my sound equip is xlr or speakon connectors this worked great for a recent outdoor dj job . i ended up using all of the cords for mics and amplified speakers plus another of their foot cables for interconnect . you can never have enough xlr cables or adapters !
this cage fits in a small area nicely will still allowing plenty of room for your favorite nugget ! we have a green cheek conure and she loves the open play area on the top . i just tied toys to the small perch and poof climbing to hearts content . the pull out drawer is easily locked discretely and easy to clean . i particularly appreciate the stainless steel food cups it is just classier looking than the plastic ones many cages include . my only complaint is that in the picture posted on amazon there is a decorative metal around the top which this cage now does not have . it is a customer post so perhaps the company decided it was a cost saving measure to stop producing the cage with this decorative addition . i was hoping ours would have it but it did not . the coloring of the metal is unique also an almost antiqued look very attractive .i bought this cage because of the price at first because a lot of the other cage this size are way too expensive . i had some initial concerns with this cage . i thought that the top play perch looked cheap at first but it is actually really nice because unlike the other play top cages that have a whole separate play gym at the top this one is very easy to open close and it does not require a lot of cleaning like the full play gym tops do . plus when open it allows my bird to go in and out of the cage very easily and play with every thing in her cage . with the cages that have the full play gym tops the bird is either in or out of the cage . the stand to this cage and the shelf on the bottom are amazing ! it is very sturdy and is easily rolled around . the bottom tray slides out easily and the extra storage on the bottom is super awesome . the food bowls have little doors that can be opened from the outside and on the cage i got both were one one side of the cage rather than one on either side like in the picture .fit my gallon long wide high just right . the two glass pieces came already inserted into the plastic piece that allows the glass to be lifted for feeding . the other extra plastic piece goes onto the rear glass piece in case you have filters in the back and need to cut slots out for them . however i don t use that plastic piece and have a inch and a half space that fits well for my filter and heater . it also comes with an attachable handle that makes it easier to lift the glass .
good quality r .v . water heater drain valve . brass construction with a steel finger tip handle built in . a vital component when winterizing or just performing general maintenance . teflon tape will seal threads upon install . great replacement for older leaking or rusty valves .it is a shutoff does what it is supposed to . camco rv water tank filler with shutoff valve . would buy againused this to diagnose my evap system in my grand cherokee . had a few cracked hoses and a faulty leak detection pump . this allowed me to rule out the duty cycle purge valve the vent valve the vapor canister and also helped me diagnose the leak detection pump failing . it has already paid for itself .
i got of these to plug xlr cables into the jacks on my board . i got it because my board only has channels with xlr inputs . none of them work . perhaps i got the wrong thing ?the audio jack on my laptop was failing . i had to wiggle and twist the headphone plug until i could hear both channels . by that time half the youtube video was over . what a hassle ! i m trying to imagine how can i crack the case get in there with my soldering gun to replace the audio jack when i ran across this great idea . a plug and play usb device with both input and output audio jacks . took about one minute to install on my dell inspiron which recognized it immediately . problem solved quickly and elegantly .shipping was free and prompt from the amazon partner . good job platinum micro inc .i understand the input jack is mono so don t try to use this as a quasi recording studio . and consider the availability and accessibility of your usb ports . then order this great little solution to a big problem .this cable is an amazing find . it simply works ! i am not sure if some of the cables others have reviewed have had loose wiring in them but the cable i received is perfect .i plugged the cable into my windows laptop waited seconds while it recognized the cable and installed drivers and i was good to go . i plugged in a dynamic microphone opened the audacity software program hit record and it was amazing sound quality . i had previously used a variety of input devices from a jamhub to a behringer usb line input device to an art audio preamp to even going low budget with just a cable directly into the microphone input of the thinkpad laptop . this cable provides as high quality of an audio signal as any other reasonably priced device i have used .there are however a few limitations . . . this cable is mono only i .e . not for stereo recording . this seems obvious but is worth mentioning for those who have less experience with this type of stuff . this cable only works with dynamic microphones . if your microphone is a condenser microphone you either need a battery powered microphone or some type of phantom power source to power the condenser microphone .the really good things ? this cable works excellent at providing a good signal level to the audacity software . some input devices are either very hot too much level or have hardly any gain at all so this cable works very well by providing just the right level . this cable works amazingly well with a direct box to record a bass guitar acoustic electric guitar keyboard etc . i have a lot of direct boxes and this works well on all of them . i was able to record a bass guitar track with about the least amount of fuss ever think three minutes setup time from thinking of the idea to hitting record using just this cable and a hosa www .amazon .com gp product b ws q e direct box i purchased from amazon as well .
this is now the second whitmor cart i ve purchased . i got it for insulation really putting the cart in a picture window allows light in yet the stuff on its shelves blocks air flow when it s too hot or cold . easy to move out of the way .if you like lipped shelves then you will like this cart . you cannot install the shelving properly lip down each shelf is potentially unstable if bumped . that will matter if what s on the shelf is heavy or important . as in a computer . for this product would otherwise be ideal for holding computers . so i assembled the cart lip up . hint do the bottom shelf first and put the wheels on last . it s easy to assemble if done that way .edit the first cart review below is now deployed such that an old win dell dimension tower sits on the lowest shelf and an hp laserjet sits on the top shelf . in between is a shelf for paper and peripherals . the monitor sits right of the cart in white shelving . that gives you a sense of computer station usage . import it s easy to move the unit out to plug and unplug remove paper jams etc .original review of the first cart follows below . second is substantially the same . on the cart i had placed my optiplex sff with monitor on the top shelf my huge dell tower sits on the lowest shelf in between clearance are peripherals and wireless keyboards useful with either computer . it is stable and moves well on the house carpeting . thus i can wheel it forward for clearer viewing getting behind to mess with cables etc .i don t want to lift the tower out from the lower shelf but merely slide it . the lipping problem is solved by putting a large but relatively thin coffee table sized book beneath each computer enabling each machine to slide above the lip . it works but is not ideal . i lined middle shelf with rubbery kitchen drawer liner to keep air flow but mask the cords below .so only due to the lip up shelving is this five star product rated four stars . if you prefer a lip down design get the similar quality seville cart here in amazon for about the same price . i bought the sevilles too and reviewed them .note a computer chassis on a chrome chart will emit a vibration when on . depends on the type of chassis . the old fashioned tower emits almost no vibration . but a small form factor like the dell emits a substantial hum you can feel when you touch the cart . due to that the above mentioned book is more important it nearly eliminates the vibration .this unit folds up so small and flat that i love it for taking to presentations . the only caution i have is that it can get wobbly if you extend the legs to full length and the weight is not centered on the table . the legs store on the underside of the table and allows for a very compact table for a projector .i needed a stand for my laptop but couldn t justify paying for a shaped piece of metal or plastic . . . so when i saw this one at this price i jumped and definitely love it .it is really sturdy and holds my laptops samsung series and macbook air splendidly . the rubber base and rubber bottom edge that holds the laptop keeps the laptop secure and in place even when opening closing the lid . also it allows easy access to the sd card slot on my samsung which is found on the front left .the only problem not related to the stand is that my laptops don t open all the way so i m limited to the angle i can rest the laptop . no fear though as the stand is adjustable and lets me place it at the angle i need . also i tried using my samsung slate at the highest angle and it holds that perfectly as well .
 . . . . . .all i can say is the smell is horrible . . . . . star . . . . . please don t buy this one !this is so perfect in so many ways he can watch tv he can play i can breastfeed him or just take a nappy with me . love it ! this is easy to use but it does not disguise the smell that great ! i did like that you can use any kind of bag with it .

sometime round my friend kendal built several of these for our band . they were great and incredibly handy . i havent investigated this but i wondered later when i started seeing them marketed if he had developed the first one or not . certainly if he did he never patented it or anything .anyway flash forward years and here i was sitting with my row of stompboxes resenting batteries and individual power supplies . i thought back fondly to my first sound combo power supply and realized i needed to invest in one again . . . .and so i did . this one comes with some slip covers for any unused adapters . so far it has lived up to my expectations . i cat speak to playing out with this yet as i am mostly messing around in my little home studio but i definitely havent heard any crackle on my recordings or when just amping up and letting loose . so for such a simple device you really cant beat it . . .unless you dont really use boxes . personally i presently have my wah distortion chorus overdrive delay slap echo and flanger running through it . everything works great .enjoy !i bought this for my martin d for recording on my pc . so far it is working great . i have a behringer mixer already and i just plugged the guitar into that . it works perfectly . this guitar is very loud without a pickup but to get the sound into my pc for recording i either needed to use a mike or a pickup . i chose the pickup . i got too much background noise with the mike .update i started to get a loud buzz in my sound system and scratched my head a bit trying to figure it out . i had played my guitar about an hour before without that buzz being a problem . i discovered that if i turn the guitar a certain way the buzz went away . then i remembered that the only thing i was doing differently was that i had turned on another overhead light since it was dark outside . i turned that light off and the buzz went away . my pickup was picking up interference from the new type florescent bulbs in the light . i m glad there is nothing really wrong with the pickup . after using the pickup for awhile i have noticed that the th and th strings aren t as loud as i would expect also the nd string is louder than all of the strings . i m not sure why . it s not a big deal .i purchased this pa after reading several reviews and was convinced that is was right for me . i like that it is small and can fit right into my backpack . i was using the ion system it just got to be to much to carry around . i go around to different venues and sing . i just started in april after taking vocals for a year . i love it so much i ve purchased this and my own shure mic . b d is a powerful speaker system . i love the crisp sound and now i can hear myself sing when i turn up the music . i needed something with eq on it as well . you really can t go wrong with this pa monitor . i would have rated a except when i turn it up around degrees it begins to hiss . i m not sure if this is normal or not . you see i purchased an open box speaker . the outer box packaging was questionable but once opened the pa itself was in prime condition no visible damage and all the materials were packed well . the sound is great . i m testing it out at home for now still have some time if i m not comfortable with the hissing . hope this helps with your decision .
if like most people you use pencils only occasionally get an old standby boston hand crank sharpener . frequent pencil users though should consider a good electric sharpener . this x acto by boston is a heavy duty device that should provide many years of service . it only handles the standard pencil size which is far and away the most common . the catch tray for shavings incorporates the guide hole for the pencil and snaps rather tightly onto the main unit . the tray doesn t hold all that much . the x acto is fairly comparable to my old favorite the panasonic auto stop a sharpener that i ve used for decades . there s no real auto stop function on the x acto but the motor slows right down when the pencil is sharpened . also while my panasonic has four suction cups on its base for attachment to a desktop the x acto merely has rubber feet . however it s heavy enough to make suction cups unnecessary . it should be mentioned that the x acto s manual warns against sharpening waxy leaded pencils so colored pencil artists might choose another sharpener . this unit is somewhat expensive but does one job and does it well . pencils sharpened in this device will have a good point but not a needle like point that will break off with little pressure . the x acto s sturdy and heavy duty construction makes it an electric sharpener to definitely consider purchasing if you need one .this sharpener is powerful and smooth creating a very sharp well centered point . it also leaves a smoother wood finish than my other pencil sharpeners . it can sharpen a brand new pencil in less than seconds ! in the few cases that the pencil tip is off center with too much wood on one side i just stuck the pencil back in twisted it a little and it came out fine .it plugs in as opposed to batteries and mine had a cord with a prong plug . it takes standard diameter pencils only and isn t recommended for crayons chalk or soft waxy pencils as they will clog your sharpener s cutters . however you can get at the blades through the waste receptacle opening if you need to clean them .the waste receptacle is plastic with a bar sticking out the back that triggers a switch inside the sharpener so it will only turn on with the receptacle in place . the receptacle is a complete bowl unlike my other electric sharpener so the shavings won t spill when you pull it out . these shavings are by far the finest of my several sharpeners a fine dust that can electrostatically cling to the plastic receptacle and innards of the sharpener !the warranty is years on the cutter parts days one everything else such as the plastic waste receptacle .this will replace my battery operatedstaples battery operated pencil sharpenerwhich took aa batteries and had barely enough power to sharpen and stalled frequently .i also have a manualx acto model ks table or wall mount pencil sharpener which can handle various pencil diameters and which i recommend if you don t want a powered model .the x acto school pro electric pencil sharpener is fantastic . it does not over sharpen pencils and is easy to use . it can fit different sizes of pencils and has a marking for the standard size ! my kindergartener and my year old both use it with ease . it is easy to empty and the container that holds the shards is firmly attached does not come out easily while sharpening . the suction cups stick firmly to table top so you don t have to press down on top to hold steady .
this is one of those products that you hope you never have to use or take advantage of . but it s a great idea that more manufacturers should get involved with .azoo also offers a similar battery backup unit for about plus they have a self contained ac battery combo pump for continuous use which recharges its volt battery priced at about .one reviewer complained that the power cord didn t work and that his unit only functioned with battery power . news flash ! ! that s the way it s supposed to work ! ! this is a battery backup unit ! !the way it works is simple ac power holds a relay open . when ac power fails the relay closes and completes the battery circuit to power the pump . the power cord serves only to keep the relay open not to power the pump .unlike as in other reviews here the unit i have isn t all that noisy maybe it s a new model . the one thing i don t like about it is a stupidly short power cord only inches ! ! not good for mounting more than inches or so away from the aquarium or high on a wall to prevent backflow . make sure you install a check valve in the air line . also you should know the included air line is way too short .recommended for emergency use . stars . .this collar does what it is suppose to do . i apparently didn t read about the battery replacement but you can t just go buy one like i can the other bark collar i have . it ueses a battery that is built in to the lid of the battery connection . i don t want to have to wait for a new battery to arrive by mail when i need one . with my other bark collar i can find those batteries just about any place i go .this is perfect for a backup system for your aquarium . plug it into an outlet put batteries in and then it will turn on automatically when the power is out to that outlet . i plugged mine into the same power strip my filter runs off of so if the filter stops the bubbles will start and save the fish .runs a bit loud but that s to be expected from an emergency backup system . i actually like that it makes noise so you can be alerted that it s running right away so you know something wrong with the power to the tank .takes d batteries but can run on a single battery . i didn t notice a change in output with one vs . two batteries so i m guessing one battery just runs out quicker than with two .as an included bonus you can use this air pump to aid in transporting fish long distances .
the ink cartridge is o .k . but the epson r printer is a huge ink hog . the epson printer s that use this cartridge should all be recalled .bought the official refill ink cartridges for our epson printer . they work as they are supposed to .this cartridge last longer than the standard cartridge . it works well with my canon mp all in one printer .
this is a cheap piece of junk that does what it says it distorts you want something to make your guitar sound like junk this will do it . why pedals that make your guitar sound like a piece of junk are the most popular is beyond me . this is not a boutique distortion pedal like hendrix would use . boutique and distortion are an oxymoron .these things are built with heavy metal it should last i kinda hope it doesn t just kidding you want distortion you got distortionif you want to do swells with your instrument or make notes cry this will do the trick . smooth reliable action and no noise too .just bought this to see if it would inspire any new sounds for me . wow i love it . the capo works great with no buzzing and holds the strings down well . i am using it with a seagull entourage mini jumbo . it sounds divine . it makes chords nice and open and it is a blast to play with on the folk sound of the seagull a nice mellow relaxed open sound . inspires my ears to make music . buy it .
after a power outage i connected my refrigerator to this power supply . sadly its inverter was unable to support my refrigerator . the duracell dpp hd doesn t have enough momentary output to handle the initial start up current spike of a refrigerator s compressor motor . the specifications say it can momentarily provide up to watts . this equates to amps at v . yet public benchmark figures for a home refrigerator s start up current indicate amps for up to second . other appliances that use electric motors such as sump pumps are likely to exhibit the same characteristics . my suggestion is that customers immediately test this product with any device they intend to power during an outage .some important specifications are missing in the amazon listing . one of the key statics is the capacity of the internal battery which is amp hours at v . this equates to watt hours . yet ac output is much lower than this presumably due to inverter losses . these losses increase with power output . the following table illustrates this . the last column is my calculation .load . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .watts . . . .hours . . . .watt hourscordless telephone . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . portable stereo . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . laptop computer . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . fan . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . tv . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . drill . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . warm air fan heater . . . . . . . . . . . . . . blender . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . hid floodlights . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . observe that the total energy delivered watt hour drops with power consumption . ultimately the usable energy is significantly less than what is contained within the lead acid battery .for reference a refrigerator will use about watts of electricity when the compressor is running . typical consumers will have their refrigerator running about to of the time which equates to an average of watts being consumed continuously .consdoesn t handle current spikes associated with certain electric motorsprosboth ac and dc outputportablesimple operationvery strong battery tender for the price . . . . . . .has a powerful charge for my battery in a . l ford high compression motor .excellent all the way around .i ordered different chargers to maintain my gate opener s deep cycle battery a simple output charger with extension cords for charging other deep cycle batteries from amazonbattery tender dl wh v bank battery management system and this unit has a far superior charging design .the bank battery tender does a simple fast rate charge then switches to a trickle charge at a constant voltage with outputs .this unit pulses the battery under charge and features operating modes with different current outputs for different sized batteries . the selections are motorcycle which also works well for sla gel cells or agm batteries standard automotive starting battery deep cycle batttery and off .what makes the ctek unit special is that it uses a pulse charge in all modes to attempt to desulphate batteries while the battery tender does not . this method of charging has proven successful in restoring lead acid batteries that won t take a charge any more .it comes with a waterproof v output cable and a set of clips or rings for permanent installation under the hood of your car . in addition to the leds for indicating the type of battery being charged a second set is provided for empty full and maintenance pulse charge mode .there is also a noticable increase in quality between the battery tender and this unit small details like a water sealed housing and gaskets on the connectors indicate quality in manufacture .for a single v lead chemistry battery this is a useful well made tool .
i have used this on both fluval and a lines . it is easy to use and you will be amazed at the gunk you flush out . i run the brush through then run some water through the filter in my sink .once i detached the hoses but that was such a pain i didn t do that again .i d highly recommend this if you have fluval filters . and i m sure it will work on other canister filter tubing as well .i can t really tell if water flow is better after cleaning out the tubing but i m sure it is improved as well and that can only be good for both the tank and the canister filter .after i got tired of of playing with my marineland penguin which never worked quite correctly i think it was defective i decided to try the aquaclear which i had seen recommended often in various online forums and reviews . it has been cited as a hob filter that performs more like a canister filter .this filter does indeed mimic a canister filter . it contains a large sponge carbon bag which is somewhat costly to replace but as you know can be easily modified and media bag filled with noodles to increase biological filtration . when this filter performs it performs well .so why the two stars ? there are two qualities about this filter that make it ultimately undesirable . it is difficult to use . it is unreliable .let me first talk about its difficulty . putting this together and inserting the media are quite easy getting it started is another thing . it comes with a leveling device to help make sure this is level on the tank . this device repeatedly pops out of its slot to the point that i have to search for it on the floor behind my tank stand every time i service the tank . priming it is another problem . this is one of the trickiest hob filters to prime . one of the main reasons i disposed of my penguin is that it was a great challenge to prime . as i mentioned i think the penguin was defective . the aquaclear is even more challenging to prime and i think it is meant to work this way . i have another aquaclear on a separate tank that behaves the same way . sometimes i have to disassemble the entire filter before i can prime it . you must be doing something wrong someone is thinking right now . no . i m sorry . if i have to use a level on a hob filter before i can properly use it then the filter is at fault not me .the other major problem with this filter is that it is unreliable . it is not self priming . i often have to leave town for several days and i like having the peace of mind that after a power outage my filtration will continue to operate . what good is an effective system of filtration if it fails to work ?but you say the aquaclear provides the best biological filtration available in a hob filter . if you want effective biological filtration in a hob filter that is also self priming and reliable you won t find one on the market . however if you buy atetra whisper power filter gallonand fill it withmarineland pa canister filter bio balls pc bioballs you will have biological filtration that is just as effective as that provided by the aquaclear in a filter that is self priming and easy to use .if that doesn t appeal to you buy aaqueon quietflow power filter gphand shove a piece of bio sponge in the back behind the cartridges . the aqueon filters are totally self priming and never fail to work after a power outage because of their clever design .with just a simple mod you can have a filter that is even better than the aquaclear without the hassle .this thing is bullet proof ! nice design and really powerful ! great value for just over . i never used the bio wheels because i only use this pump as a water polisher for tank maintenance . i actually wrap the polishing filter with a hepa filter . micron and it powers through the cycling of the water . i m sure other canister filters couldn t do that ! to move the water through that filter takes power that this pump has ! i couldn t be happier with the purchase ! highly recommend this canister filter !
this is a serious keyboard platform . it will probably last forever certainly longer than your keyboard . it is the sort of durable no nonsense piece of equipment you might find in a large office setting .five things come in the box a long . gel filled wrist rest covered in black leather textured vinyl a matte grey composition board platform for the keyboard that looks like a cutting board two double sided adhesive attachers for the wrist rest to be permanently attached to the platform a plastic bag of two sizes of black rubber feet that once attached to the bottom of the platform will tilt the platform up or down an owner s manualthe idea is that if your keyboard does not come with tilting feet you can tilt the platform with either or both of the two sizes of feet and then place your keyboard on top of the platform . the adhesive on the feet is permanent so if you want to re adjust later on you will not be able . once the gel wrist support is adhered to the platform there will only be room enough for a standard straight across keyboard . the gel wrist support does not really need to be pasted down to the platform it can sit in front of it and will not slip or slide around .the best thing about this product is the gel wrist rest . it is firm but supportive and comfortable . it is supposed to have antimicrobial product protection . the manufacturer m claims that it will inhibit the growth of microorganisms such as bacteria on the product surface that can cause stains odors and product degradation . i have no idea if this is something that is chemically embedded into the vinyl and or gel or if this vinyl is just naturally microbe stain odor degradation adverse .my last gel wrist rest became lumpy and saggy after a few years . this one seems to be far more durable .one of the main things i like about this tape compared to others i have used is that it is not overly sticky so you don t have to muscle it off the roll . it is flexible but just sturdy enough to not fold over on itself . this is polypropylene film reinforced with glass yarns with specially formulated rubber resin adhesive . as advertised it does stick well to a variety of surfaces such as plastic metal fiberboard . i prefer using a hand held tape dispenser with this .while the mounting of objects on walls is a great use for double sided tape its unintended uses are also very practical .being able to test fit components with this type of tape before final glued assembly is particularly handy . just be aware that the tape can pull off the top surface of any layered material .you can attach a fairly heavy object anywhere you want on a smooth strong surface . an open end wrench from a model t is currently attached to my toolbox fascia strictly for aesthetic purposes .most often i use it for securing small rubber feet pads at the bottom of items that live on tabletops as well as securing shims of wood cork plastic cardboard metal rubber etc . onto the bottom of uneven items .if you need to re attach or re orient an object that had a single use peel off sticky surface originally applied this tape is your friend . the most common usage in that category is the deer whistles re attachment on my car s front bumper . i always seem to find them on the ground where i park . take the time to remove any residual gunk with a goo gone dissolve it like solvent and then some alcohol to get rid of any oily film first .just appreciate that this tape is permanent in the sense that disassembling the pieces it connects may damage them . you need to pry things off very slowly and carefully . it is also almost structural at the scale of flimsy plastic components which seems to describe most objects these days .there is another variant heavy duty double sided tape colored red rather than white for more massive items and those that you d prefer to not ever come loose . it works almost like an epoxy . i used some most recently for attaching a rubber foam door seal intended for a garage door s bottom edge as a threshold on a tile floor year on and it s still holding .also don t throw the packaging away since it lists the strength of the adhesive which is very convenient when you want to calculate how much to use . wide tape is also available .this product is an indispensable item in my toolbox fabrication drawer . i don t use much but even a small piece is oftentimes invaluable .
i m a bit of a pen fanatic and love to have a wide assortment of colors and types for different purposes . i got all the different sets i could find of the sakura brand and was very happy with them . this set includes lime deep purple coral orange yellow aqua magenta red marina blue and pink . all colors are fluorescent tones . note that these are my descriptions of the colors not theirs . these pen cases are clear and have a shiny colored cap that indicates the ink color which is imprinted with a crescent moon and one star . the ink is matte and vivid and goes on very smoothly .this set contains assorted colors . of them are pastel colors like pink flamingo ocenview blue and lime sorbet . of them are bold and bright colors like fandango pink hot aqua and tranquil teal . of them are darker bold colors like rambunctious red tuxedo black and forest green . all of the colors are unique but the meadow green and for ever green seem to be almost identical . other than that i would say this is a good variety of colors for school projects labeling or various other tasks . they come in a plastic case for storage . each marker has its own slot . each marker has a rubber grip and comfortable to hold . i really like this set a lot . the price is also a lot better than buying the markers separately or in smaller packaging .these highlighters come in a fun variety of colors of red hot pink bright orange fluorescenct yellow green turquoise royal blue and lilac purple within the resuable clear pack . the practical click to use click to close retractible design assures that the tips never are exposed to drying out compared to the other brands where you must keep the cap on tightly . my kids love the brand new colors for crafts coloring and papers . i enjoy them for color coding school work and studying materials .they are about inches long and a little thicker than other highlighters but not as bulky as the dry erase markers . the ink is vibrant and comparative with other sharpie models complete with the angled tips .
if you are going to wax your vehicle which you should about twice a year in a cool spot in the shade you should evaluate the clear and if it has a lot of swirl marks you should consider polishing the car and then waxing it . i like to do the mothers three step process polish micro polish and wax but i still had some of this so i used this as step one .i used this product in conjunction with an appropriate primer and clearcoat all from vht to paint my car s brake calipers bright glossy red .step remove brake dust grease and rust using a brake caliper cleaning agent of some kind . also use a wire brush if you can .step sand your calipers using grit sandpaper . really rough them up . then use some more brake cleaner .step mask off your car s corner body panels the wheel wells the struts and hoses and finally the brake rotors . take the time to mask the bleed valves on the calipers too .step apply primer to the caliper in a very light speckled coat then move to the next caliper until you ve applied a coat to all . do this times gradually getting heavier but avoid letting the paint run it s okay if it happens in the primer . try to do this as quickly as possible .step apply your base color this product using the same method as in step light coats multiple times . i suggest a sweeping method rather than just spraying hard . do not allow the base color to run .step apply a clear coat using the same method as in steps and but be careful not to overdo it . clear coats can run more easily than base colors . the paint should be looking thick and glossy by this time .step wait an hour . drink a beer or something .step remove your masking . gaze upon your new calipers . then use some brake cleaner to remove any overspray from the brake rotors or undercarriage areas . do not use brake cleaner to clean body panels as it will probably remove the paint .step put your wheels back on . wait a few more hours . then drive your car pretty hard making sure to go fast and brake hard . this will heat your brakes up . the paint needs to cure at f which means you need to drive and brake repeatedly . don t go too nuts .that s it ! all finished .wish it were cheaper but i won t use a product that might damage the paint on my classic so i pay the price . only reason for not giving it another star is how much it costs . using a stretched out x inch piece of clay along with the meguiar s detailing spray for lubrication makes pretty easy work for a step that i m not that fond of doing . i m always shocked at how much garbage the clay picks up from what looked like a clean paint surface . the smoothness after going over the paint shows that this stuff is working great . cleaning the car with soap and water is the first step and using the clay is definitely the necessary second step before moving on to polishing and waxing .
i ordered this and theethical inch pet food can covers packand i like the pack better . yes this is a bit hard to remove and i m a very strong woman and it is sturdy . . . .but the other ones work just a well and i also mentioned in the review for that product that i found a similar pack at my local dollar store that work great too ! !i had purchased the petmate deluxe model of the ounce pet fountain for my cats . that works exactly as described and my cats drink more than they did from bowls of water around the house . i like blue and the basic model seemed as if it would perform the same as the deluxe model . my cats still drink from this model but it doesn t fit together as well as the deluxe model and as a result it often leaks leaving puddles around it . if i purchase another i will only get the deluxe model .my fish love this food they won t eat other brand pellets i ve tried plus this is a good price for this bag i get the medium sized so my other cichlids can eat it also . i do mix up food with sinking ones and also different hikari brands and some other things but this is my go to food .
to put it simply this is a necessary item for every home with a baby . . no refill bags tip can store extra empty bags inside in the bottom easy to empty clean no odors not big bulkyportable and easy to use . love the convience and ease of use . only need water and the microwave to kill the germs . very convient and can do bottles at a time or even baby spoons forks even bowls or cups your choice . if it fits inside with lid snapped shut then you can steralize it like me . remember do not force it to close as that will run seal .i don t know how people can say that this rack doesn t hold all bottle sizes . it sure does . you can put the wide neck or smaller dr browns on this . it will hold the smaller neck bottles up a little higher and the wider bottles down flat onto the bottom . but all bottles work . and better yet it has the extra tray like places to to store everything else . it is nice b c you can put all the extra parts in the tray and even put them on top of each other and they dry perfect . then the place where you can lay the nipples sideways is great . i use the dr browns bottles and the i put the tubes sticking through the spaces by the nipples . then there is the small tray that i put my yellow pieces of the medela pump . it is soooooooooo versitile ! ! ! who would want a rack with just the poles . then you can only dry bottles and no other parts . duh ! !
this is a great little keyboard for use with garageband on the ipad . garageband recognizes it as a controller for the keyboard smart keyboard sampler smart guitar smart bass and drums . you can even solo on the akai keyboard while the smart keyboard autoplays an accompaniment ! in addition to offering the superior feel of a real keyboard this akai keyboard has much more consistent touch sensitivity than what s built into garageband for ipad .unlike other keyboard controllers i ve tried this one plugs and plays with the ipad no powered usb hub required . you do need apple s camera connection kit of course to add a usb port to your ipad . it s not loaded with gimmicks just the essentials and the essentials work very well indeed . the keys are of standard width which is large enough for fumble free playing . it s lightweight compact and thus perfectly suited as an ipad accessory .i m using it for my alesis q midi keyboard . folds up easy so i can tuck it away . it may not work with a keyboard smaller than keys . as you lower it the support spreads out wide . good quality . adjustable height and for the dept of the keyboard .sturdy mic clip on a budget . mic fits snugly into the clip allowing the rage to commence . will purchase more as needed .
this device is the best you can buy . there is nothing negative to write about it if you put the slightly high price aside . zero noise . indestructible casing . if you are reading this review you are considering investing in the best you can buy for your rig . do it !for the price these can t be beat . at this price it doesn t hurt to have a spare one or two on hand for the inevitable emergencythis is an overpriced item . that is my only complaint . there s enough reviews on here that state the obvious . it is small it sounds good and can keep up with a little jazz trio by itself which is amazing . however i have to say i m super uber pissed that the day after i bought this amp at sam ash for it dropped to about . how does an amp just come down half price over night ? i mean what kind of scam was this company running if they can afford to stay in business and sell them half the price than they were originally marked at ? it s like the blue blocker sunglasses . on tv they re sold for . months later you can get them in the barging bin for at cvs . this is not ethical business this is trying to get as much as you can from your customers with no regard to true value . . ps the ambiance was a better feature than newer verb processors .edit just read another guy who gives it stars because it can be used as a weapon to knock someone out . not sure if this amp deserves the stars it is getting and certainly not because it can bludgeon someone to death in an alley . i stand by my logically opinions of this item . zt should not have sold this for in the first place . it inadvertently turned customers like me off to the company name .
the danelectro mini amp was an impulse buy for me but this thing is fantastic ! clean tones to woodstock fuzz this thing belts em out . only complaint battery doesn t last too long . get a power adapter . otherwise great practice amp !the pedal works as described . the draw back is the battery installation . you have to take the pedal off to access the battery . the other thing is if you forget to unplug the input cord from your guitar the battery drains when not in use . i purchased a power supply to go along with it . the problem with that is the power supply is one more thing to find a plug in for . it s ok for the money and works good . i run it wide open and have the amp gain pretty high also to get the retro sound i am looking for . i mainly use it with a large body f hole guitar with a set of very heavy flat wound strings . the lows with vibrate the fillings out of your teeth !this behringer box is a very good tool effect i would recommend to anyone from beginner to pro . one thing should be noted the light is amber not blue and no volt battery is required . the device comes with a removable power cord which to me is a big plus .
i use this exclusively to de chlorinate my water . my fish look happy and are never shocked when i do a water change . the only gripe is the sulfur smell of the product . while the label claims it will smell like that in concentrate you just can t get used to it when measuring it out . it doesn t smell once it s diluted in water so hold your nose initially ! having used this before i can say it works pretty good . i think the smell is wonderful on it and i don t have to go nuts blotting or scrubbing . just spray it on leave it a bit and lightly blot it .these are a lifesaver along with our automatic kittylitter box cleaner . the only thing i don t like are the filters that you buy to go with them . i can never keep them attached . maybe if they made that part of it less smooth so that the glue from the scent filter would actually stick these would be perfect
what can you say these are mailing labels for large envelopes or packages . they are plain white come in sheets of ten with the usual supporting formats in office suites and online at the avery website . the one key aspect of these labels that makes them different from the standard labels is the trueblock that masks any text that they are laid over no more seeing through the label to the prior addressee .as far as i am concerned these labels fulfill all of the claims made by avery and work splendidly . p these labels are excellent clear .pros sticky but easily removable labels are lightweight and thin labels look sleek high qualitycons labels are a bit delicate price is highif you are in need of clear labels these are a great option !i have been using avery address labels for years . they are perfect for addressing envelopes labeling files and even captioning photos in albums . avery labels are easy to use rarely smudge and peel off easily . the package contains sheets labels per sheet for a total of labels . avery address labels are handy for home school or office use and work well with most printers . highly recommended .
on paper this copy holder is a great idea and with the m brand you know it is a quality product . this copy holder helps you keep a book in a slanted upright position so that you can refer to it easily . thanks to the extra heavy base it can really be any book including a dictionary . the elastic band keeps the book open and can serve as a line guide . so what s not to like ?it turns out that in everyday use i start to grow tired of it . first it is the size . inch is really big which is great if you need to hold a book open or have two sheets of letter sized paper side by side . but when the holder is empty it s really quite noticeable if left in front of the monitor . fine i will remove it when empty . but the base is heavy and the holder is not easily collapsible . both of these are in fact pros in my mind . there are a cons . the elastic band that holds the book open is not easily adjustable if you only want to use one hand . it also seems that this elastic band is the weakest component and will surely break the earliest . but it s hard to tell how long it will hold .overall i would say that this is great if you need an industrial grade copy holder on a regular basis with regular being the keyword here .i m not quite sure how to review these dividers . they re what you d expect . they . . . divide . they seem durable the punched holes are reinforced the tabs are a good size to be clearly visible and they come with extra tab inserts in case you can t make up your mind between expenses and outgoing . they will do the job little troopers that they are . it s true they re not flashy or showy but sometimes the homey virtues are the best .these are nice colorful mini binder clips that are a must for any office environment . they do what they are supposed to do hold papers together .
works with any strap . for a quick detach system of so you don t have to drill for a strap button to hold your guitar .bought this strap for my acoustic guitar however the neck button was to close to the neck for the wide locking device at the end of the strap . nicely made and works well to retain strap to guitar .the dunlop strap locks work pretty well but the standard hole cut in a standard leather strap is not big enough to accomidate the locking buttons . the strap has to be modified by increasing the size of the holes . this for all intents and purposes means that you will not be able to use that strap with standard strap buttons ever again .they do work as advertised and they are easy to take on and off for strap adjustment when required .
this tascam us usb audio interface is exactly what i was looking for to record from our wireless mic with xlr outputs directly to my pc video editing software . we professionally produce instructional videos and needed this for voice over work on existing footage . before getting this convenient little unit we had to record into a camcorder and then import it into the pc so this saves us a step when we only need to record audio . here are my observations plug and play connected to my pc via usb and was instantly recognized usb powered no external power needed a big plus when using my laptop good sound clean and clear input multiple inputs xlr mic rca stereo line and hi z guitarmisc xlr input is not powered not a problem for us includes audacity software but we did not need to load ithighly recommended !cfhnotice in the name guitar input . this is not to be confused with the amplitube irig which achieves input and output through the ipad ios devices headphone jack . headphone connections can be noisy and have reliable connection problems . they also depend on the built in ad da converters in the ipad ios device . this apogee jam k is a professional quality input device that has dedicated a d analogue to digital converter but depends on the built in hardware of the ipad ios device for playback . on the other hand apogee one has both ad and da convertors for both input and output .amplitube irig from ik multimedia has a simple stereo headphone in and out jack plug that plugs into your ipad . the built in hardware in the ipad is something that i love for doing something like watching a movie cozying up to the inch screen but for audio phile quality you need a dedicated a dedicated pre and ad convertor and that is what this apogee jam k has . mind you it has that for audio recording input but playback is handled via your headphone jack on your ipad . you can of course just use that for monitoring your mix and then save the file in a digital format internally and send to a playback device with pristine digital audio quality e .g . saving as a .wav file . this makes the apogee k jam a very usable device to achieve high quality recordings at a very nice price .so here it the continuum . amplitube irig for headphone jack input and output quality built into your ipad etc . the apogee jam k for digital quality conversion on input only with playback being handled by headphone jack on ipad . the apogee one on the other hand at roughly times the price gives you both ad da conversions so it has its own audio output jack plus tracks of recording either instrument and or a balanced external microphone jack . it also comes with a built in condenser mic that is pretty amazing . it also has volt phantom power for using your favorite condenser mic . when you get into the apogee duet and quartet you get more connections plus the all too important option of midi connectivity .very simple device to connect a quality dynamic microphone or instrument using a direct box to the usb input of a computer . i plugged in my mic and plugged the cable into my pc . win automatically searched for and found the drivers in about three minutes . i then recorded some vocals using audacity a free open source download . recording was whisper quiet with no background hiss or noise at all . recording level was great not sure why some reviewers said it was too low . note that this will not provide phantom power nor does the item description imply that it will . usb only provides vdc and phantom power usually requires vdc . unless there is some kind of power converter which would be much too large to fit in this compact package it is impossible for this or any similar sized cable to provide the higher voltage that phantom power requires . use this with a dynamic mic or direct box and if you use it correctly you will be very happy !
i received free samples of this product when i purchased products made by zoomed .probability or in total and it works fine as a water conditioner .the only notation i have is that does add a blue color to the water that is treated which does look cool in lizard snake and turtle water bowels waterfalls and small contained body s of water .if you were to use this in a fish tank or aquatic turtles habitat it would turn the water blue so it is some thing to think about when deciding weather or not this is the correct product for your application .the foam for the aquaclear filters does a great job at removing waist form the water . this is a very dense sponge . i am sure that this product helps with the biological filtration . very easy to clean . all you have to do is squeeze it in a bucket of tank water . you never want to rince this in clorinated water . always use dechlorinated water . i am very satisfied with this .this stuff does its job and can be used to dechlorinate water and also as an emergency to detoxify nitrates etc .
i put up a solar light on my brick fence wall in the back yard using this tape . it really holds well and the light as not budged . saved me from having to drill holes in the wall . highly recommend .this stand was used to hold an acer v wbd widescreen tft lcd monitor . the built in monitor stand was easily removed before attaching the monitor to the neoflex . the holes on the back of the monitor matched up perfectly with the plate on the neoflex . completing the install was a cinch . the monitor can be lifted vertically using a spring loaded mechanism . it can be rotated degrees tilted and rotated about the base . couldn t ask for more flexibility . my wife s macbook will be connected to this setup as soon as we get the adapter cord . well made and solid unit should last for years ! buy it ! ! !it does what it advertises but i mounted between two x inside the wall so it s harder to just pry it from the wall used long deck screws . as it is good whack with a hammer at it s flying of the wall .
a bit tough to insert the key into the hole as the towing light outlet on the left is partly in the way . it s manageable to lock and unlock but you have to do it at a slight angle and or wiggle it in . the black makes it look hidden and matches nice .when i saw at the picture online i thought they were reflective like a mirror finish but they were just light gray with a darker fabric on some of the sides . they fit the window fairly well with only a small area in the bottom middle of the window where light gets in . it does help a little with keeping the car and steering wheel from getting too hot while sitting in the sun . its better than using nothing .this device attaches securely to the tow vehicle but at a cost .they are cumbersome to attach and detach with several moving parts and the potential to scratch the tow vehicle paint during either process if you don t have three hands available .to attain the secure vibration free fit you must crank down on the ratcheted web strap hard enough to deform the door where it attaches to the window channel . it also deforms the rubber window seal .foam pads protect the door somewhat where the bracket would otherwise rub on the body but if the area isn t meticulously clean beforehand i can see where it would dull the paint over time .because of the metal claw part that fits into the window channel raising and lowering the window caused a screeching sound on my driver s side window .finally when they are detached from the door they make for a very bulky awkward device that doesn t store conveniently or compactly in the vehicle .i m sending them back .
everyone develops personal preferences over time for one reason or another . i have a personal preference for the xlr ends with the really fine threaded plastic cap on the outside first to slide down the cable with a legged gripper underneath that slides next down the cable and pinches down as you tighten the plastic outer cap into the metal housing with the solder contacts causing the gripper to strain relief most cable diameters . unfortunately that design isn t used here but i chose to award the star rating for value because you get of good quality shielded cable with xlr ends m and f for well under ft .as for pinout it s straightforward pin is tied to the metal grip and shield and connects between both ends while pins and are run isolated between both ends . the end design chosen uses the single set screw connector the tiny one that gets lost so easy if you need to take it apart and the rubber bumper design on the back which i haven t had the best of luck making quick changes in the field with however for interconnecting equipment on a temporary basis these cables are an important starting point of any audio engineer s kit because they will be used not if but when the need arises .another favorite of mine is the pack of foot male to female cables which do use my favorite xlr ends mentioned above which amazon will rush you gls audio ft patch cable cords xlr male to xlr female black cables balanced snake cord pack these are very easy to open an end change phase lift ground or input someone s oddball source signal . having on hand means you won t quibble over cable costs before the show starts and that channel will be in the final mix .back to pyle s product here i basically took away star for not using the easy to open and re wire xlrs but gave them a star for value in the product since it s feet long and will reach between my mixer and most anything else inside the booth for under a buck a foot . it s also great when someone yells it s too short i need a cable stretcher at the podium ! and quickly adds feet of noise free movement to a stage snake that either wasn t planned for or got moved quit working . for the price they have saved many installations from being torn up or rewired which means no surprises opening the next showing .i finally equipped my cable kit with the usual xlr to rca trs hi z transformers and the above mentioned pack of foot cables to quickly gain access to the xlr terminals if need be plus of these foot cables mainly to solve distance problems and a roll of gaffer s tape for good measure to prevent tripping hazards . i used to have ea foot xlr cables but no sooner than the box was opened one became a permanent addition to the stage snake so now i have one left for my kit . with all that i had to build an emergency xlr to . mm ts all metal shielded connector for a mike input on short notice so a soldering kit with misc plugs got added to my cable bin . even though all this was under it has saved the day more than once and made the show go on so a bit of what if thinking and judicial purchases can make you look like the miracle mixer in the black painted room and justify your existance when the owner s daugher s toy musicbox becomes a channel in the house mix thanks to some quick cable magic .my last cable advice is never deconstruct something you custom made . it will no doubt be needed again and since you made it you ll know why how and where it was used before thus you save time not recreating a past fix rather pulling it from your magic box of tricks and solving the problem . people think you can hook anything up where others tried and failed furthering your staff position . my only exception goes to cables that violate every standard and didn t serve to fix the problem like that phase reversed ground lifted xlr pin stereo y splitter to dual trs female cable i made for the harmonica duet where the performers had nose rings and lip bars pierced and kept getting static with their mics when they held the harmonica up to their jewelry . i chalked that up to being part of the intended musical signal wondering just how much it hurt to play with all the piercings scraping along the harmonica when i setup my monitor speakers to listen to just that stereo channel in rehersal at the console .this unit is compact enough to take with you if you need a small interface to take along with your laptop for field recording . it is powered via the usb bus so you don t have to carry power supplies or worry about finding an outlet for the device .one issue is that this is not a plug and play device . you will need to install a device driver in order for your computer to recognize it . after the driver was installed i was able to get pro tools to recognize it right away without any issue . i recorded some tracks just to see how easy it was to work with and how it sounded . it works like any other interface in pro tools so you will be able to use it easily enough . the mic pre amps don t seem terribly powerful and you will have to really up the input level to get anything out of a v condenser microphone like the ones i use to record vocals and guitars . i found that the overall sound quality was okay but just okay . i wouldn t want to use this for anything important but it will work fine if you are doing a field recording of rehearsals or doing pre production in a practice space . i wouldn t recommend it for serious studio work though and i would rather drag my pro tools i o rack to a location if i was in the field .the build quality is a bit suspect on this as well . i noticed that the unit made a clinking noise when i picked it up after taking it out of the box . it seems that the bottom panel is not secure and is a bit loose . i can move the top and bottom together and apart making a clinking sound . this can of course be taken care of very easily but i would rather have a device come as it should . i have never had a problem with a tascam unit before and i have had a ton over the years so i hope this is just a one off quality control issue . the knobs feel okay but there is a bit of play in the line out control and one of the attenuators is sticky .bottom line starsrecommended for casual use but not for commercial usei d chose this cable cause i own an older one with the angle plug and needed another longer cable with the straight end . i like the idea that you can cut the power and remove the cable from the instrument with having mute the amp or mixer . i recommend this product to anyone who likes the ability to disconnect without doing anything else .
basically you buy a pack of sticker sheets . the sheets are uncut and . by . they fit into any printer and you can download templates or use your own . you can print any kind of sticker graphic picture text from word anything goes then you cut out your graphic in the shape you want and you have a custom sticker . the possibilities are endless .the sticker project paper would be especially fun with kids allowing them to pick a graphic then print them a sticker . they can print one sticker or a page of stickers . i love easy projects like this for kids . i would recommend this product and especially use it this time of year .my wife needed some cards for recipes and we ordered these since there was a discount on the box . the cards are good quality card stock and we can print three recipe cards per page .with a little work on the computer you can add just about anything you want on the cards and the bakers and cookers will thank you time and time again . by adding some color you can make those plain white cards into a very nice recipe card .this product consists of decent quality . x matte card stock with a partial laser perforation in the middle so the it folds in half evenly . envelopes are included in the package . this is larger than a typical greeting card but the size makes it easy to use with just about any printer . the paper accepts and absorbs the ink without seeping through or veining in the paper fibers . the paper color is not bright white but is appropriate for a greeting card .the package insert dated states that avery designpro software is windows only . however avery designpro for mac osx is now available as a free download on the avery .com software page . avery designpro for mac is a basic graphic design and layout program which includes templates for most avery products including avery american greetings half fold blank cards . this is the easiest way i know of to use this kind of product . in addition avery designpro includes a printer calibration feature . absolute precision is not so critical on greeting cards but if you re printing per page return address labels a fraction of an inch one way or the other can run a whole sheet of labels .my printer an hp has a duplex two sided printing attachment . the designpro software will print both sides on the same job . the trick is to choose short edge binding in the print dialog box . if you choose long edge the inside of the card will print upside down on the wrong page . the preview in the print dialog box does not show the inside page but it does print . if your printer does not have a duplex attachment then you simply print page only flip the paper over and then print page only . i d suggest trying this once or twice with plain paper so you know exactly how to flip the paper for your particular printer .to me these products fall in the etiquette scale between a hand written note on your personal letterhead and a greeting card you bought in the grocery store . they do show you put some time and effort into the communication .
pros battery driven flashing or steady light flameless flare can be used as a map light reusable . could be used effectively as a light that does not seriously degrade night vision .cons product claims to be visible at ft but this is only possible within a few degrees of view . one half of the top lights up for a dim presentation but the bright led shines out through a narrow beam like a small red flashlight . consequently the flare would probably not be useful in a traffic situation since it would have to be precisely aligned with oncoming traffic and would only be visible by the few drivers within this narrow beam of light . it is certainly not a good substitute for a real flare which is much brighter and omnidirectional . this little light is not as good as the emergency flashers built into vehicles .if you want a safety flare to carry in your vehicle buy the real thing . if you want a light you can use as a map light without distracting a driver or to see where you re walking without seriously degrading your night vision this red light will do that well .fits well in my my cars adapter . display section swivels degrees for convenient viewing .large easy to read numbers and backlit lcd display . led warning lights have modes one mode for battery motor off andone mode for alternator motoring running . very useful since you don t need to know the actual voltages for a healthy battery or charging system .accurate . i checked the voltage reading with a professional calibrated voltmeter and it was within . volts . surprised me it was that accurate note the lcd backlight and led is always on and are bright . this may distracting to some people driving at night .very happy with this unit . i would buy it again and recommend it to a friend .the wolo model ba heavy duty commercial grade back up alarm is perfect for the rear of any rv of size . it s small about wide x tall and deep and loud enough to alert anyone you are backing . the sound is exactly like what you hear on garbage trucks and many commercial vehicles .wiring the unit is simple and one of the mounting bolt screw holes automatically grounds the horn to the vehicle chassis . i used the backup light wiring in the truck to trailer cable that was not used by my trailer to get the volt positive voltage to the trailer . i then connected to the trailer wiring block using a gauge hot lead to take the voltage to the backup alarm mounted on the read of the trailer . whenever i have the trailer attached to the truck and then shift the truck into reverse bingo . the alarm begins beeping . of course anytime the truck backup lights are activated like using the key fob to shut off the truck burglar alarm the backup horn activates for about seconds .
very small cars only . suv or truck or large car tires do not fit well between the ridges and deform the product . i fastened the mat down with tapcon concrete screws each inches long into my garage slab . the leading edge of the mat tore off the screws and folded up . the adhesive strip behind the mat was also useless . i would have had better result with a x piece of fir or pine and concrete screwing it to the garage slab . you also have to aim the car perfectly when you park it because the mat is only as wide as the tire . i can t return it because it s damaged from use due to faulty design . wasted my money .caveat i have a front wheel drive car and i back into my garage . the parking mat goes under my rear un driven wheels . perhaps that makes my experience different from some of the others .i found about this product from a show on speed channel that was talking about garage products . the host said the big benefit of this mat was that your tire rolled onto the front part of the mat first holding it down before it rolled it over the hump . thus this mat didn t need to be fixed to your garage floor . that s what i wanted something that didn t need to be permanently attached to the floor . the guy on tv didn t even mention that it came with tape .i did put a little masking tape on the garage floor to mark where i typically position the mat so i can remove it to sweep or whatever and replace it right back where it goes as needed . i don t use the adhesive tape it comes with to adhere it to the floor . in my case it works perfectly just like the guys on speed channel described . i ve used it for a little over a month now and my mat simply doesn t move . ok maybe it moves some ridiculously trivial amount but for all intents and purposes it has stayed put for a month . if the mat is going under your driven wheels or steering wheels i can understand how it might move around .others have complained that the mat is too narrow . i wouldn t complain if they made it a little wider but i don t have much trouble hitting it as it is .fits a little tight especially around the front fender and floorboards but it works . i have a shadow ace cc . after a couple rain storms i can report my bike stayed dry except a portion of the front wheel and through heavy winds the motorcycle cover stayed put . what s nice about this cover is the price and how it has elastic hooks to secure the cover in place . if you decide to buy a cover and your bike has a windshield floor boards and aftermarket mirrors i recommend you buy a xl if your bike is similar in size to a shadow cc . look at the picture i posted mine has stock mirrors and no windshield and fits very tight . my mirrors shift out of place when the cover is on . before each ride i have to adjust them cause the cover is soo tight . also if you have floor boards that ll make the fit even more tighter . buying one size bigger and i would say you bike will be covered .
this product does what it is designed to do very very well . it is not used very often but when it is it works beautifully .works great for what it is designed fordoes not work for all guitars . one of my guitars has a more rounded head and it does not fit over that anyway i have tried . though with the arrow shaped holders it works as it should
this is the first masking tape i have used that didn t come off hard when you went to remove it . it came off easily quickly and cleanly with one smooth tug . didn t even tear . i also used it on a drywall that has a vinyl coating to it that i had previously painted it and when i used any other tape it always took some of the paint off when i removed it this left all the paint in tact and on the wall where it is suppose to be . i also tried it on my work desk that was suppose to be real maple wood but when i went to remove some scotch tape from it it took the wood color off like some sort of very thin paper but yet it looked and felt like real wood so until that happened i didn t know it wasn t . well i used this to paint the doors a different color in the middle section to cover where the scotch tape had ruined it and it came off clean didn t take the finish off like the scotch tape . love this and will use it all the time .very clever design . . . wonder why no one did this before . cross between a retractable pen and a highlighter . no more losing highlighter caps or having them on loose and drying out . works as advertisedthe cork board arrived in a damaged state . that wasn t the problem . in fact that allowed me to see how it was constructed . there is an extremely thin layer of cork on top of corrugated cardboard . that is surrounded by a plastic composite frame . drop it and see how easily it damages . i put a push pin into the cork and can see it coming out the back .i m giving it two stars because it is inexpensive and light . in most cases it is good that they don t make them like they used to . not in this case .
these perches are great ! they make a lot of room and are very comfortable for my birds . you can position these perches in any direction any place . they don t have to be straight . this gives them more room and in different directions . it s great ! ! ! ! i have several different size cages . these perches come in different sizes and can be used in any size cage . you can pick any space you feel would be great for your bird s to feel comfortable and twist the perch . all the cages have these perches !i purchased this for my sugar gliders cage . previously i ve purchased wood style perches but they start to stink after a while in a cage of sugar gliders . this perch is washable so i won t have that issue .i wish this had bolts screws to to go into the cage with rather than hooks . i don t feel these are as sturdy and with this perch being somewhat heavy for a small mammel if it falls and hits them they are probably dead ! i had to use multiple zip ties to ensure it didn t get knocked down . so that slows the cleaning process and will add to my expense as i ll have to put new zip ties in every time i remove this for cleaning .as another reviewer noted the gaps are quite large in the wiring so you ll want to ensure its safe for your pet . i don t believe i ll have any issues with this in terms of my gliders getting their heads stuck in them i think they are just large enough that its not an issue for me . but depending on bird size it might be a possible issue .overall i like this and will probably buy more unless i can find something with screws like the wooden perches prevue also sell .works just as i thought . it s sturdy and looks nice . this can be used for almost any bird or small animal cage . it s a nice shelf they can sit on .
this is a great value . i contacted the company for measurements inside the case to see if it would fit an ibanez rg series . it fits perfectly . thank youmanufacturer s website claimed that this case would fit a les paul style guitar . i have an esp eclipse . not even close . chromacast products are great . they need to fix the info on their web page . i m not a fan of shaped les paul cases . too bad .behringer makes quality products i purchased the excellent c condenser microphone and replaced the usb with the xenyx mixer board .when i researched items for a simple home recording setup i saw all of the positive reviews for this smaller mixer and read the item description here on amazon and the behringer website for the c mic included what turned out to be a misleading statement about how it would work with any of the behringer phantom powered mixer boards .that was incorrect information this board receives power only via usb and doesn t provide adequate phantom power for condenser mics v .when i setup the return of this board to amazon i informed of the error and the appear to have acted very promptly on it as the item description for the c on both websites now includes an explicit statement about the need for volts .although this correction is good it would be more helpful to customers if behringer would also correct the description about this board associated with its wording about its phantom power capabilities to state what kinds of mics it will adequately power .i ve noticed in other venues i .e . musician and sound forums behringer gets a bad rap . i don t think its due to poor quality equipment i think its due to frustration about a lack of information provided to customers both before and after the sale . neither the behringer website nor the included documentation with the items i bought is adequate for customers like myself who are not sound experts .
this chair was very useful because the tray and the seat belt really anchors the child into the chair my yr old son already figured out how to get free of typical restaurant high chairs with seat belts . and the height change option is nice to have have not used it yet . the removable white sectional plate and plate cover ended up completely useless for me personally .although i have a basic fisher price booster seat as well as this deluxe booster seat we have children my husband mainly prefers using our brica high chair sear cover with disposable placemats to reduce of big bulky items to bring to the restaurant .grandma was not ready to give up leather seating in her car and wanted something to protect the leather from damage when a booster seat was installed . the prince lionheart two stage seat saver seemed to be what i was looking for . not only was it somewhat more rigid than other seat protectors but it came in tan so that it matched my car s interior . additionally since i live in south texas the lighter color is more desirable for purposes of keeping the vehicle s interior from getting so hot . there should be no issue with the seat saver staining the lighter leather black as based on reviewers comments some other brands do .the prince lionheart two stage seat saver was easy to install . the base filled one of the back bucket seats the seat saver s back needed to have been about longer to completely protect the booster seat back from coming in contact with the vehicle s seat . further it would have been helpful if each side of the prince lionheart two stage seat saver had tabs that extended over the seat back . that would have prevented the booster seat straps from digging into the vehicle s seat when the booster seat was correctly installed . because of the vehicle s seat depth the prince lionheart two stage seat saver s front flap does not bend at the marked area but still provides a bit of protection to the seat edge . having a little one who likes to drum his feet makes me appreciate this feature i do wish the flap had been a bit longer and had multiple grooves for bending .there was no sliding of the britax frontier sict booster seat which was installed on this seat saver the booster seat held firmly in place . the backing on the prince lionheart two stage seat saver is a rubber like mesh similar to the material used to keep floor rugs from sliding . since i have not yet had the seat in place during one of our very hot texas summers i do not know whether there will be a sticking problem . i will probably remove the booster seat during the summer unless our little one is visiting so that i can avoid this potential problem .i would have rated the prince lionheart two stage seat saver a . if that rating had been available . with the exception of the suggested changes i am very pleased with this product .this is such a simple idea and thankfully effective . it isn t huge but it fits our convertible car seat and also the booster one seat protector for each car seat . i recommend it if you want to keep your seats in good shape . a towel works well too but not for boosters .
i have of these and smaller ones . after i learned exactly how and where to place the top onto the base there absolutely has never been a problem . you have to make sure each basket is put exactly in place then make sure that the top basket and top itself with motor are mated perfectly . if the top has to be forced down and or if one or more of the blue clamps requires an unusually high amount of force to close it will leak because the trays were not properly placed or overflowing media or the top tray and the top itself aren t oriented together properly . they are easy to clean hold a large amount of filter material and relatively quiet . water flow and pressure notably good . no bells and whistles but this filter does what you want resulting in clean water .pro easy setupeasy to clean after learning howeasy to change mediaquiet but not silentgood pressuregood water flowit s a basic filterprice for filters in same classcons hard to put back together the first few timesno bells and whistlesaccessories in new models changed when ownership of company changedadditional sponges i would recommend this understanding the above .these extensions fit very well with the aquaclear filters if you have deep tank and want to be able to draw the water from near the bottom of the aquarium . i cut the strainer section off all but the bottom one to get better flow and to make it easier to clean .i ve had a few other common types of power filters and i believe this one is superior simply because you can more easily layer filter media of your choosing into the device without hassle . it can be difficult to use batting or custom cut filters on the type where the filters sit vertically looking down at the filter shows narrow edge of filter square but on this unit they sit flat and water comes up from below . a handful of the heavy biolocal filtration cylinders that come with the filter will hold down other layers . i don t like to use carbon b c we have a lot of plants and this filter allows me to easily cut and use my own filter mesh .also flow rate is very good and somewhat adjustable on this unit .
i have a parakeet cockatiel and a small parrot and the cockatiel size works for all three birds they all like these nutriberries a lotthis perch is bendable so your bird doesn t have yet another straight perch . the cage is inches wide so we got the inch perch to put a double bend in it . our amazon parrot loves it !i have the ph flight cage for my parakeets and this large size cage cover was just the answer ! awesome fit great fabric quality made ! a 
i expected this car seat to be the best . my major complaints are that the material is hard to clean and the seat is way too narrow . my son is months old and is already squished when in the car seat . he does not like being in it at all . i registered for this car seat because i had heard so many great things about peg perego . now that i have been using mine for a few months i think a graco or evenflo is just as good as well as half the cost . i am extremely happy with my peg perego pliko stroller but would recommend new parents to go with a graco or evenflo for the infant car seat .i am bewildered by all of the reviews claiming the toddler bundle me is too small for their children . maybe these people received the infant version instead of the toddler version ? i have a month old daughter that is at the higher end of the growth percentiles and she s got plenty of room in this thing . we received the infant bundle me as a shower gift so i was eager to jump to the toddler version . it s warm fits her jeep stroller perfectly and eliminates the need for many cumbersome layers . very satisfied .this product was recommended for us to use with our son . we ve been using the halo sleepsack since he was a newborn and just getting bigger sizes as he grows . i wouldn t do anything different if we had another kid . great product .
i have a ford f fx that has most every option including the mirrors with the turn signal indicator lamps immediately below the side mirrors . i researched these trailer mirrors and although every formal resource including the one from amazon and the manufacturer said this was not the trailer mirror for my truck i found one review that said they took a chance and they fit and worked fine . i had the same experience they worked fine . there are cut outs that allowed the turn signal lamps to fuction perfectly fine and the shape of the mirror was a perfect fit ! !this makes it so easy to charge in conjunction with my battery tender . so far it has fit all my vehicles batteries acura integra toyota tundra toyota pickup these kc s light up dark lonely places with brilliant far reaching white light even better than i had imagined they would . install was easy on my jk using smittybilt brackets . the switch works great adjustment of the beams was easy positive with a mm wrench for the horizontal a mm socket extension for the vertical . antenna interference with the passenger side light was avoided by angling the antenna back behind the light . nice product !
bought this because i wanted to measure the length of a specific body part of mine . unfortunately a ruler was too big to measure the length of it . i needed something very small in order to figure out how long it is .these jack stands are pretty well made . and very light . they do the job and offer adequate height adjustment . only criticism is that the base is fairly small for its size and could get a little wobbly if the jack is extended to its maximum height . i haven t had a problem yet so this concern may be unwarranted . i use these stands with hockey pucks for protection of my car s frame . they fit nicely on top of the supports . i would buy these again for sure .fits on my hi lift jack just fine . does exactly what it is supposed to do .if you are using it on wheels that are deep make sure the straps are long enough to reach the spoke pattern .
this mighty bright is great ! ! ! ! it clips to my music stand has battery power or ac adapter included and lights up the entire music stand with very little glare . if you need a light for reading music or for just reading this is it . . . . . . . . .this is the american dj micro galaxian red green laser . it is the smaller version of the galaxian laser with the same laser power output but a smaller beam spread . it is a compact well built unit with a power switch on the back and a small fan to keep it cool . the small power cord plugs into the back of the unit and has a transformer block on the end of the cord . it comes with a remote that works great but has an antenna to pull up if needed which seems like old technology . the remote has buttons which allows you to select auto sound mode blackout color and direction of rotation . when going through the color modes you can select red green red green together or red green changing and flashing . you can select auto mode or sound mode so it will go with the music . there is also a speed control knob on the back of the laser to have the dots stop completely move very fast or slow . the darker the room the better but you can easily see it in any room with the lights on . i am very pleased with it . i havent tried it with fog but i know it would look great since it has beams . it will work great for any dj to use on the dancefloor wall or ceiling . this is a great buy under .pros it is small bright well built and works great . it has a remote to control it .cons transformer on cord and antenna on remote .disapointed . the sensors are not providing a clear full bright sound . it sound muffled . i will have to replace it soon .
the title says it all . what a mess ! black hands just unpacking the box . marineland could use a plastic bag inside the box .the picture shows a box however my pads came in a plastic wrap . i prefer the box since it can double as storage and dispenser .the specifications state x . x . inches . with the wheels it measures . in height . of course it will not slide into my pantry at that height .now i either place it outside in an unsightly plain view position or drag it in and out of the pantry . i will bet in a few months that the unit breaks after pushing and pulling since the plastic is sort of brittle . the corners of the wheels are flimsy and not engineered well enough for the added stress of daily maneuvering where the wheels attach to the unit .seriously pass this if you are on the bubble of a decision .
notice in the name guitar input . this is not to be confused with the amplitube irig which achieves input and output through the ipad ios devices headphone jack . headphone connections can be noisy and have reliable connection problems . they also depend on the built in ad da converters in the ipad ios device . this apogee jam k is a professional quality input device that has dedicated a d analogue to digital converter but depends on the built in hardware of the ipad ios device for playback . on the other hand apogee one has both ad and da convertors for both input and output .amplitube irig from ik multimedia has a simple stereo headphone in and out jack plug that plugs into your ipad . the built in hardware in the ipad is something that i love for doing something like watching a movie cozying up to the inch screen but for audio phile quality you need a dedicated a dedicated pre and ad convertor and that is what this apogee jam k has . mind you it has that for audio recording input but playback is handled via your headphone jack on your ipad . you can of course just use that for monitoring your mix and then save the file in a digital format internally and send to a playback device with pristine digital audio quality e .g . saving as a .wav file . this makes the apogee k jam a very usable device to achieve high quality recordings at a very nice price .so here it the continuum . amplitube irig for headphone jack input and output quality built into your ipad etc . the apogee jam k for digital quality conversion on input only with playback being handled by headphone jack on ipad . the apogee one on the other hand at roughly times the price gives you both ad da conversions so it has its own audio output jack plus tracks of recording either instrument and or a balanced external microphone jack . it also comes with a built in condenser mic that is pretty amazing . it also has volt phantom power for using your favorite condenser mic . when you get into the apogee duet and quartet you get more connections plus the all too important option of midi connectivity .this unit works as advertised . i ve used it to record my garage band shows . making a simple recording and transferring it to a computer for storage and playback is easy to accomplish for a novice . buyers should bear in mind that the unit records ambient sounds e .g . audience and any other background noise so if you want a more pure sound you should record directly to a computer through a mixer or other interface to instruments microphones etc .this mic works great for recording vocals on my mac using garage band . i also wanted to use it on my xbox to play guitar hero and rock band but it s not recognized by either game as a mic . that was surprising since it s a usb mic . it is a tiny mic it ll fit completely on your palm but it can record very loud noises very clearly . it is also very sensitive when set to room recording . excellent product .
product was just as described and my turtle will enjoy as he has done the last many years . thank you .i bought all of these items for christmas . this is the one that survived ! will stick with this material and buy againjust as described . product works great for my purposes . transaction was a breeze .my fishtank loves these ! ! i have turtles tropical fish and frogs that all devour this food ! !
does the job ! it s basic tubing that fits tightly around the air pump outlet and air stone inlet . good length .this piping works great . it does everything its supposed to do . fits nicely on my air pump and my aerating stone .they fit my aquaclear . it s a snug fit but they fit . great for extending the intake tube as far down as possible .
i welded a piece of flat stock on the insert for the motorhome . this adapter is for my dodge grand caravan .exact fit for lexus rx . as easy to install as i could ve expected with all parts the sensor the cable and the plug matching the original layout .the drop on this hitch is exactly what i needed for my dodge ram . it makes hooking up my trailer a breeze .
read some good i think articles about antifreeze and this stuff . i am going to try it out . i do a lot of low speed low rpm jeeping here in the four corners area and hope to not have engine heating problems .i have had these levels on campers now and they ve worked great for both units . the inches indicator appear to be accurate . if it tells me i m from level i add x boards and i m then level . if it says i m from level then a x board makes it perfect . these levels make it very simple to set your camper up properly . . .no guessing .wouldn t allow accuracy to read numbers below lbs . my husband is lazy and i can t tell what the dog is saying . . .and i don t get an accurate reading from husband .
i believe in good pet food . have used wellness for years for both dogs and cats . my cat likes beef but not seafood . go figure . this is her fav .it smells like salmon cats enjoy it with their food even though it says it s a dog supplement i think it s just regular fish oil for both cats and dogs . just slightly larger since we have cats they consume it fairly quickly .as a person with severe arthritis who has experienced very positive health benefits from my own use of fish oil supplements i knew that a product such as this would definitely be of benefit to my little companions as well . i use this grizzly salmon oil for both of my pets a doxie toy poodle mix and a young savannah cat that are both fed a raw food diet . because of cost and possible contaminants i don t ever feed them raw fish i add this to supplement their mostly chicken beef menu . both love the taste and are more interested in their meals since i added the salmon oil . after a month s use my pups coat is much softer and as others with cats have reported my kitty s coat feels just like mink .i d recommend storing the bottle in the refrigerator to help it retain freshness .
i have this paired with the behringer c studio condenser microphone . it matches the mic well color wise and fit . the c fits the mount perfectly . i recommend this mount highly .http www .amazon .com behringer c studio condenser microphone dp b cz rlk ref sr ?ie utf qid sr keywords behringer c i retubed my carvin x combo with a duet of mullards and of these eh preamp tubes . wow they all come to life and make the amp sizzle . the price was right from amz .this was one of two i purchased . also bought the length and used them on an assignment recently . they fit my rode mic nice and tight other cords i have bought didn t and the sound quality is excellent . if amazon allowed a link i would give you a link to a video i just finished on the independence of the seas . go to my website and look for it . . .ipa impress dot com
it a belt . . . it fits it hold and it rotates . there is no noise coming from it .happy with the fit and performance .even though amazon says it does not fit my truck it does fit my chevrolet hd crew cab with . l gas engine . i replaced both sensors and harness . both sensors were rough looking and the rear sensor had standing water on it . it was a little bit of a chore to get to them because you have to remove the intake but it was not too bad .works just like it needs to . perfect fit for the tailgate on my chevy when the oem clip busted .
i use the zoo med reptile lamp stand in conjunction with the zoo med mini combo deep dome lamp fixture . it works great and i have had no issues so far over the six months that i have owned it . the bottom of the stand slides right under your reptile terrarium . you can adjust the height of the stand depending on how far or close you want the lamps to your terrarium and it also has places to clamp the lamp cords .this inch airstone is perfect for my gallon aquarium !perfect for any small size aquarium . great price . the thermometer temperature is exactly as mine adjustable heater indicated . recommended for everyone .
i use this on my dark grey ford explorer because the ohio license plates are white . this looks very nice on the dark vehicle and i have not experienced any troubles with law enforcement in the state of ohio for the shield being too dark .i purchased this product based on positive reviews by amazon .com customers to restore the rear trim on my buick riviera . while it makes a nice shine back to black did not make the trim black again it remains grey . i expected a more drastic improvement like some of the tire shine products .in fact i tried black magic tire wet on the rear trim and it provides at least as good a shine as back to black .bottom line product is okay but will not by any means restore black trim back to blackthis is great wax ! it truly deserves the gold class name . i use this after the meguiar s ultimate polish . i also have migrated to a in buffer polisher . i used to do all of my polishing and waxing by hand and with the buffer this turns out great . i have an lesabre that is black sapphire in color . before using the polish wax combo it looked more like a darker blue . nothing really deep . after polishing and waxing it now looks like the black in black sapphire . it looks great in the shade as it should and looks beautiful in the sun . there is a nice deep glassy color and i am pleased with the results . the water also beads very nice too .
i have replaced my old tarnished screws with these . they fit great and plenty of screws . i am going to replace all my old screws with these .my old one lasted a long while and it still works . just wanted another one . these tuners are just awesome !good cable and has m et all of our needs . as all of know who use cables only time will tell whether they will last .
i should have listened to the other reviews . i had this for three months and have yet to use it .my son has enjoyed these stacking cups since age months and still at year they are one of his favorites ! they are so simple but he loves them !i had a homemade quiet book when i was a kid and saw some on pinterest . since i don t know how to sew i visited etsy to see if i could buy one from that site . i couldn t believe the prices ! i found this and ordered it for my three kids mos years and years and they all love it . it s pricey but it s good quality and much easier on the pocketbook than others . great book and i love that all the pieces are attached !
this seems to be one of the better levelers . there are two different scales on these levels . one is for the side to side back of the coach and the other is for the front to back side of the coach . the reason there are different scales are they are more or less calibrated in inches .for example it is simple trigonometry to determine how many inches the coach is out of level simply by using the formula for right angles and solve for one side . the input values are the angle determined by the level and distance from the level to the point at where you want to know how many inches of lift are needed .for the side to side level the markings are pretty accurate as long as you put the scale in the center of the coach as most coaches are within an inch or two of width from another . however for the front to back level even though you put the scale in the center the result will vary wildly due to the length of the coach . using this level on a ft coach will result in a far different measurement than say a ft coach .also if you don t put the level in the center in the side or back then the two ends of the coach will be different . for example if the level is in the center then when the level measures off level that means on either front or back . but if you put the level off center then the level reading might truly be on one end and on the other . again it is simply a principle of right angles in trigonometry .also do not rely on the self adhesive backing as over time it can move . as hard as it may be for you to do drilling a couple holes and inserting screws into the levels is the best bet .the pair of levels are a great value . i recently purchased these for a second time as the originals were sold with my previous trailer and i wanted to make my new trailer easier to get on a level stance .there really isn t much to go wrong as far as product failure is concerned . accuracy is up to you with the initial installation .recommended method of installation is to get your trailer level rv front to back and side to side . once you have your trailer true install the graduated levels in locations which will show you front to back level placed on the side of the trailer and side to side place on the front or back of the trailer . make sure the bubble indicates level by being in the center point of the tube .installation should be done once all your components are stressed as they will be for trailer rv use i .e . front tongue on a travel trailer all the normal weight sitting on the winch foot or in the case of th wheels motorcoaches landing gear down try to place the levels on the rv in clear view of the winch landing gear controls to enable leveling without having to relocate to a different location to view the levels .i accomplished this on a travel trailer by placing one level on the very front center and the other on the side of the frame tongue close to the winch . though small with sharp eye sight you can take advantage of the one on the front of the trailer as you position the trailer to see if you can establish a level side to side stance as you near your desired location .on my th wheel my landing gear controls are on the front corner of the main body . i placed one on the side of the rig for front to back level and another right around the corner on the front side for side to side level still within sight of the controls as well as from the truck cab for backing up . even though the level is off center if it is installed properly with the trailer level at the time of installation it will work fine .as far as the graduated scales are concerned you will have to find your scale for adjustments as it depends on where the levels are placed in reference to the center of the pivot points .the levels come with a self adhesive foam strip on the back for placement as well as two holes for screws if you wish to drill holes in the side of your rig . i go with the adhesive strip route as i don t like unnecessary holes . the only negative with the adhesive strips is they will flex if stressed and it can put the levels off level though this only happened to me with the first pair after the foam tape aged a few years .one last comment . . .the green bubble tube will fade from extended uv exposure . it will not interfere with the accuracy just makes it a little harder to read .if you are looking for larger levels which can be read from a distance i know they are out there but i have no experience with them to make a comparison . i do not wish to clutter the appearance of the rig with large levels .the install is easy just level your camper using a carpenter level of feet or longer . set the level from side to side on your smooth flooring or counter top . then set the level from front to back the same way on the smooth flooring or counter top . now position the hopkins levels one on the side you prefer to work from at the front of the camper on a flat vertical surface . do the same on a side wall near the front corner on a smooth vertical surface . use the double stick tape to position but consider adding pop rivets or small screws to hold the setting for many years . holes are provided in the hopkins levels .use the front level first to drive onto leveling ramps or boards then use the side level along with the tongue jack to finish after you unhitch . extend your stabilizer jacks and you re set for level comfortable sleeping in your camper .
what a pain to to remove the cover and does not fit some plug types . only the smallest plugs will work like lamp plugs not not thick cords like computer plugs . xbox ps etc are out of of the question . you can replace computer cables with thinner lower grade cables to get around this .i had a couple major issues with this outlet cover . the screw that probably is in your existing wall outlet covers is not long enough to accommodate this outlet cover . they made it much thicker than the outlet cover it replaces so for me i need to go purchase a handful of screws . box is not big enough to accommodate anything except basic small two prong plugs . so what won t fit ? our laptops our phone charger samsung galaxy has a small box that plugs into wall ipod chargers computer charger power strip plug light dimming plug attached to lamp dslr charger baby sound machine verizon fios plugs . well crap . . . what appliance plugs did fit you ask ? a lamp . just one lamp . oh and the electric toothbrushes .useless sending them back . the safety st units are square not pyramid shaped and hold various plugs .this fits a very specific style of power strip . fully straight single row .
it is easy to use and it tunes multiple instruments . it works better than my piano . i can trust that i will be in tune .i use these with ernie ball regular slinkies . i find that if you stay right in the middle then you can play a very wide variety of styles . it s also cheaper .i ve been playing guitar more than years and have used a lot of electronic tuners . the first was slightly larger than a paperback book and cost what a cheap guitar sells for today . but it was a godsend tuning up backstage while another band was playing . over the years tuners have gotten smaller cheaper and easier to use . the planet waves pw ct is my new favorite .it is very small a little bit larger than a grape . despite some of the other reviews i have used it with good results on a strat tele les paul and es electrics and on acoustics from martin gibson national resophonic and voyage air . i clamp it on the headstock between the nut and the low e tuner . i didn t expect it but it is out of the way enough to leave on while playing . previous to this my favorite tuner was a chromatic ukulele tuner built to clamp on the top of the headstock . small and accurate but to use it behind the headstock i have to read it upside down . the pw ct is nicely out of the way even when i play an f chord with my thumb on the low e string . it s so light i don t notice it s there .the display is bright and easy to see in most light . a bit hard to read in direct sunlight but i do my best to avoid playing without shade anyway . the display is small a dime can cover most of it but the characters are large enough to read in normal playing position . the sharp symbol is small but once you are familiar with the display you recognize it . no flat symbol . bb is displayed as a . the tuner has auto shutoff to make the battery last longer . the display uses bars to the side of the note letter and color to indicate tuning . it s red until you get close then green with a bar on each side when you are in tune for example e . i found it to be stable enough to be easy to use for quick tune ups between songs .these are inexpensive and intended to be discrete so the clamp is small and thin . rough handling will probably break it . i notice that the clamp is easily removed so i m guessing planet waves may sell replacements . the clamp was not intuitive the first time but the instructions do cover it . it is a ratchet rather than a clamp . you press a small tab and gently pull the clamp out then push it down on the guitar neck . for this reason this is not a tuner to pass around . it s meant to be left on an instrument . it s small enough that you can leave it on in the case . if you need a tuner that is moved frequently there are better and larger choices . it can be moved but it is a good tuner to set and forget . i m going to buy a couple more to leave on my most frequently used guitars .other reviewers commented on accuracy . if you want strobe accuracy there are better choices . for that kind of accuracy you also need a larger display . this tuner will get you close quickly and you can use your ears to fine tune if necessary . i haven t had a problem except with guitars that have built in intonation problems like old nationals and they need tweaking even after a peterson strobe .soapbox especially if you are a new player do yourself a favor and learn to tune your guitar by ear ! try tuning the strings to a reference pitch or each other then use the tuner to check . learning to tune by ear will help you in more ways than i have time to list . being able to hear the intervals in a chord and know which string is off is an invaluable skill . people that can only tune with a tuner will take much longer to develop that if ever .
these manila envelopes are big enough to fit letter size paper . they re thick and don t feel flimsy but the glue doesn t hold evenly along the flap . they do seal well enough to mail but it looks cheap the way parts of the flap will hang loose . if you need the clasp more than the seal these envelopes will do just fine . there s nothing wrong with the clasps .i m not quite sure how to review these dividers . they re what you d expect . they . . . divide . they seem durable the punched holes are reinforced the tabs are a good size to be clearly visible and they come with extra tab inserts in case you can t make up your mind between expenses and outgoing . they will do the job little troopers that they are . it s true they re not flashy or showy but sometimes the homey virtues are the best .these are great very well designed boxes . they are perfectly sized to hold letter size files if loaded in one direction and legal size files if loaded in the other . they are very sturdy and will last forever barring water and critter damage . you can load them up without the bottoms coming apart and stack several of them fully loaded on top of each other don t know quite how high without fear of collapse . they are not even bad looking with the wood grain motif and a white space to label them on the ends . and they arrive unfolded so they store flat until you actually need them . there are very clear directions on each box as to how to fold them properly for use without tape or other fasteners . there is a reason these are used by lawfirms and bankers ? for records storage . they are a good product .
does a fine job . only had to do it once last season . we ll see how it works on a full seasonthis is a great wax . i live in chicago so weather can be kind of crazy . this wax lasts about washes for me until i need to reapply more .great price and is what i was expecting it to be and do . not sure how long it will last time will tell .
we have the older model without the rubber pop up helper and better latch and this new version as well . it is much improved .safety st makes several nail clippers for babies including model safety st hospital s choice steady grip nail clippers model safety st complete nail care set which includes what seems to be clippers similar to model but with a holder at the back for emery boards and model this one . all three of these nail trimmers are in the hospital s choice series .overall i prefer the model see customer images because it is more comfortable to hold for the following reasons . first instead of a small white plastic bulb the has a larger white and orange or white and blue handle that allows you to hold the clippers like a gun with your index finger under the blades and your thumb on the lever . second the orange or blue part of the handle is soft and less slippery than the white plastic of this model . third the lever has the same soft orange or blue non skid rubbery material at the end thus providing a cushion for your thumb .in terms of cutting nails the very good performance of this model and the are the same . they both leave the nail edges a little sharp so some filing is necessary . so i recommend purchasing the instead .my little one seems to prefer the softy spongier teethers . this is colorful and has all sorts of textures but shen she gnaws on it there is no bounciness to it and she is not as interested in it as she is with other teethers . maybe as she gets older and stronger she will like it more .
i have two medium sized dogs who each have one of these . the souper size lasts them for many months as they are power chewers . the smaller sizes only last a few weeks . this is hard but not as hard as a real beef bone and is kinder to teeth and gums . they also enjoy just carrying these around in their mouths but i have to be careful i don t get one dropped on my bare foot ! these don t break off in litle pieces or slivers and are easy to clean if my dogs play with them in the dirt . i will definitely buy these again .i have a toy breed dog and was a little perplexed at the scale of grooming tools at the pet stores . at first when the comb arrived i was shocked at the small size then i remembered it is four inches ! this was the perfect size . my puppy is lbs poodle shih tzu and she s not alarmed by the comb when i bring it near her as she is when she sees the scissors but that is another story . it is small enough that i can comb the hair on her tiny face and on the brigde of her muzzle which can t be more than inches . i can get the eye crud dirt flecks out of her fur with this comb . it is sturdy and durable . i ve ad it for a couple months and use it once a week at least and don t expect that the teeth of the comb will bend or warp it is that sturdy .like most other reviewers here i found this finger toothbrush to be very hard to use .i would say i have average size hands for ex i wear a size medium adult male snowboarding glove .the finger toothbrush has a very large opening way too large for my fingers . and for my wife not a chance she could get it to stay on her finger .the bristles are too short and very close together . i don t think it really scrubs anything .i am going back to using a regular style toothbrush like the ones humans use . i have found that a toothbrush made for a baby works pretty well on dogs small dogs like mine .
this review is for the universal bedside co sleeper which is exactly the same as the original except it s sized for beds that are inches tall the original is sized for beds that are inches tall and taller .after only a few weeks of using a traditional high sided cradle for our baby who gets up to nurse several times in a night we decided that we needed something to make moving the baby between her bed and ours easier . we chose the bedside co sleeper and we haven t been disappointed .the low side of the co sleeper is level with our mattress and the mattress of the co sleeper is about inches lower than that . this means that when my baby wakes in the middle of the night to nurse i only have to lift her four inches to get her into my bed . i don t even have to sit up to manage this . plus since there are no bars or slats between her bed and mine when she s fussy at night i can easily reach out a hand to soothe her or find the pacifier she s let slip from her mouth . the four outside pockets one on each short end and two on the long end are convenient for holding burp cloths extra diapers baby wipes etc everything i need for late night feeding and changing .some reviewers have complained that the mattress is too hard . actually i found that the mattress is padded but lumpy . this is because it s designed to fold up so the co sleeper can be portable and fit into a travel bag . i solved the problem by putting a quilted multi use pad on top of the mattress underneath the fitted sheet . the quilting helped smooth out the lumps and make the mattress more comfortable without making it so soft that i m worried about a smothering hazard . also the pad is good protection for the mattress in case of nighttime accidents since the mattress is made only of cloth with no plastic cover unlike typical cradle mattresses . be sure to buy at least one extra fitted sheet when you purchase the bed one is included with the bed itself since regular crib or cradle sheets won t fit .my only complaint so far is that the solid fabric sides of the co sleeper prevented me from hanging my baby s crib toys on the bed . otherwise i ve found this bed to be an absolute lifesaver and the only kind of infant bed i would recommend .we registered for the ultimate crib sheet because a cousin and a few friends raved about it they said to get two so that one could be on the crib and one could be in the wash . i received it at my baby shower but we have found only limited value in this crib sheet for our month old daughter . i am glad we only have one of these !the ultimate crib sheet that we have is the style with elastic straps on each corner one fully removable elastic strap in the center of the short end and two straps on each long end . we have a pali wendy in convertible crib and the corner posts are quite thick to the point where the elastic straps are not long enough to easily go around the corners . instead on one end of the crib we have to resort to wrapping the straps around the crib slats adjacent to the corner posts and that means there s slightly less than full coverage of the sheet underneath . since our daughter is a perimeter sleeper who likes to be up against the edges of her crib that is a problem .the majority of parents we know have purchased convertible cribs which have thick corner posts when configured as a crib or toddler bed . it would be easy for summer infant to make this sheet more adaptable to current crib styles by making the length of the corner straps longer or using multiple snap sockets to make the strap length adjustable . this sheet fits better on a standard traditional crib with thinner diameter corner posts .i also question the real value of this for older babies who move around in their cribs . we have the crib bumper on now despite not having used it between months of age because she is a real mover and likes to stay on the perimeter of her crib to sleep she was sticking limbs out between crib slats and woke up crying as a result . on the handful of occasions where she s thrown up in her crib always when she s come down with an upper respiratory bug she s inevitably hosed the bumper as well . in those cases we have to just strip the whole crib anyways so the ultimate crib sheet is of little real utility for us .i could see this being a big time saver for parents with traditional cribs or those with babies toddlers who often have various accidents in their cribs and need to frequently change a crib sheet on the fly . however we have found that a waterproof pad under a normal crib sheet works just fine for our baby .this fits our crib mattress tightly and keeps our baby from sweating against the vinyl of the crib mattress . we didn t have a mattress pad with our son and he would wake up soaking wet from sweating against the vinyl of the crib mattress . the crib sheet alone wasn t enough to keep him from sweating . this pad is also not too bulky so it doesn t cause a safety concern . just make sure the pad fits tightly on your crib mattress for safety s sake . we have a sealy crown jewel mattress and it fits great on it .
i was using seachem prime for the longest time and since i have large tanks s c safe was the way to go . . . oz will last you for years being a typical one tank owner . . for gallon bucket mix use only of a teaspoon i mean only . very strong . . order from amazon . norpro mini measuring spoons piece set . . i rate this product . you will go through . of prime before this is long empty . update i have made over gallons of aquarium water now with no issues . not one dead or ill fish . no issues with my gallon cichlid tank my gallon cichlid tank and my gallon angel fish tank .enjoy streamwood the cichlid king i had two tetra gallon rating and wanted to get a stronger one . got this and this one is weaker than the ! the outperformed this rated gallons ! on the and gallon tank ! so i now have two tetra powering a gang valve supplying airlines total to a and gallon tank . the is left to work on the gallon tank !save money and get the tetra instead !i ordered two of these for my gallon fish tank they re very nice airstones !
one of the best stands in the industry ! fits any guitar banjo or even a cello . good construction and easy to put together .how can you beat that !very sturdy stand made to last a lifetime . easy enough to adjust and can hold a lot of weight . cannot go wrong with this one .wow a bench that really holds my ass . what can i say about it you really need it with the keyboard stand . and it was necessary to the group .
the kneeler is not very sturdy . i was not comfortable kneeling on it and i felt like my weight would break right through the flimsy little styrofoam like cushion . if that is what the manufactorer considers cusioning i m not impressed . i might as well kneel on a folded towel . i was hoping for something that would be soft . also the construction of the item is not very sturdy . it is made of plastic and it does not seem at all durable . the elbow quot cushion quot is also not very soft . it is not secure either . when i leaned against it to test it it slid right off . if i d been busy bathing my baby i would have tumbled into the tub with him . i don t recommend this product .i previously used a set that featured sculpey material to make hand and foot print casts . the sculpey material is a little firm and with those soft little baby hands i was too nervous to push them hard into the material so i only got fairly shallow impressions .with this set the babyprints brand the material is different . you don t bake it it just air dries . it is much softer so you can get a deeper nicer casting . however it seems to stay a little soft even after setting . i m not sure whether it will survive the ages as well as the sculpey stuff does .when it arrived i know i am satisfied with this pillow . it soft thick . i like the purpose of the belt too . it is added for baby s support safety . unfortunately there is no cover sheet available . just wipe it with wet cloth you will be fine .
bought this charger to replace the rediculous charger that comes with power wheel cars and trucks . had to do some minor wiring connector swaps but this charger is soooo much faster and actually let s me know when the battery is done ! terrific charger i would buy another ! ! ! can t beat the price and functionality . . . . . .the battery tender battery tender plus v battery charger is a best buy . it does everything they say it will do . the add for it is not over blown and it did bring my battery back to life . i am really glad i got it this is a must have if you have a wall charger as the length is great and if your battery is not close to the charger . i use mine for charging my rv truck battery and the house side battery at the same time as i have a battery tender y for charging more than battery . this is heavy duty and works for both my battery tender plus and my battery minder s at a great price . i highly recommend this and the y for or more batteries would buy again and hope this helps someone .

this monitor iis so simple and the features have been extremely useful . first this monitor comes with receivers a must for a two story home . we can hear everything including noise from outdoors . the red lights that blink in accordance to volume are great for those who can t see without glasses esp when waking up in the middle of the night and they are also great if say you have the tv on a bit too loud . the nightlight on the monitor with the minute timer is a great feature b c it doesn t generate heat as does a conventional outlet nightlight bulb . our baby also happens to be disturbed by her outlet nightlight when she wakes up at night and thus won t fall back to sleep easily . therefore we ve used the monitor light . we ve had no problems nor complaints with this product .this monitor has been great i love the fact that it comes with recievers we have one in the family room one in our bedroom works great no static very clear . it is also wonderful that you can see what is happening as well . i can vacuum be able to look at the monitor to check on her i know longer have to worry about if i m going to hear her or not . another great thing is that you can plug it in or put batteries on it . they also have clips so you can take it with you outside or wherever . i highly recommend this monitor .the unit is about feet away from the crib and every sound the baby makes can be clearly heard . it even picks up the sound of the a c unit . i can remain sitting in the chair that s feet away from the unit nursing the baby and ask my sons in the living room where the parent unit is located to bring me a glass a water . i love that the parent unit can be used without batteries .
if i knew how to upload photos of our dog riding the motorcycle with us wearing these doggles . i would everyone luvs it . xsmall is the size for the dog yorkie pd . but small is better because if the dog moves the doggles don t come off the eyes .i love the ease rider car harness . i use it to keep my toy poodle safely in his car seat . i like the fact that when i take my puppy out of his car seat i can just hook on his leash and hi s ready to go for a walk .well how the old story goes you cant get enough of a good thing . after ordering the chuckit which came with only one ball i knew that i would need some back up ! dogs love the game and in time i am sure i will figure out how to throw better !
this comes complete with bridge saddles and full size block . . . and it s fender ! i don t think this is a true steel block . i believe it s zinc alloy but that s fender s fault . the company i bought it from ant hill music via amazon is very honest and likable people . i have nothing but respect for them and bought two of these for squiers . they made my cv s sound fuller with greater sustain . i m sure i ll buy more in the future .i should add it does not come with a whammy bar but your my old squier whammy bars fit perfectly into it !i ve been playing for about years . most on my playing is with a bluegrass band here in columbus ga . my performance guitar is a martin hd and my practice guitar is a blueridge br .i wanted a third guitar just for kicks . i d been looking a taylors but didn t want to spend that much money .enter the seagull s . a fellow picker asked if i d ever heard of a seagull i hadn t he said they were nice guitars and i ought to check them out . so i did a little research . i first read all the nice reviews here for the s and then went on youtube and listened to a few . my guitar is a seagull coastline spruce s and i really like it . i choose not to get the cedar top version because the cedar is soft and i understand that the spruce has more volume . i got the s today and this evening my wife with her taylor gs mini and i with this s played smokey mountain memories . nice real nice guitar .i found that the action on this s is pretty good out of the box . i m going to take it to my luthier tomorrow and have him install a strap pin peg on the heel and take a look at the action at the same time if he can make the action better i ll let him . i m also going to put on some elixir light strings . i don t know what kind of strings are on it out of the box .but the bottom line is that i am very happy with the playablilty and the action of this seagull coastline spruce s acoustic guitar right out of the box . i m glad i bought it .i m a very big fan of david gilmour but never was a fan of ghs s . so i thought i m wanting to step up one gauge to s so why not try these . it took a little longer for them to get stable but my strat and my les paul sound and feel great . now and i didn t see this at first on david s les paul he use s . s and i have a bigsby on mine like his . i may try those next time on my les paul . i m not sure how they will work on a epiphone les paul cause i have a gibson and there is a big diference . and on the mim s fender s either cause both of mine are american standards . all in all i m very pleased with the dg ghs s . . . .
 later the mic is indeed the behringer c but amazon has provided it with the description belonging to the c u . unlike amazon s description this is not a mic that comes with usb plug phantom power and computer connectivity . and of course none of the advertised included computer software programs is included . it s a conventional studio mic that requires connection to a regular amp p .a . with an xlr jack and phantom power . it will not connect to the usb port of a computer without an expensive adapter and a preamp with phantom power . moreover amazon s form thus far is denying a refund and offering only replacement presumably for another mic just like this one ! if you want the described mic amazon is showing it from a different vendor at about more plus s h . the behringer c mic is the best condenser mic i ve used for the money its large diaphragm capable of reproducing some of the rich and deep sonorities of the costly high end mics at the radio station npr where i occasionally work . however behringer makes a distinction between the c and the c u . the description on amazon fits the c u not the c . so one way or another of the purchasers of this product are likely to be surprised and disappointed .indeed the c u is a phantom powered mic that doesn t require phantom power which it derives from the usb port of a computer . moreover the mic not only saves its owner the bother of a pre amp with phantom power but it also makes unnecessary a costly and time consuming xlr to usb adapter . it s ready to go just plug it into your laptop and start recording . i use sound studio but the included free software audacity works practically as well . on the other hand if the mic is a c as advertised be prepared to receive a conventional condenser mic with an xlr connector and a phantom power requirement found on numerous recording devices and p .a . amps or available on a neat little pre amp sold by amazon the a .r .t . .having just returned a keyboard the m audio pro sx for which amazon mistakenly provided the wrong description for the m audio pro not the pro sx i d be hesitant to place any bets on which mic the buyer will receive the c as advertised or the c u as described . at least if you re purchasing directly from amazon instead of a sub vendor you can be assured of a hassle free return . and if the mistake is due to amazon s description returns are generally postage free .very versatile power supply and much cheaper than others . this is not true isolated outputs but it is quiet and that is what counts . i have the fuel tank chameleon and i end up using this because it fits the needs of the pedals on my board the best mainly because of the ma output . here is a comparison of the jp chameleon and the onespot . i have all three .t rex fuel tank chameleon ma outputs v v maoutput v v maoutput v v ma use or only not bothoutput v ac majoyo sp ma outputs v maoutput dc v maximum output of maoutput dc v maoutput dc v mavisual sound onespot ma v only daisy chain power into pedals not exceeding mai bought this as an interface between my mixer instruments and mics to my macbook for garageband . you have to go in and change the input and output in osx but it works great !
it s funny this product is cheaper than another product on here that has san francisco bay brand in the title . this is the same brand same size same product . good quality minimal dust . helpful tip on the back to soak the worms before feeding .works great as normal . . .wished when they packed the box they would have put this product in a plastic bag as my new book i bought at the same time is black . but the product is great !nice thermometer . has been holding up fine for the past year and is accurate . the suction cup seems to be well made which i have found is often the first thing to go bad on these . good price .
as a lot of epiphone owners have learned cases designed for the gibson es clones won t fit epiphone guitars as the epiphones have a slightly larger headstock . this case however fits my dot custom like a glove . the padding is perfect the top is arched to precisely fit the guitar and the build quality is better than you might expect at this price level .works great with my baritone ukulele . same quality as my full size acoustic guitar capo . easily fits in my ukulele case too .very good item if you are a musician you need it ! cool for any bass guitar and any instrument that fit into the hanger
i am installing these on a chevy avalanche . l v . they are a exact replacement of oem . ac delco all the way . . . good stuff .just a spark plug fits my chinese scooter engine i have a taotao atm a but there are many brands using this same honda clone engine .has a small center pin and the right gapping from the factory .supposedly lasts a long time can t say as i use it as a backup plug .this fits not only the ecotec but newer vw tdi s with the canister filter . works great relatively low profile and goes nicely on a drive . i accidentally ordered three fat fingered the cart and sold one to a fellow vw driver and one to a guy with a gm .
i found a ford . l diesel priced so low i couldn t pass and i knew beforehand it d require certain upgrades to instill natural diesel longevity and i needed a tool to help enter scangauge ii .scangauge ii has features beyond a simple scan tool eg trip computer miles per gallon tank to empty cost per trip horsepower mile time mph wots stopping distance and others . . .neat features but not reason i purchased . . .digital gauges reason the mfr refers to this feature as x gauge screen displays four real time on board diagnostics parameter identifications obdii pids of user choosing pids displayed can be changed via pressing adjacent buttons performance data mpg qtr mile time etc may be displayed together alongside pids displays vehicle mfr generic pids automatically gasoline engine displays diesel mfr pids ie eot ict ipr etc after user creates an x gauge by input data from scangauge websitewith basic knowledge and study i use this gadget to my advantage i mean either repair vehicle myself or know what s wrong exactly what s broken beforehand to preclude somename repair shop ripping me off it s way too common .i think it comes ready to troubleshoot gasoline engines in general yet i d to enter math data avail on website manually for it to sense and display pids unique to diesel .after several days of study application my opinion is this tool will help diagnose with near certainty components which have failed and components in early stage of failure . its ability to depict four pids simultaneously in real time allows comparison between what related pids reflect per desired and actual .also note i found most big name tuners boasting scan ability do not monitor depict many key pids as scangauge a huge shortcoming for tuner price .simply put the scangauge ii is much more than an obdii code reader and it ll be difficult near impossible to find an item offering same diagnostic capabilities for both gas and diesel engines at price .update jan i ve purchased another for my boy s pickup with a . l . we both have sct livewire tuners but due to livewire s monitoring limitations we have scangauges connected full time to monitor key pids .kylei use this often to check the tire pressure on our cars optimal tire pressure means better gas mileage and thread wear . this works fast and is accurate . the only option i wish this had was a beep on completion of check . i have used other gauges that beeps to tell me the test is completed which was a nice feature .this is a must have tool for people who work on their own cars . it seems the oxygen sensor is one of the more common failures that cause check engine codes to appear on the obdii engine and emissions control computer system .
this set of mice are fairly priced . they are nice . kitty is only mildly interested with them . but i recommend them . they are very cute looking .these toys are small but a lot of fun for my cats . they can bat them around so quickly i have to double take to make sure they are not chasing a live mouse ! they are durable and are holding up to being chewed on by the youngest cat that still acts like a kitten ! i recommend these toys !these are the tennis type balls that come with the original chuckit thrower . they re ok but they don t go the distance or have the mouth appeal of the ultra chuckit ball . my yard is littered with these balls and none of my dogs will play with them only the ultra ball or various planet dog balls . plus according to the whole dog journal these colorful tennis balls are laden with chemicals that aren t healthy for your dog . spend the money on ultra chuckit balls they cost more but last longer fly farther and are easy to clean .this product has been rated by two young labs brothers a golden retriever and a beagle .
this gate could have easily been stars but there are a few points that need mention where the gate needs some improvement . if evenflo addresses these this gate will easily merit a top score . let me start with the positives . the gate itself is made of sturdy and aesthetically appealing wood . it works well and looks great if the install goes well and as exactly specified included paper template is great . the mechanical lock latch inspires confidence in that you can actually feel and hear it click into place which gives one peace of mind . of course one hopes that evenflo has determined this type of latch to be one that is not easily defeated by the age group that it was manufactured intended for months to years ! thankfully it does seem like it is up to the task . i also like the fact that the bottom latch receptacle allows for the gate to slide into thus adding reinforcement to both the top and bottom portions of this gate . way to go evenflo ! the negatives about the gate are as follows . in many typical installations there will be baseboard molding trim that may get in the way of installing the bottom most latch receptacle . it did in my case even after carefully measuring the proper clearance from the floor as specified in the assembly directions . thus i wasn t able to get the latch receptacle to clear the molding in order to screw in the bottom screw . i had to thus cut with a hacksaw that portion of the latch receptacle and modify it for my installation . i then was only able to use screw although a larger and longer one than provided instead of to install the bottom latch receptacle . thankfully even just the modified screw installation was very tight and secure going into the door jam wood . evenflo should provide the consumer with at least another type of bottom latch receptacle that allows for better clearance of molding near the floor . besides most typical homes do have some kind of baseboard molding and mine was only high hardly anything large . lastly the assembly directions did not make clear which latch receptacle to use on the top and which on the bottom . they are not the same dimensions as one is thicker than the other top latch receptacle is thinner than the thicker bottom one . of course the aforementioned latch receptacle install challenge may not even apply to you for your installation especially if you don t have floor baseboard molding . in summation this gate is sturdy and excellent and a good value . please just make sure you do install it correctly as per the instructions and never leave your baby alone unsupervised . these gates are meant to be used with proper supervision and never as a replacement for .we are veterans of many types of gates for both dogs and now kids and i am crestfallen that it took us this long to discover this terrific model . it combines the security of a permanent mount with the relative ease of installation and occasional portability of pressure mounted models .i had two irregular doorways to fill in with child gates so our scootching month old could play safely in the area . for one large opening i used the superyard gate which is a decent all plastic telescoping gate with permanent mounting rails and for the other i used the first years hands free with a single extension . after seeing how secure the first years was and how incredibly east it was to install the extensions even though i m happy with the superyard gate i wish i had bought two first years hands free the operation is really cool you step on a pedal and knee the thing open . it works in both directions ! i was skeptical the pedal was baby proof but letting my son who is the median weight of a two and a half year old put his full weight on it didn t budge it a bit . the design is also very attractive nice thin white metal instead of the usual lattice work plastic on most gates .one comment on an earlier negative review where the grandparent indicated their month old could pull up the foot pedal this cannot open the gate if the top is properly tightened ! see below . i tried this and the pedal will slide but not allow the gate to open if the top is tight .i have only a few minor caveats to convey when installing it make sure you follow the instructions and use the little plastic wrench included to do some fine tuning tightening so that the upper latch is the required distance from the catch a wrench width . this is easy to do and i found that when i tightened it up as the instructions indicated the good fit of the latch became excellent even with a slightly irregular from vertical door post . the opening might be a little narrow compared to some other gates it took a bump or two on my calf to get the hang of nothing terribly difficult or painful . the extension might not be necessary if you have an opening that s right on the cusp of the suggested door opening if you have an opening right around the maximum i d recommend installing it without the extension first to avoid having to make a return for a possible un needed extension . installing and de installing the extension as i noted is a piece of cake . this is not portable the way a simpler gate is but can be de installed and re installed in less than two minutes . since it swings open if you want to use the gate in only one location the portability isn t an issue .all in all just about the coolest gate i ve used .this gate is really a great product . i love the fact that you don t have to hardware mount the gate no drilling into the doorways required and it s still very sturdy . it was incredibly easy to install and is very safe and secure . my month son knows how the gate opens but cannot open it because of the weight required to push down on the lever . the only negatives i encountered were the first hands free gate i purchased was not painted properly so i had to return it for another one . i had to buy the quot gate extension for the gate to fit in the doorway . so in the end there are additional costs if the opening you intend to use the gate for is not that narrow . but all in all it s totally worth it .
decent price for all necessary colors and genuine canon ink cartridge . also comes with a pack of photo paper .i use the cli y yellow ink tank for my canon ip . all my ink tanks typically get used up at almost the same rate on the canon ip so i usually just order thecanon cli color multipack ink tankspackage which consists of magenta cli m this ink tank cyan cli c yellow cli y andcli bk black . if you need all colors the canon cli color multipack ink tanks is a much better deal . quality the cli ink tanks produce pleasing tones and true to life colors for photos . i find that the high quality photo prints rival those from the photo lab .compatibility the cli c cli m cli y and cli bk ink tanks are compatible with the canon ip and mp inkjets . do not confuse these ink tanks with the closely named cli p ink tank series cli pc and cli pm these ink tanks are not necessarily compatible with your printer . if you have a tank printer chances are the cli pc and cli pm aren t compatible with your printer !value i stint on ink and print my documents almost exclusive in grayscale at the draft quality mode my canon ip printer uses the cli color cartridges even though i don t print in color . i can get about a full ream s worth of paper double sided on cartridge . however with higher quality printer the color ink cartridges get consumed much more quickly .it is evident from the reviews that the price of ink is a major concern for most people . you should ideally use only genuine canon ink cartridges but if you re strapped for cash you can purchase the cheaper generic versions non oem of the cli cartridges . cli pack cli magenta lt non oem equivalent of this cartridge canon cli m cli cyan cli yellow cli blacki have not verified that they do in fact work as claimed so try them at your own risk !bottom line the canon cli c m y bk ink cartridges may be expensive but they deliver consistently high quality text and photo prints .i bought these canon pgi bk pack pigment black ink tanks for my canon ip pixma printer .pros reliabilitythese ink cartridge are very reliable . i ve yet to encounter a fail ink cartridge that the printer has to reject ink usageat the lowest quality mode i can print about a ream s worth of paper double sided .cons expensive inkthese printer cartridges are expensive . my printer usescyan cli c magenta cli m yellow cli y also sold as amultipack and the two black cartridges pgi andcli black also sold as amultipack .since my printer uses all of the color ink cartridges at about the same rate even in grayscale mode the price of ink cartridge replacements can be a lttle steep . i ve never had a problem with the canon pgi bk ink tanks . the main gripe i have is the high price ink cartridge replacements .
i put these in my tj jeep wrangler . they fit perfect and work exactly as you d expect they should . i installed a set of w hids in them and the light output is tremendous .they do work . exactly as advertised . hane no fear on buying these . fit the chevy silverado wt tailgate rods .works just like it needs to . perfect fit for the tailgate on my chevy when the oem clip busted .
just opened my mail and a . inch long air hammer bit is what i measured . not the . inch as the ad says on amazon .com . hope it still works out ok . i wanted longer one that would reach into the hollow van sliding door as well as the hollow rear side panel . it s a nickle coin size and flat on the impact end . i was looking for a arched shape but this will do ?i attached these to my travel trailer . this product makes it easy to level both front to rear and side to side .this item works very well . it has a really bright l .e .d light and setup is super easy . i think some folks recieved a knock off and therefore you might need to varify items part number and maybe even upc number before ordering anywere online . make sure it says maxsa on the package and you have the correct one .it is very easy to setup i measured our car first . our infiniti from dash center were i wanted laser to the front bumper was about ft . i then measured in my garage were i wanted the cars dash to be when i parked witch came out to be approx ft from front wall . thats ft to ft for mower and walking space in front of car .mine ended up being located in front of my garage door opener so my cars about feet in my garage door when it detects it . that way it will light up just before i get to parking location i chose and laser wont stop shining before i park like some reported .my door opener dont seem to interfere with sensor even though its located between door and laser . its a good sensor imo . i aimed the laser on the center of my dash using a long stick while car was parked and the way i have it as long as the light is on the dash area rather all the way forward centered or on the the edge of the dash the cars clear and your parking is fine .since my laser is just above the center of the dash area and points straight down on the dash area it leaves about a foot in either direction front or rear for some error . it seems to work well like this . it took about min total to setup .caution wives husbands may act like they dont need a garage laser and it was a stupid waste of money . even when they choose to drive your truck to work everyday because they dont want to pull thier car in out of the garage before this was installed . this will pass soon as long as you never mention it was for them again . never mention it again ! ! ! !
i have no complaints about this bag at all . i use the small front zippered compartment as my purse and it does have coin compartment credit card slots etc . i love the little clip on the outside . . . i use that for spare pacifiers for quick access . avent bottles and playtex sippy cups fit well in the side pockets . the bottles have to go on the mesh side though . . . that side s slightly larger . the bag is stain resistant and has stayed clean over the past year .this is a handy little diaper holder . it holds wipes and diapers and the compartments on the sides hold miscellaneous items . i wish the side compartments which are removable were more sturdy but other than that it s fine .i picked this storage box up after exhausting myself trying to find an easy to maneuver and safe toy box for my toddler s toys without spending a fortune canvas bins baskets with liners etc . . it is not an heirloom wooden toy box but really serves the purpose and looks better in our living room than a rubbermaid bin or a series of open top baskets . it is roomy has a soft lid that you can either use closed or tuck behind . the sides have mesh pockets for books and the tote bag fits into one side after putting in divider . the sides and divider that velcros inside to divide into sections would probably bend if the baby smashed into them stood on them etc . but the plus side for me is that she cannot turn it into a stepladder because it is somewhat pliable . for the price it cannot be beat and provides good temporary toy storage .
this little amp is amazing . it s loaded with a lot of samples of other great amps and you can plug it in to your laptop and record it directly and you can go online and download other samples directly to your amp . i love it ! if you need a practice amp and you can plug your headphones in to it so you can practice in private then this is the amp you should buy . the price is right and the size is right . enough said . buy it !at this price how can you go wrong ?comfortable and sturdy .works just fine thank you .bought another for my strat .it connected well in the nady smps x phantom power unit i bought ! i ll update how i hook it up ! check !
i use this for my portable changing pad and under the sheet in my daughters cradle . it is a bit wide for my cradle so i just tuck in the sides . it is wide for the portable changing pad but still works good !this works well with the contour changing pad . it fits a little snugly so the corners of the pad don t exactly stay as pointy as they were when it was new but it works very well . it works even better if you cut the straps off the changing pad . you re right there with baby anyway .this pad fits my arm s reach co sleeper great . i bought this to put between the mattress and sheet . the pad gives it more cushion and will absorb any leaks if they happen . i washed it and the pad washed great .
my son never used these . . .since he is a boy and the ones i received were pink . . .so i can t attest to whether he liked them or not .maybe it s just me but colors may vary just doesn t fly with baby stuff unless all the colors are neutral .i took a chance because the price can t be beat . well it didn t pay off . playtex makes some very girlie cup designs and wouldn t you know it that s what we got for our son . if you have a daughter go for it . even the boyish designs are fun for a girl . i don t even think i would call them boyish more gender neutral . i kept these for an upcoming shower gift but it s not worth the chance i ll get another set of pink butterfly cups .a gender selection option should be provided . girl boy neutral i m having a baby girl but wanted a different color since there is so much pink in her closet so didn t want any more pink . decided to go with the sage and it looked like a light green online but when we received it it was a different darker green than what is shown . besides the color i d recommend this product . i have quite a few clothes that needed sorting and baby isn t due for another weeks but once baby gets here i didn t want hubby to just go in and pick anything thus the need for clothes organizers . i m sure if it wasn t for husbands there really would be no need for these . 
these boxes were fairly simple to out together and then had a very sturdy feel to them .i placed hardcover books on top of one of these boxes and it held up without a problem .the only negative is that the ink rubbed off onto my skin as i was folding and pressing the flaps into their slots . the tabs need to be pushed down firmly into place in order to achieve full sturdiness so that they will not come out of place .use disposable gloves .the cart is well made craftsmanship assembly etc . no complaints .my only gripe is that the shelves are to me up side down . i dont want the lip on the shelf pointing upwards . most of my wire shelves have the lip pointing down at the front tip of the shelf . this makes it more convenient to pull out larger jugs off the shelf . i suppose some can argue that the jugs could slip off while one moves the cart so it is better to have the lip pointing up . of the time the cart is stationary for me . only a few times a year i would move it out of the utility room to make more room for carrying bulky things through the utility room . that said i would rather have at least the top and center shelves to have the lip pointing down .it s just a regular stapler . it is made out of recycled plastic so that s nice . it is light weight unlike the ones with the heavy metal bottoms . it says that you can staple up to sheets but i stapled up to without any issues . it is easy to load . it also opens up so you can staple without the bottom attached as well . that is helpful for stapling thin items onto a core board .
i really like that these have a double bottom and they fold open so there is no assembly required .the lids do need to be folded to shape . they fit securely and the tabs fit into the box handles so they lock in and when opening one end the other tab acts as a hinge .if you want to use hanging file folders in the box the lid does not fit as well and you would need to tape them closed . the price of a pack is more than if you were to pick them up at a local office supply but the pack is a good value .in previous years many reviewers complained about the smell of these boxes but the manufacturer must have fixed that problem because they have no odor .this is a second purchase of this product . it is very sturdy . i really like how the envelopes closes . i did not have to use tape to make sure the close did not reopen like some other items do .i got two of these from my local staples . both were defective . the tabs for opening the top would not work . i actually had to search the internet to find out how they were supposed to open as there were in instructions in the box . these came in the original packaging from m .
i use the zoo med reptile lamp stand in conjunction with the zoo med mini combo deep dome lamp fixture . it works great and i have had no issues so far over the six months that i have owned it . the bottom of the stand slides right under your reptile terrarium . you can adjust the height of the stand depending on how far or close you want the lamps to your terrarium and it also has places to clamp the lamp cords .i was building up a gallon tank and needed a nice top . these glass tops are the best they stop a ton of evaporation on a bigger tank probably gallons a week . i have covers on my gallon now too . . .love the glass tops . the plastic in the back is nice too it can be cut to fit anything you have in there .it s very helpful to hold my lamp just above the tank . adjustable and just great . very stable and you can slide the platform right under the tank so it can t move .
perfect thickness and action .what else can i say ? you won t be sorry you got these they are all i ll get from now on .some items of gls work great others are awful . don t trust the products anymore . it s unfortunate but i don t feel safe with their products that they ll perform when i need them to . .ok i don t have much to say just i love it because its cheap nice and i don t know i just feel happy to buy this product
get the large one it s not too large but an appropriate size i would assume after receiving the large one that the small one is quite small . i have a lbs cocker spaniel mix and he loves treats . the quality is great and i have seen at pet stores at a very costly i price .great size for someone with a smaller dog and perhaps a smaller stature . i wouldn t recommend this amended size for a tall person .these are the perfect size for training smaller dogs . but both my labrador and my mini dachshund love these treats .
still a great product it s just a little flimsy . the way the bottom holder attaches to the base is the problem ! it doesn t attach ! it just slides in and then you kinda just hope it doesn t bend or break . the only problem is if you are clumsy like me you might push your guitar down into it a little to hard and damage it .i am using it with a musician s gear music stand . the shelf fits but moves easily when moving stuff on the shelf of the stand . it is made out of plastic which flexes fairly easily and doesn t feel as sturdy as the metal shelf of the stand . there aren t any other options though unless you know some one who can do metal fabrication . it is a good thing it does not cost a lot .this stand was very inexpensive and i thought i could save a bit of money and give it a try for use with my epi sheraton ii . unfortunately i am just not all that comfortable trusting my guitar to this stand . it seems to be built well enough for what it is but it seems quite unbalanced and always on the verge of tipping backwards . also for left right stability you need to set the guitar just so in the bottom support piece or it seems tippy .the construction itself is ok . the rubber tips on the feet seem fine but the front legs seem overly long with the rear foot overly short . the body cradle is nicely padded but isn t firmly seated inside the center tube and even though it has a rudimentary locking design it just isn t all that solid . you can adjust the height but just inserting the top piece into the bottom caused deep scratches in the black paint of the top tube piece . it ships with an unsightly white upc sticker which must be tediously removed if you want it to look good onstage .granted the sheraton ii is a large and heavy guitar but the onstage is billed as heavy duty and to me that means solid which this stand just isn t at least with larger guitars or basses . when you use a guitar stand you can t afford to be dealing with something that is in the least bit temperamental or you risk damaging your instrument and possibly even your livelihood .bottom line you get what you pay for . for smaller lighter guitars strats and such it may be ok but for dots sheratons s and larger gretch s i just wouldn t trust it and that goes for most basses as well .i will need to look for something else .
nice bright white cardstock not too heavy for making folded card projects . exactly as described and folds cleanly for a single fold . not recommended for a multiple fold project .i love my magna carta . i used my cart for moving my mom and it was a real work horse . it may be light weight and appear small but it is sturdy and durable folds down flat and stores easily . i keep it in the trunk of my car and pull it out for all sorts of chores .i was able to put together one of the four boxes in this pack within minutes just pop out fold over the sides just a bit and there you have your box ! it is very sturdy yet easy to carry though that will change as you add and add and add contents . the handles fold over so they are double thickness as is the bottom of the box . the paper is very easy to write on or to place stickers on whichever method you prefer to use .however this is supposed to have a string and button means of closer and it doesn t it has a fold down lid that fits snuggly on it . while that works great for me it isn t what the product is supposed to be . did they send me the wrong one ?
we had our car seat checked at the local police station and the safety officer recommended that we not use anything under our car seat . in case of an accident or a problem with the car seat using any additional product such as this mat or an attached fleece covering may void the warranty of your car seat !i really like it however afterwards i have learnt that this is not an approved or tested product and that it should not be used as it interferes with the car seat s performance in case of an accident .this car seat base does not work with graco snugride seats . just make sure you order the correct one .
it works but cheaply madeyou need to look at each package you buy and make sure you know where it was made . not all nylabone products are made in the us .these are one of the most popular treats we ever purchased . i like that this product is american made . the pieces are lightweight cubes and odor free .
been using it for a few years now . the deal here on amazon is a great price . a bottle half this size is only a dollar and change less in my favorite store . both the quality and price are outstanding but you knew that .love the price on these and they do what they are support do i guess . .but the price is great ! ! ! ! ! ! these filters are missized and sometimes pretty ineffective however for the price you can not beat the product and price
i use it every year to maintain the charge on the lawn tractor batteries . doesn t take too long and the indicator lights make it easy to know when the battery is fully charged .this is a great little charger unit . it is not actually a battery maintainer like some of the real expensive units out there . i have a batteryminder unit which is a real maintainer but at times the cost too ! this will charge a battery and will float the charge at a very low rate of charge input to maintain the full charge level . for the money it costs this is a very nice little unit . if you are using it on a large car or truck battery this will maintain the charge but is a bit small to attempt to charge a low or dead battery if it is a large one . for small batteries and such this will charge them just fine . i use it to maintain a motorcycle battery with no problem . schumacher is an excellent long time company and with amazon s guarantee you won t go wrong . enjoy !i see a lot of negative reviews for this charger that i think are partially due to amazon s incorrect description and the fact that most people don t know what size or type of charger they need . including myself i am a practicing electronic engineer with more than yrs experience . i did not know much about battery chargers until recently researching what a good battery charger should do . this charger only delivers a max of . a . this means if you try to charge a discharged auto battery ah it will take a long long time . this charger does work great for topping off a car battery at . v . the instructions included clearly state the charger will automatically shut off after hours of charging . the charger will restart and continue charging if you unplug and then plug the charger in again . best to get a higher capacity charger . this charger does have a float mode sort of . actually it shuts off the charging current and monitors battery voltage . when the battery voltage drops low enough the charger cycles on to top it off and then shuts off again .my summary st i like this charger and think it does a good job for the price . gold box special was . tax . i would definitely buy it at the regular price for it s basically automatic . don t have to set the voltage and it won t damage anything if you reverse the clips accidently . compact size and reasonable quality clamps .this charger does what it is designed for . that is charge small batteries and top off larger automotive batteries . this is an excellent maintenance charger for all batteries to keep them fully charged when not in use . my opinion personally i would not leave any charger connected to my battery for more than hours . now i use a cheap mechanical timer that is set to turn on for hour every hours . i would prefer a timer that i can set to turn on twice a week for a few hours .the charger is small feels solidly built with heavy plastic . it gets very warm aftercharging at . a but not warm enough to be concerned . no cooling fan i gave this charger stars because price and performance is very good . build quality is good as well .amazon description poor is incorrect in that this charger is not intended to be used to charge a low discharged car battery . the chart in the description that shows the charging times is different than the manual . . the included manual has a chart that states this charger should only be used as a top off or maintenance charger for auto batteries . in addition the charger in charging mode automatically shuts off after hours of charging . a good safety feature in my opinion . charging details i discharged a car truck jump start battery pack to . v or approx charge . typical full charge is . v to . v . to discharge the battery i used a battery alternator tester . i have a voltmeter attached to charger and a current meter in series with battery and battery charger negative terminal . at the start of the charge the charge current was . a and then jumped to . a in a few minutes .

charger ac power is w measured with a belkin watt meter .almost hours seems like a long time to charge a battery and this isn t even a full capacity car battery . but it did a good job of gently charging the battery especially when it was near full charge . the important thing to me is the charging current declined as the battery neared full charge . this prevents overcharging and truly tops off the battery to maximum capacity .i tested the battery the next day with a battery tester and it passed well within the good battery full charge limits . the results were much better than the charger that came with the battery pack where it tested near weak .very happy with the purchase . i would buy this exact model again . should there be any problem s in the future i will update this review .ships from and sold by amazon .
easy to use easy to install and it has so many different options of installation extensions y spindles stairway adaptors and all were easy to figure out . even my plus mother said it was easy to figure out how to use it without any instruction . really liked how the bottom supports that press against the wall were flat on the bottom edge so they lay against the floor better . my other brand of gate didnt have that . only complaint was my box had no directions in it . but managed without them .but in spite of some of the obvious flaws as mentioned in detail by other reviewers this stool has actually been perfect for us . we purchased the white one with the black top over years ago . it still looks great will last until the grand kids at the rate it is holding up . it seems indestructible .some reviewers complained that it tips if a child steps too close to the edge . there s a trade off here if you build a perfectly stable stool with a wide base then another safety scenario is created the base becomes a tripping hazard .there are hazards in life . nothing is perfectly safe . we taught our kids to step in the middle of the stool demonstrated what would happen if they ignored our instructions . with these instruction the stool has worked like a charm .this kidco configure gate is worth every penny if you need to enclose and odd shaped space ! we needed to block off a hallway in our basement but had uneven walls and this gate works perfectly . the installation was a little bit involved since you have to screw the brackets into studs in the walls but it only took about minutes and we had it up .some tips for installing the gate . first read through the entire instruction manual before you start . the way the manual is structured there are instructions in several languages in the front and then reference pictures in the back . if you read through the manual and flip back and forth until you understand the pictures before you start it makes the installation go pretty smoothly . . try to mount the brackets to studs in your walls . since you can configure the gate to any length angle by changing the angle of each joint try to configure it so that you can mount each bracket to a stud in the wall so you don t have to worry about energetic kids pulling them out . . try to configure the gate so that each joint is at least at a degree angle . if you put them straight across the gate will flex a little bit . it doesn t really affect the stability of the gate since it is anchored to the walls but the flexing will go away if you angle each sectionoverall this gate worked for enclosing our odd shaped space perfectly and i would highly recommend it !
a solidly constructed box that is stackable as long as it is completely filled and easy to carry . it is the top that is the one problem . since the box quite long in relation to its width the middle part of the top opening is a point of structural weakness this is compounded by the fact that the two folding lids do not completely cross over the top of the box and have only a overlap . if something heavy and not as wide as the box is set on top the lid will bend inwards and open .because of this while these boxes have securable lids the cords on the ends are very secure they are not all that secure . a lidded bankers box with a string and button fastener on each end would be preferable . in addition since the box is a flap top it is harder to access files than in a box with a removable lid making these boxes really only useful for storing archival files .way back in the early s these were called r kive boxes . these are very similar . they arrive flat and you unfold them and assemble them . you assemble the lids and the boxes separately . no glue or anything like that needed just fold in the flaps and push down in the bottom of the box to force together the cardboard flaps .these are not waterproof . when folded together there are gaps at each of the bottom corners of the box .the flaps that fold down inside the box are prone to getting papers or folders caught under them when lifting items out . i put some clear packing tape over them to attach them to the inside of the box and remove the chance things will catch on them .the lids stay together just fine as do the boxes . legal size folders length wise regular size folder width wise . they are smaller than a standard file cabinet drawer but that makes them easier to handle and pick up when full .i really like that these have a double bottom and they fold open so there is no assembly required .the lids do need to be folded to shape . they fit securely and the tabs fit into the box handles so they lock in and when opening one end the other tab acts as a hinge .if you want to use hanging file folders in the box the lid does not fit as well and you would need to tape them closed . the price of a pack is more than if you were to pick them up at a local office supply but the pack is a good value .in previous years many reviewers complained about the smell of these boxes but the manufacturer must have fixed that problem because they have no odor .
i needed a small wastebasket for under my desk and this one fits perfectly plus it s not plastic . i can trash things as needed instead of letting it pile up on my desk . reasonably priced too . fuzzy wuzzy s summary highly recommended with warm fuzzies !packaging style appearance excellent fuzzies ratingconstruction build quality excellent fuzzies ratingcompetitive pricing value average not good not bad fuzzies rating positives high build quality with good welds and smooth semi gloss black enamel coating . strong steel tubular legs can support up to pounds . if you use this as a laptop riser stand by placing a laptop on the top shelf the surface is perforated with many holes to allow for great air circulation and heat dissipation . negatives there are no negatives with this product this is an excellent solidly built steel stand that both looks attractive with its uniform semi gloss black enamel coating and can support a large computer display monitor or any other item weighing up to pounds . you can either place this on your desk or on a table or countertop e .g . some people have a computer in their kitchen to organize your computer laptop keyboard display layout better .this monitor stand weighs . pounds and has outer dimensions of . width x . depth x . height . the top shelf has surface dimensions of . width x . depth . the space underneath the shelf is . wide which is the . outer width minus the width of the two tubular legs . the space underneath the shelf has a usable height of . which is the . outer height minus the height of the tubular metal that supports the top shelf .even though this is advertised as a monitor stand i am using this as a laptop stand placing a inch laptop on top of the shelf . my computer desk already has a raised shelf where my two display monitors are positioned and my desk has an adjustable keyboard tray where my keyboard and mouse reside . i have multiple desktop and laptop computers so sometimes i place one laptop underneath this stand s shelf with its lid closed and a vga cable connecting that laptop to a larger monitor and another inch laptop sits on the top shelf of this stand . when placing a laptop on this stand where i use a separate bluetooth keyboard instead of the laptop s own keyboard the stand s perforated metal surface functions like a ventilated platform to help cool the laptop . since many laptops have their fan intake vents located underneath the laptop it is advantageous that this stand s shelf surface is a perforated metal grill to allow for great air circulation all along the bottom of the laptop . most of the other laptop riser stands are either made of flimsy plastic or metal mesh that is too thin with too much flex in the structure .but regardless of whether you need to place a large display monitor a large laptop or other item this stand serves as a simple sturdy and modern looking support .i love this desk organizer . i like the fact that it has spaces both vertically and horizontally and since they are combined it takes up less space on the desk .
notice in the name guitar input . this is not to be confused with the amplitube irig which achieves input and output through the ipad ios devices headphone jack . headphone connections can be noisy and have reliable connection problems . they also depend on the built in ad da converters in the ipad ios device . this apogee jam k is a professional quality input device that has dedicated a d analogue to digital converter but depends on the built in hardware of the ipad ios device for playback . on the other hand apogee one has both ad and da convertors for both input and output .amplitube irig from ik multimedia has a simple stereo headphone in and out jack plug that plugs into your ipad . the built in hardware in the ipad is something that i love for doing something like watching a movie cozying up to the inch screen but for audio phile quality you need a dedicated a dedicated pre and ad convertor and that is what this apogee jam k has . mind you it has that for audio recording input but playback is handled via your headphone jack on your ipad . you can of course just use that for monitoring your mix and then save the file in a digital format internally and send to a playback device with pristine digital audio quality e .g . saving as a .wav file . this makes the apogee k jam a very usable device to achieve high quality recordings at a very nice price .so here it the continuum . amplitube irig for headphone jack input and output quality built into your ipad etc . the apogee jam k for digital quality conversion on input only with playback being handled by headphone jack on ipad . the apogee one on the other hand at roughly times the price gives you both ad da conversions so it has its own audio output jack plus tracks of recording either instrument and or a balanced external microphone jack . it also comes with a built in condenser mic that is pretty amazing . it also has volt phantom power for using your favorite condenser mic . when you get into the apogee duet and quartet you get more connections plus the all too important option of midi connectivity .this tascam us usb audio interface is exactly what i was looking for to record from our wireless mic with xlr outputs directly to my pc video editing software . we professionally produce instructional videos and needed this for voice over work on existing footage . before getting this convenient little unit we had to record into a camcorder and then import it into the pc so this saves us a step when we only need to record audio . here are my observations plug and play connected to my pc via usb and was instantly recognized usb powered no external power needed a big plus when using my laptop good sound clean and clear input multiple inputs xlr mic rca stereo line and hi z guitarmisc xlr input is not powered not a problem for us includes audacity software but we did not need to load ithighly recommended !cfhi primarily use this as an usb adapter for my headphones so that i can connect convert the . mm headphone jack into my pc .the audio adapter is well built . it has a yellow led light that is solid when plugged into an usb port and blinks when there is a device that is connected to it through a . mm jack .installation was flawless . windows bit installed drivers immediately .no issues . no nonsense . simply works !
i purchased the black medium large to go in my pitbull puppy s midwest crate http www .amazon .com gp product b at m ref oss product .it fits perfectly and it is a great pet bed for a crate especially since the crate is her place i am teaching her the place command !my puppy loves it already ! i immediately put it in there it fit perfectly under the divider for her crate too and she was in there sniffing and laying on it .now i can t wait for her to learn to stay in her place . she s doing great though !i ordered this online because it is cheaper than at petco or pestmart but i would suggest going into one of those stores before hand to check out the sizes . i decided to order the large because i have a golden and liked the ft option but when this leash arrived today i was shocked about how big and heavy this was . we were using the bags on board brand retractable leash ft and although this leash doesnt hold bags i liked the idea of the tape vs the cord from our previously leash . under product dimensions it does say but i suppose i didnt expect it to be so giant no way it would be comfortable to hold . needless to say i returned the giant size and went to local petco and bought the medium large ft with tape which is a much better size . luckily amazon is great with returns thus far .this is not a dog bed . there isn t any cushion to this item . it is a dog mat . it does have a water proof backing and a chenille type material on top . i thought i was buying a bed but what i got was a cage mat to lay on the bottom of my dogs crate . if you are looking for a bed don t buy this item . i gave it three stars because the quality is good but the item description is deceiving . i purchased this item back in it is november of and i am adding information to my review because of negative comments i have received which make it seem as if i could not read or did not pay attention to the product title when i purchased this item .back in i purchased here is the exact title of the description that i copied from my amazon order listed under my account a precision pet snoozzy sleeper bed medium large x black pet supplies as you can see years ago it was listed as a pet bed not a mat . i am glad the manufacturer changed the item description because it is indeed a mat not a bed which is why i gave it three stars instead of . if i knew it was a mat at the time i was looking to purchase a pet bed i would not have bought it because i was not looking for a mat . with that said the quality of this mat is very good . so if you are looking for a mat i would definitely get this mat for your pet . i guess my review caused the manufacturer to change the name of the product which is good for all of you looking to purchase either a mat or bed for your pet . at least you won t get something you weren t looking to buy which is what happened to me back in .
works as advertised . the labels do warp a bit with age but this does not affect how they print or attach .does what it does and has what it said .works good so far .buy it when you can have compatible staplersit s doesn t fray nor is it hard to pull off . it s a bit pricey but otherwise it does the job . quality is there .
this works well to keep a baby busy . it s just too bad you can t change the battery . the battery hasn t run out yet though . i did buy this previously for another baby and i don t recall the battery running out for a long time .i really like how this product hid the plugs and kept my son from unplugging plugging the electronics . it is very hard however for me to open it but i guess that s the point .i love the vibration feature . . . thats why i picked this one . i have to do the yard work while my husband is away with the military and i can even mow the lawn and know when she wakes up . so far i haven t had a problem . . . twice i have had to replace the batteries in the mobile portion . the monitor seems to fade you have to keep turning the volume up to hear and then it fuzzes that s when the batteries need to be replaced . i hope that this is the only problem that i will have with it i really like this one . also i have had no interference or problem getting out of range while working in the yard .
i use it everyday primarily for a storage cover . i have not had the cover on the bike in rain or weather . i got the xl for my cbr r with full large rear bags and windshield . i can lock my helmet to the rear seat area put the cover on and it will cover up the entire bikes exhaust and of the rear tire and entire front tire . two bungies mid bike and front tire enable hokking cover under bike . very sturdy and breathable with exhaust panels silver durable material and inner windshield liner . much bang for the buck . would certainly purchase another if i had to without question .i use this on the back window of my jeep grand cherokee . it does not flex enough to have full contact on the window . it only has about of contact . i will not purchase this again .used this to pull the rear axles in my jeep grand cherokee laredo x due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak . works great . would recommend .
great size for someone with a smaller dog and perhaps a smaller stature . i wouldn t recommend this amended size for a tall person .these are the perfect size for training smaller dogs . but both my labrador and my mini dachshund love these treats .my lbs lab mix loved this bone ! perfect size for him to chew on . definitely would recommend this to others !
i have previously used in honda cx c to fix a rough idle suzuki sv to stabilize fuel and a chevy cobalt to fix a problem with stalling at idle .perfect for exhaust work . i bought it for a catalytic converter and o sensor project because it is rated for f to fthis fit all four o sensors on my toyota tundra and i could have not completed the job without this specialized socket .
if you have a vehicle like i do that turns off the cigarette lighter circuit when you remove the key then this meter is limited in its usefulness . sure you can see what s cooking just by inserting the meter and turning on the ignition without starting the car . but suppose you want to continuously monitor the battery while it s being trickle charged over a few days and you have removed the keys . can t do . still the unit is well made accurate i checked it against a high quality vom and easy to read .seems well made and works as it should . like the fact it has the led s which is a quick and easy way to see if your vehicles wiring is working as it should and can point you in the right direction if you may be having an issue with your trailers lightsoh and the display can t be read in bright sunlight . that s the first thing i noticed when trying to use it actually . i didn t know it was even on and working until i cupped my hands around the display to see that indeed my battery s voltage was in fact displayed . very dimly . a better screen type would have been a great idea in a garage this likely wouldn t be an issue .this unit does two types of tests one with the car off which tests the battery s voltage and somehow its cranking capacity . my van s cca battery came in at and got the green led . all good there . it seems well built and the clamps permanently attached are decent . make sure you get a good connection to the battery posts or the cca reading will be inaccurately low i had to adjust a few times to get it right .for part two the charging system test you kind of need a second person to do properly . one standing at the battery to watch the readout and control the test and a nd person in the driver s seat to start the car then keep it revved to rpms and then turn on the vehicle s loads hi beam headlights full power fan rear defroster recommended for the load test . at each step you press a button or two on the device to move it forward and it doesn t store the voltage so running back and forth from device to vehicle controls isn t ideal .the tester works well once you figure out how to navigate the device s menu and learn what the odd letter contractions mean for various parts tests this thing can run there s a cheat sheet on the back of the device . there had to be a more straightforward way to run through the steps though .anyway it s a handy device and tells me more about the battery than just my multimeter did . . . but not that much more just the current cca cranking capability of the battery . if that extra bit of info is worth the cost of the device to you then by all means get this tester . if you re okay just knowing voltage and already have a multimeter it tells you almost as much info as this device does is far more all purpose and you can get one that will work fine for under ten bucks harbor freight etc .
i have the nipples given to us in the hospital and they are slow flow . these nipples allow milk to flow out when the bottle is upside down unlike the other slow flows i have .finding the right playtex nipples has been like a goldilocks and the three bears experience for me . the latex playtex slow flow naturalatch nipples that we got with our bottles were way too fast . my nearly month old baby chokes because the milk flows so fast . when super hungry he can chug a oz bottle in minutes with the slow flow latex version . so i tried these silicone naturalatch slow flows and they are way too slow . my baby gets frustrated with how slow these nipples flow . it took him up to an hour sometimes to finish a oz bottle ! there needs to be some middle ground . since these slow flow silicone nipples were too slow i tried the medium flow version and it was way too fast .strangely enough i found that the playtex orthodontic latex medium flow is the perfect flow speed but the flat shape of the nipple neck base makes it difficult to funnel the last of the milk into the nipple . the flat nipple makes it difficult for my baby to get those last drops even if i could funnel the last of the milk into it . ultimately there s always wasted milk with this nipple . playtex needs to work on improving their nipple flows .highly recommend these nipple shields for protection of your nipple but also for babies that are between the breast and bottle feeding . it s clears the nipple confusion instantly .
it s an aftermarket replacement idler pulley . it fits and works but i give it the extra star since it is a metal pulley instead of plastic oem .fits my john deere lawn tractor which is model la and likely it fits all the l la and d series lower end john deere tractors . please post a comment if it does not and i ll update this reviewcurrently amazon says it does not fit my third generation miata nc but it doesthese filters come top in most online filter tests and i use them in almost all my carsvery good and loud i replaced my original horn on my yamaha v star classic with this horn used same bracket and just plugged it into factory horn wires .now it sounds more like a truck instead of a vw bug .people notice this horn !great price too .
i received this thermometer as a shower gift . after reading the reviews posted here i decided to find out if mine was accurate . i tested it on myself against my other digital thermometer finding of a degree difference orally then against my braun thermoscan plus finding of a degree difference orally vs . ear . as my other digital is very old i don t know if the degree difference was from quality or age . while the difference with the braun may seem alarming it is actually quite normal . body temps read differently when taken axillary orally rectally and by thermoscan . there can actually be as much as one degree difference in the readings with axillary and oral reading lower than rectal and thermoscan . read your product info cards take a few readings and realize that thermometers do not read the same temp from different body locations . i am keeping my safety st thermometer . it s accurate and extremely affordable ! i will not use my braun on my infant until she s much older nearly all pediatricians want a rectal temperature anyway .on the first use of this item a sliver of metal fell off . if i was not in a well lit room and paying close attention my week old could have gotten seriously hurt . to add salt to the wound i tried to return the item and i got two separate emails from the seller . the first email asked me to describe the defect . i responded to the email . after which i received a second email asking me to send a picture of the item seriously ! . do you think i am storing the sliver of metal to take a picture of it ? . if i described the defect as a sliver of metal the product would look the same as in the original picture of the item as a sliver denotes a very small piece so the seller already has a picture of what the product looks like . . if the seller needed a picture this should have been requested in the first email not in a second email . i shop online because i have limited time . i do not have time to respond to an email trail for a nail clip . however i am so irritated with the product and the seller s response that i decided to write this review . in addition my request to return the item was closed before the return approval process was completed !even after reading the negative reviews here of mirrors that fogged up and were uncleanable i decided to order one and try my luck . sure enough as soon as i opened the package i discovered a mirror that was so cloudy i couldn t even see my reflection .i called the manufacturer blue ridge international products in freeport fl and they told me there was a bad batch of mirrors produced but they ve found and fixed the problem and they d be happy to send me a replacement at no charge .they took my name address and phone number and said i should have it within days . if you run into the same problem i encourage you to call the company and request a replacement be proactive ! stars terrible product initially received which was an inconvenience but manufacturer s customer service was cheerful prompt and obliging .
i can t believe how difficult it is to find tie downs that have locking hooks . there are none out there except for these . they re heavy duty and meet the need perfectlyi probably should compare it to another to see how accurate it is but i really like how easy it is to use and turns off and on by itself .this product works well . however as some others have said a bolt to hold the thing on the jack isn t really needed and is rather cumbersome to remove and install . a quick pin would have been better . do you hear that hi lift ?
bought this for the local animal shelter that is strictly volunteers . they don t know me and i like it that way . happy to do for the fur babies i can not bring home .i have never seen a can of fish food that size before . amazing ! ! i won t need another can for a long while . when i reorder i will be sure to order this one .comfortable in my hand and triples how far i can throw . i think i can make it go a good yards . we love it !
my issue with the pedaltrain is the accommodation of a power supply . i have a voodoo lab pedal power plus .the documentation that comes with this pedalboard specifically states that this power supply mounts under the board and it even includes mounting brackets that fit this power supply . however if you actually try to mount it to the underside of the board as suggested you re in for an unpleasant surprise .first of all regarding the two circular holes on the front of the board . the fitment to the power supply is there . . . sort of . there s no way to align them perfectly because the holes on the pedaltrain are slightly too close together . i wasn t worried about this since i doubt i ll ever chain them and only have access to outlet .the second issue is the allegedly self tapping screws that come with the mounting kit strip as though they were made of butter . once you ve got them in or attempted to do so they re never coming out . you ll probably have to break them . it s a shame to have cut corners on something so inexpensive .the main issue i have with this board relating to my voodoo lab power supply is this . once you get the power supply mounted properly on the underside of the board it can only go one place you begin to plug in your pedals and you discover that the cables supplied with the power supply don t fit the mounting location on this board . you can t plug them in because there s not enough clearance between the frame of the pedalboard and the sockets the cables plug in to .i really only bought this pedalboard because of the supposed perfect compatibility with the voodoo lab power supply i own but given that it doesn t fit like it s supposed to i wish i could return this board except i can t because it now has holes drilled in it . you have to drill the board to mount the power supply underneath it . basically i paid for a plain flat sheet metal metal rectangle and a couple rolls of velcro . needless to say i m not very pleased .too much noise with one spot . this was way better .lot of feature .outlets can all be used to power either v or v pedals . for each outlet just use the voltage selector switches to choose the voltage you need plug in your pedal and go !outlet works the same way and gives you a similar choice except that it s between v and v .outlets and may only be used one at a time . if you use them both at the same time you might get some noise . like outlets outlet gives you a choice between v and v . outlet is a v ac outlet for pedals that require ac power . isolated outputs delivering ma each centre pin is negative ac output at connector . will power all pedals .most of my pedals are to ma . so potentially i could have plus pedals in a chain . awesomeall the cables you needlike all t rex fuel tank power supplies your new chameleon comes with a full set of cables to help you keep your board clutter free . once you ve selected your voltage options just plug in and play !excellent !don t even think about it .just get it .highly recommend itthe pedal works as described . the draw back is the battery installation . you have to take the pedal off to access the battery . the other thing is if you forget to unplug the input cord from your guitar the battery drains when not in use . i purchased a power supply to go along with it . the problem with that is the power supply is one more thing to find a plug in for . it s ok for the money and works good . i run it wide open and have the amp gain pretty high also to get the retro sound i am looking for . i mainly use it with a large body f hole guitar with a set of very heavy flat wound strings . the lows with vibrate the fillings out of your teeth !
i am running an aquaclear on a gallon heavily planted tank . the filter is very very quiet . it does not give the kind of water cleaning and polishing that a canister filter would give but for the price its a nice choice . i have used this line of aquaclear filters on nearly a dozen different freshwater tanks for the last decade . . . they are my favorite hang on back filters .this is the first time i have not upgraded a filter in other words normally i would have gotten an aquaclear or for a gallon aquarium but for this tank i just wanted some water circulation . the tank is very lightly stocked and the plants do most of the filtering . if you are setting up a standard tank i would recommend upgrading the filter so you have nearly double the filter capacity on your tank . ie so you have a filter for a gallon tank on a gallon tank a filter for a gallon tank on a gallon tank etc . it makes for healthier fish and less maintenance .i have a prefilter pre filter sponge pack for fluval edge aquarium on the aquaclear to keep the cherry shrimp and fry from getting sucked up into the filter . the prefilter fits on the uptake tube perfectly and is working as it should .i recently ran an aquaclear and an aquaclear on a gallon tank . both of those filters were much louder than this little aquaclear . i m guessing that the more powerful the motor is the louder the filter is . i did try the trick of swabbing silicon grease on the impeller shaft and both of those two larger filters were still too loud for me . i am now running a canister filter on that tank and am very happy with it .i ve also tried the updated version of the aquaclear line thefluval c power filter . i did not like that filter as much as the old aquaclears . the fluval was not any quieter and there was so much hardware in the filter box that it really forced you to use only their filter media . one of the great things about the aquaclears is that you can put in just about anything you want in the filter box like peat moss or ammorocks or whatever your heart desires . i like that flexibility .as much as i like the aquaclears though i leave them behind for canister filters when the tank is any more than gallons . hang on back filters are ok but for a big tank or for any tank that needs top notch water quality give me a canister filter .i had two tetra gallon rating and wanted to get a stronger one . got this and this one is weaker than the ! the outperformed this rated gallons ! on the and gallon tank ! so i now have two tetra powering a gang valve supplying airlines total to a and gallon tank . the is left to work on the gallon tank !save money and get the tetra instead !i bought this to use on my gallon breeder tank . it is very handy and informative . i recommend for fish tank owners
i ve read some complaints about this unit . maybe those folksshould shell out an additional for something better .to the rest of you with the storage units this is a great tool .my band i to be exact uses this to store backing tracks for songswe play . for instance one of our songs has a difficult drum track .i just loaded the whole pre recorded track into a slot .or one of our songs has a train whistle in the background . i loadedthe effect into a slot .or another song we do needs birds tweeting and children laughingand playing in the background . i recorded the track and loaded it intoa slot .basically any instrument or sound effect accompaniment you need butdon t have someone else to play it you can play it back using this device .this tascam us usb audio interface is exactly what i was looking for to record from our wireless mic with xlr outputs directly to my pc video editing software . we professionally produce instructional videos and needed this for voice over work on existing footage . before getting this convenient little unit we had to record into a camcorder and then import it into the pc so this saves us a step when we only need to record audio . here are my observations plug and play connected to my pc via usb and was instantly recognized usb powered no external power needed a big plus when using my laptop good sound clean and clear input multiple inputs xlr mic rca stereo line and hi z guitarmisc xlr input is not powered not a problem for us includes audacity software but we did not need to load ithighly recommended !cfhthe us works fine for my needs rough and ready audio tracking with bit cubase on bit windows . my pc is for general use with a non studio configuration no mixer non phantom power mics headphone monitoring .if you re buying for a studio setup requiring phantom power or multiple inputs you ll need a separate mixer and or standalone phantom supply . from the mixer you can cable to the us s line input via rca jacks on the back .there were a couple of hiccups during setup but i don t blame the device . it uses stock o s drivers that loaded right up . the documentation is minimal and only covers up to vista but it s accurate and you ll manage with win . on the windows side make the usb audiocodec your default recording and playback device to override any onboard or card based audio and speakers i have realtek onboard and . desktop speakers .i m using asio all with cubase and cubase crashed a couple of times while configuring vst connections and i o busses . once configured however it s been solid .i d recommend checking out user forums for your particular software platform to find similar gotchas and to set your expectations .on an xp machine changing the default sound devices often means the hassle of toggling settings before and after launching the daw . on win once i unplug the us the settings revert nicely to my desktop speakers . if i plug the us back in the settings revert again very reliable . even better if i want to use cubase strictly for midi the software detects the change and i don t have to reconfigure connections or busses . that may be a function of cubase so again it pays to research your particular software .while the us is connected you ll hear nothing from your computer speakers and have to rely upon the us s headphone jack or audio out rca jacks . this is where the balance control is very helpful . it s not a pan it s a center position gain mixing the computer s output from within your daw as well as outside system sounds with direct monitoring of your input signal . very simple to use for overdubbing . some people may prefer a hard left right pan while overdubbing i can live with the center mix though a switch to toggle a true pan would have been a terrific feature .if you do want desktop speaker playback after your tracks are done there are a number ways to go unplug the us and restart your daw . run a cable from the rca outs on the us to the mini jack aux in on your desktop speakers run a mini jack extension cord from the headphone jack on the us to the aux in .while using the headphone jack the rca audio outs are muted and vis versa . rather than having to pull out the headphone i would prefer a push switch that toggles the front to back output but i can live without it .again the us works great so long as your needs meet its capabilities . you can t rely on the product description or packaging to answer that . fortunately there s enough user information out there for just about any setup it shouldn t be difficult to track down .
not sure why most bulbs are sold in single packages but these light bulbs fit my gallon aquarium hood perfectly .this bulb provides uva and uvb which is crucial for bearded dragons and other reptiles . we ve had two that both lasted almost exactly months . i am purchasing a third .i suspect that some people do not have a properly ventilated fixture . you must have a deep fixture with a ceramic socket and plenty of ventilation around the base . i use azoo med deep dome lamp fixture black which sets on top of the screen cover but still keeps the bulb away from the screen .please read the instructions about how far to position the bulb from your reptile . if you put any uv bulb this one or the competition too close it can burn their eyes and skin .this inch airstone is perfect for my gallon aquarium !
this is wide ruled paper and is easier for grades to form their words on .there are sheets of paper in a pack with drilled holes and fit perfectly in a inch binder .this is paper . it is made from trees which are turned to pulp and then turned into this nice wide lined not scratchy smooth paper . i m a bigger fan of narrow ruled paper . my kid likes college ruled paper but the wide lines are better for those who have to write a one page hand written report when they don t have a lot to say .this college rules graph paper is filler paper meaning it can be inserted into a three ring binder . each sheet has a reinforced strip on it to prevent it ripping out of the binder . the thickness of the paper is adequate and as i expected . the lines on the paper are perfectly consistent throughout the package and they are dark enough . this graph paper is double sided and has different size graph lines on the front and back . on the front one square inch of paper contains squares and on the back one square inch of paper contains squares on it . overall the price is a little high for only sheets but you get both sides of the paper so it s like getting sheets of cheaper single side graph paper . this is very good paper and we like it a lot .
disclosure i am not basing my review on first hand experience but the way it is i could trust that this guy works . when car is upside down this keychain would stay in place in the ignition ring and you could quickly find it and pull it . breaks glass with tries but not wind shield . practice in the junkyard and you ll see and the quickest way to cut the seatbelt . m knows how to make sandpaper . when you get to grit you re really polishing . i use this prior to polishing something .works perfectly on a honda prelude . replaced the rotor as the same time as the distributor cap and wires and plugs . might as well since you are in there and it is so cheap .the trick to getting it off is that the one screw that holds it in is only accessible when the engine cylinders are in a specific location . i found it easiest to disconnect all the spark plugs so it wouldn t actually start then crank the car momentarily . after you crank go and check if the screw is there . if not crank again check again . took me about tries but it is really random . the precise way of doing it is to turn it by hand or to put in gear and roll it slowly but i found it much easier to just crank and try .
buying an extra base is so much cheaper and easier than having two car seats . it is exactly the same as the base that came with my car seat .grandma was not ready to give up leather seating in her car and wanted something to protect the leather from damage when a booster seat was installed . the prince lionheart two stage seat saver seemed to be what i was looking for . not only was it somewhat more rigid than other seat protectors but it came in tan so that it matched my car s interior . additionally since i live in south texas the lighter color is more desirable for purposes of keeping the vehicle s interior from getting so hot . there should be no issue with the seat saver staining the lighter leather black as based on reviewers comments some other brands do .the prince lionheart two stage seat saver was easy to install . the base filled one of the back bucket seats the seat saver s back needed to have been about longer to completely protect the booster seat back from coming in contact with the vehicle s seat . further it would have been helpful if each side of the prince lionheart two stage seat saver had tabs that extended over the seat back . that would have prevented the booster seat straps from digging into the vehicle s seat when the booster seat was correctly installed . because of the vehicle s seat depth the prince lionheart two stage seat saver s front flap does not bend at the marked area but still provides a bit of protection to the seat edge . having a little one who likes to drum his feet makes me appreciate this feature i do wish the flap had been a bit longer and had multiple grooves for bending .there was no sliding of the britax frontier sict booster seat which was installed on this seat saver the booster seat held firmly in place . the backing on the prince lionheart two stage seat saver is a rubber like mesh similar to the material used to keep floor rugs from sliding . since i have not yet had the seat in place during one of our very hot texas summers i do not know whether there will be a sticking problem . i will probably remove the booster seat during the summer unless our little one is visiting so that i can avoid this potential problem .i would have rated the prince lionheart two stage seat saver a . if that rating had been available . with the exception of the suggested changes i am very pleased with this product .we are very satisfied with this car seat . we have car seats by this brand name . all have worked well . no complaints .
purchase this as my second bark collar for one of my mini long hair doxies . i have to put it on pretty tight this little guy keeps barking but has managed to figure out if his bark is higher pitched he won t get zapped . the other dog doesn t want to tempt it . it does work well though .this is pretty good and easy to program .the only problem is it sometimes does not rotate all the way to the next bowl . i will be keeping an eye on that to see how it goes .this is awesome for a walk in the park . if your dog is running too far away from you you can press the brake button and the leash stops running even though it has the capacity to run up to feet . it gives you control while your dog is free to walk further than your average annoying small leash . just make sure you snap it correctly onto your dog s harness or collar . if you don t the leash could snap back at you and injure you . check the safety instructions and you will be fine . i recommend it . 
i had been buying my tubing at walmart . it is cheaper there than this is but it is too small and stiff . this tubing is easier to slide onto the air nozzles and is more flexible . this is the only tubing i will use now .this is a soft easy to use tubing from elite . the silicone airline slides easily onto nipples of the pump and fittings . this tubing for aquariums will be used for a bait well and should hold up and provide me with feet of blue tubing for my airlines . nice product better than the other tubing i have used . i like it .i use diamond blend on both my tanks and it keeps them crystal clear . i do add a little extrablack diamond premium activated carbon oz . g to get a better ratio and it does the job . imo it s better and cheaper than buying the pre made filter inserts .
this item should of been plastic not cloth .when put to dry mold grows . even if u wash it the mold doesnt go away .it also annoyingly soaks all the water .i wont recommend .i really like this bath pad . my little guy nestles nicely into it and i don t have to worry about him sliding around on it . it s also nice because i can spray it with warm water before i put him on it and it will retain the warmth so it s not a cold shocker on him . has a nice plastic hanger on the top that is great for hanging it on the shower curtain rod to dry . you really do have to be diligent about drying it and letting all of the surfaces to be exposed to air otherwise it will mold but it can be thrown in the washing machine too .this toddler tub accomplishes with ease what it was designed to do bathe your baby . the insertable fabric sling accommodates new ones while the base tub handles toddlers as they quickly grow bigger . softer skid resistant surfaces inside the tub keep the baby from slipping and where you want him . slots in the base keep the tub safely in place across a sink or you can sit it in the bottom of an adult bathtub folded towel for old knees recommended . conveniently emptied from a drain hole when finished it s easily dried and stored in a closet . a great solution to an age old chore .
how can one really rate it as it is used for protection and no idae how long it should last yet is was as listed so i give it the benifit ogf the doubt . . .rated the best value filter on the market by independent testers that tested each filter on the market by using them and then cutting the filters open to see how they held up under actual use . they then rated the filters on how well they fared and also how well they were made .i don t know how many of you remember the definitions of accuracy and precision from high school chemistry but this product is both ! i compared it to two other inaccurate tire gauges and this one was the only consistently accurate gauge after comparing at the dealership . highly recommended considering its price and durability .
we love these spoons ! they are a great toddler size you can actually get a few cheerios on this spoon unlike the teeny baby spoons yet small enough to fit a toddler mouth . i rate this product stars because the forks aren t great . they are hard to use to stab and pick up items like eggs and pancakes .these are the best bottles ever and the only ones we ll use . cleaning them can be a pain because of all the parts but they are well worth it . we have them in ounce size and the fat ounce size and they are all perfect .these spoons are the perfect size for first feeders . the bowl of the spoon is narrow and not too deep so the food actually gets into my son s mouth . these are really light too unlike the spoons that have metal conponents . don t go with the more expensive spoons . these work the best are cheap and are bpa free and recyclable !
the isis breast pump is perfect for the breastfeeding stay at home mom . i used it a lot in the early months to relieve heavy engorged breasts and to help establish a good milk supply . with this pump i was able to keep a plentiful stock of breastmilk in my freezer . now that my little guy is one year old i only use it a couple of times a week but with good results . this helps me maintain a full supply .i cannot imagine using this pump for large quantities on a regular basis . if i was working outside the home i would definately purchase a good electric pump . the results in my opinion would be less tiring on your hand and much faster . using this pump would be way too time consuming . . .we moms know how precious time is when you have a baby to care for . stars for its effectiveness as a relief pump or to establish a mini stock . it encourages the let down reflex necessary to get an effective flow to begin the pumping process . the isis i have found to be much better than electric brands available in most baby departments . it is also easy to use one handed as sometimes i would pump one side while baby was nursing on the other .i am happy to have found this little pump . it has served me well for over a year now .the ideal pump for the semi regular pumping needs of any work stay at home breastfeeding mom !i borrowed this breast pump from my sister and it is awesome ! this is my third child and i have breastfeed all three . i have tried them all and this one is great . the one hand squeeze handle allows me to do other things while pumping ! i am only expressing twice a day so it is easy to clean ! what a great investment .recently while on vacation i misplaced the membranes for my medela pump in style breastpump which are vital for operation . the spare parts were safe at home and with a hungry boy on my hands i was in a predicament . unable to nurse i have provided my son with breastmilk by pumping three times a day since birth . i was concerned about maintaining my milk supply not to mention the discomfort of very full breasts so i purchased the isis breastpump because i use avent products and like the idea of being able to pump right into the feeding bottle oz oz or disposable . i am amazed by the comfort control and power this little hand pump provides . in addition i enjoy the convenience of not having to be plugged in and the reduced amount of bottles to wash . i found this pump to be great in a pinch or for a weekend away . however for my particular situation having to express ounces a day in order to keep up with my little guy the pump in style is superior to the isis both in speed and quantity of milk expressed .
 basic colors that can usually be found for a reasonable price . . .the pink blue orange green will show up on a color copy machine the yellow will not . . . .i m a bit of a pen fanatic and love to have a wide assortment of colors and types for different purposes . i got all the different sets i could find of the sakura brand and was very happy with them . this set includes lime deep purple coral orange yellow aqua magenta red marina blue and pink . all colors are fluorescent tones . note that these are my descriptions of the colors not theirs . these pen cases are clear and have a shiny colored cap that indicates the ink color which is imprinted with a crescent moon and one star . the ink is matte and vivid and goes on very smoothly .high quality consistent color and yes not cheap so i save this printer for the larger prints . works well with icc color profiles in photoshop .
fits my john deere lawn tractor which is model la and likely it fits all the l la and d series lower end john deere tractors . please post a comment if it does not and i ll update this reviewcurrently amazon says it does not fit my third generation miata nc but it doesthese filters come top in most online filter tests and i use them in almost all my carsperfect for exhaust work . i bought it for a catalytic converter and o sensor project because it is rated for f to fthey do work . exactly as advertised . hane no fear on buying these . fit the chevy silverado wt tailgate rods .
i was worried my dogs would get confused as to which doggie door to use . i have a patio door doggie door and when i closed my screen door my dogs could not get in or out . now with this in my screen door i can close the screen and my dogs can still get in or out . great idea and works well with the patio doggie doors . they are so smart they know which to use and when .these cat crazies make my two cats crazy . they re light enough so they can flip them around and into the air .we were looking at the glass door inserts but not only do they not allow your sliding door to lock but they are hundreds of dollars . since our only goal was a way to let our cats in and keep the flies out during the day we were leaving our screen door open for them this seemed like a perfect alternative .it was easy to install i do suggest leaving a little more screen then they suggest when you are doing the cutout and works great for letting them in and out .a couple of items about it to help you make your decision if you live where there are alot of mosquitoes or gnats they will be able to fit btwn the cracks in the unit . you will have to close the glass door to keep them out . works great for areas like ours in ca where we just have to worry about flys and wasps .i recommend installing it in the middle of the door . when i lock the cat door they paw at it if they want to go out and it can get rough on the screen . we installed it in the middle of the door and so we can just close the glass door halfway to keep them from pawing at it .
when it comes to moving large loads it s hard to beat a conventional welded hand truck . these will last a lifetime and can be a real back saver . but for those of us who travel and carry gear with us there are better solutions than the flimsy luggage carts with their tiny wheels .this magna cart personal hand truck was purchased on the street in a local brick and mortar retailer as an impulse item and at a time when it was sorely needed . it was bought to replace an older version similar to the magna cart elite hand truck and this review would not be here if my original hand truck had not disappeared from my possession . enough said on that .so what make this particular folding hand truck better than the average wire frame luggage carriers that we see sold at bargain prices ? here are a few subjective points from a return buyer followed followed by a more in depth look . pros rated at lb . capacity in practical use have carried lbs of gear inch wheels work well on elevators escalators commuter trains and such rubber wheels are non marking won t leave skid marks on floor or carpets ergonomic handle more comfortable in use than flimsy wire frame carriers wheels fold away rolls in a folded position when you don t want to carry it telescoping handle extends to inches won t break your back in use simple to use easy to carry easy to store weighs about pounds overall foldaway aluminum base plate about wide x deep cautions care needs to be used when first flipping the wheels into rolling position in use if you ve ever struggled in an airport terminal or train station with a bargain foldaway luggage carrier with its to flimsy wheels then you ll appreciate this folding hand truck the first time it s used and this is speaking from one who took that route years ago . there s a big difference between carts with tiny rollers and this with its inch rubber wheels though themagna cart elite hand truckwith its inch wheels is even smoother .i ve used this unit to carry luggage multiple cases of photo gear boxes of books and even cases of bottled water . it stows away quickly and easily in airline luggage racks in cars or in taxis when in transit . i ve humped photo gear and luggage up and down stairs and escalators in train stations and airport terminals and that s when one can really appreciate the inch wheels over anything smaller .you ll find these being sold as themilwaukee hand truck themagna cart personal hand truckthe harper folding hand truck and a variety of other names . just do a quick search here on amazon for the specs and the prices . some come with a basic bungee cord to help secure the load and others do not . themaster lock twin wire orange bungee cordis a good one but a better and more useful choice is themaster lock camlok adjustable steel cord bungee cord which quickly adjusts from about to inches in length . summary the magna cart personal hand truck is an excellent choice for travelers or commuters especially with its wheels that roll so easily . the handle extends easily to in overall height so it s a back saver when loaded . it is fairly lightweight and quickly folds to about a flat for storage . simple to use easy to carry and store this folding hand truck beats the average luggage cart hands down . easy to assemble no tools necessary except for a rubber mallet or hammer block of wood .very sturdy and the large wheels roll over door sills with little resistance . be sure to locate handle as pictured so the handle bracket is flush against the bottom of the top shelf .when installing wheels on the legs just invert the leg with the open end up position the wheel shaft in the leg tube and tap the leg on the floor a few times and wheels seat themselves .good product at a reasonable price quick amazon delivery .this type of a short truck in general has a design flaw of the axis far behind the handle so it tends when loaded to fall strongly pushes forward that requires a big effort to counteract puts significant strain on the user arm s muscles causing fast fatigue . in short it is a very bad type of a hand truck .in order to comfortably truck a load the handle must be behind the axis in relation to the ledge so as to provide leverage to easily balance the load over the axis by only slightly tilting back the truck . however tilting a short truck does not move much the handle back . so a proper design must compensate . it can be achieved by placing the axis just under the handle as in sparco compact luggage cart or by bending the handle toward the axis as in vestil steel hand truck or by both as in norris pound capacity multi purpose folding cart or safco . the lucky ones could find the yf black luggage cart for as little as in some cent stores .
i am usually against things made of plastic even though those without bpa . so i choose these bottles for my baby and so far so good . the only downside is that the slow flow nipples flow too fast for him and he chokes on them . i had to purchase nipples to fit these bottles and it s hard to find the right ones . i ordered some dr . brown standard nipples hoping to fit the bottles well .my favorite part about these bottles are the nipples . they are wide and a tad bit short and my babies latched wonderfully to these nipples . the slow flow nipple is very slow . but that s a good thing . most slow flow nipples drown my babies . the slow flow is great for breast milk . the medium flow nipple is great at about months with just formula no cereal . the fast flow nipple is amazing ! it works great on the dr browns bottles too vent aire nipples are my choice for dr browns bottles . cereal come through the fast flow nipple perfectly with no cutting of the nipple .these bottles are much easier to clean than dr brown s and they provide the same fluid flow as dr brown s without having to deal with the middle insert of the dr brown s .the cap on these bottles touches the top of the nipple and therefore the bottles do not leak while in the diaper bag . this is a major reason i love the bottles .two things i dislike about these bottles . you cannot mix four scoops of formula and oz of water in the bottle . there s no room to shake it all up . so i have to pre mix the formula and then pour into the bottles . dr brown s have more room in the bottles to accommodate all the water and powder . these bottles are crooked not straight so they are difficult to prop . with twins i had to prop bottles sometimes .mom of rnthese are one of only a few brands of bottles out there that has a variety of nipples so if your baby doesn t like one nipple you can try the others . most other bottles only offer one nipple and if your baby doesn t like it you have to buy a completely different set of bottles .these bottles are also interchangeable with the playtex premium bottles so you can have a variety of colors and designs .get an extra box of liners for each size .these are easy to clean just toss the liner and wash the bottle in warm soapy water . not scrubbing with a bottle brush to get the lump of formula out of the bottom . c 
like many people today i sit at a desk all day in front of a computer and often much of the night . as a result i often suffer from wrist shoulder and back pain . this m adjustable gel wrist rest platform helps alleviate some of the discomfort from the long hours spent at a keyboard . while it s not going to be a cure all it certainly helps by supporting your wrists and giving you an easier angle at which to type . here are my thoughts pros simple yet sturdy design is easy to assemble . plastic bottom of the wrist rest remains firmly in place on the base even without adhesive . doesn t soak up sweat from your wrist and provides firm support . keyboard position change doesn t take long to get used to .cons some extra adhesive circles rubber feet would have been nice in case you wanted to switch negative positive keyboard platform positioning . plastic riser board only fits the most conventional rectangular keyboards . some ergonomic or larger keyboards will not fit on the board after wrist rest is in place . faux leatherette pattern on wrist rest may not appeal to everyone . retail price is rather high considering what you get . gel in wrist rest pad may be too firm for some . not really adjustable this item comes with a sturdy gray plastic keyboard platform about the thickness of a kitchen cutting board . the black faux leatherette antimicrobial gel wrist rest which adheres easily to the platform . six adhesive rubber feet large small that can be place on the bottom of the keyboard platform to adjust the height and angle . and finally four pieces of m dual lock velcro adhesive . my main concern about the item was the cost . while the leatherette wrist rest is extremely nice it still seemed a bit overpriced for the rest of what you receive . there are probably other adjustable keyboard platforms out there for a lower price but you may not get such a nice wrist wrest to go along with it .the m tilt adjustable gel wrist rest platform claims that it encourages a comfortable neutral wrist position . like many people i spend a lot of time on my computer so i m always eager to try out any product that helps with comfort and ergonomics . does the m wr le s performance justify the high cost ? let s find out .platformthe platform is the only feature that separates this product from plain wrist rests . it s a strong plastic platform to place your keyboard onto . there s space in front for the included padded wrist rest and two sets of rubber feet are also included . i assume the rubber feet are why m describes the platform as being adjustable but i wouldn t call it truly adjustable since you can t adjust them on the fly .the rubber feet come in two sizes and attach to the bottom of the platform using m adhesive . attaching them to the rear of the platform for a positive tilt is easy since there are templates indicating where to put them . every single keyboard i ve ever used except for kinesis contour keyboards had positive tilt feet legs . the true benefit of the m platform is its ability to produce a negative tilt . unfortunately if you want the platform on a negative tilt you ll have to eyeball the rubber feet on your own m forgot to include templates for negative tilt feet .wrist restthe included wrist rest is very very nice . it has antimicrobial protection and is filled with a not too soft but not too hard gel . the wrist rest is wrapped in a soft leather like material and is by far the most comfortable and durable i ve ever used . i ended up just tossing the platform to the side and using the wrist rest by itself .conclusionmy experience with the m tilt adjustable gel wrist rest platform was rather disappointing . it s not truly adjustable and m failed to provide templates for accurately attaching the rubber feet for negative tilt . if not for the wonderful wrist rest that was included i would have rated it even less . the thing is you can buy the wrist rest by itself for less than half the cost of this platform wrist rest combo . i suggest you do just that and forget about the platform .the m tilt adjustable gel wrist mouse pad is a great idea if you re looking to improve your computer station either at home or at work . the mouse pad is tilt adjustable with a variety of settings . it is easy to assembly you simply stick on the height adjusters on the bottom of the mouse pad . this will hold it steady and also give the mouse a comfortable angle which is easy on your wrists . the platform also comes with a gel filled wrist pad and an antibacterial coating to keep germs away . it s a must have for anyone who is on the pc for extended periods of time . it also goes side by side with the m tilt adjustable gel wrist rest platform keyboard platform .
these horns are just the ticket in replacing stock inferior horns . these are a much nicer sounding horn than the loud blast of an air horn . perfect horns to boost the warning ability of your vehicle without sounding like a big rig .first you will need to buy the high tone also or it will sound stupid . it is part . i have put these pair on my last cars . the low tone does have a habit of failing if it gets wet . this has happened twice to me . for some reason the high tone works fine if it gets wet . make sure you mount the low tone in a location where it will not get wet .the kit does not include a relay . you may want to install a relay especially if your car is wired for one horn . the horns draw . a each at v . this is usually within factory limits and most fuseboxes will have a a or larger relay built in the horn circuit . the kit does include female blade connectors a mounting bracket and nut and a jumper wire needed if your car is wired with one horn lead .and they are very loud . packaging declares db at inches . i do not have a db meter but i can assure you the horns will get the job done . the pair has a nice tone and will rid your car of the little factory meep meep horns .needed something to plug into my camping travel trailer to monitor my volt connected in series to make one large long lasting v battery batteries . . . . this thing worked perfect ! when you turn anything on it register the drop in voltage and just seems to show the correct battery level perfectly at all times . it drops down to yellow when you kick on the heater and what not but that just means it is showing you where the levels are at with that kind of load . makes monitoring my batteries simple as can be !
perfect school supplies for my second grade student . we go through so much of this wide ruled loose filler paper each school year .this one is able to stand up to heavy duty college student use . excellent durability !unless your instructor requires you for having high class graphic calculator that you can see entire graph on the screen this calculator does good job through lower calc class . i got this a bit over at wal mart and it s been lasting years now . no issues or no problem whatsoever .
this device is a converter that works with rca inputs and outputs . the input seems to be geared for the db range for consumer level audio range . this box also has the ability to monitor the input directly with headphones .each bx d speaker has its own amp onboard and power supply . want a channel system buy speakers and run xlr audio to each one . no noise or hum . has both trs and xlr inputs has a knob for gain control on back . most importantly each speaker has an iec connector for power to just that speaker . mine sit left and right of my mixing panel using trs outputs which copy the xlrs those go to my marantz pmd digital recorder w gb of datacard memory onboard and a nice set of vu meters . speakers include a foam stick on bottom to prevent buzzing against hard surfaces . there is however no mounting point no captive nuts or such .you ll need to adopt a philosophy on gain . you can crank the speaker gain to and use your mixer to set the levels but ensure that your recorder gets enough signal to be in the to db range . it may be a tad loud in that case you may want to set both speakers to their oclock position which is power approximately .you could alternately use the mixer to run near db and turn it way down on the speakers . i like to use mine to listen to talk shows before falling asleep at night so i turn the volume way down but drive them with db off the mixer .having a separate power supply and amp for each speaker makes for some great isolation .my first nitpick is there is no grill cover on these like other maudio products have . i will have to fabricate some protection . my second nitpick is i owned the smaller m audio monitors where the amps were in the left speaker and the right speaker connected with twin lead speaker wire to the left i .e . not true bi amping but smaller spkrs for my mixer . the speaker w amps died at mos after buying it . it was not the power supply as being on made the box warm but the led surround around the vol knob would not light and you could barely hear the audio even with db into the trs line in . thats a different cheaper model by maudio but i had to trash it and buy these which are much nicer !i do like this set of speakers . from stereo to . surround they do the job with differential audio inputs . i may get more for ch as i have a sub already .good sound very very low noise except on high gain when switching to direct monitoring the output volume cuts to half expensiveif you re planing to record on computer buy a usb mixer for the same price you ll get a lot of stuff and a mixerworks with ios if you have an external power supply powered hub 
light weight easy to install holds very well does exactly what it was designed to do hold a guitar on a wallvery good and very useful device . very solidly built and it does what it was designed to do very very well .it sticks on forever and holds lots of picks . it does exactly what it says it does . its also very cheap .
as a lot of epiphone owners have learned cases designed for the gibson es clones won t fit epiphone guitars as the epiphones have a slightly larger headstock . this case however fits my dot custom like a glove . the padding is perfect the top is arched to precisely fit the guitar and the build quality is better than you might expect at this price level .there seems to be a lot of know it alls when it comes to this case . one reviewer says it s made by fender . i seriously doubt that and have to wonder on what he bases that on . show me proof . someone else seems to think it s made by epiphone . sorry to disappoint you but epiphone doesn t make cases . they accept bids from case manufacturers who can build a case to thier specifications at the lowest cost . i have several epiphone dots and a gibson es . i bought epiphone cases for all of them . i found the gibson case to be identical except for the color of the lining and the logo on the outside of the case . i couldn t see any sense in paying more money just for the gibson name . my gibson fits perfectly in the epiphone case . although the cases have the epiphone logo on the outside they are all made by tkl . how do i know that you re wondering ? they have a tkl tag on the inside of the accessory compartment . that s been a few years ago . the cases you get now could be made by a different company . the case is very heavy and is actually heavier than the guitar . regardless of who actually makes the case it has to meet epiphone s manufacturing standards so it s got to be good . this case will fit the dot casino sheraton and the gibson es . anyone who knows anything about guitars knows that the epiphone joe pass emperor ii has a much thicker body than the dot . this case was not intended for the emperor ii . it s a great case and will protect your guitar but it s not designed to be thrown from a rooftop or run over by a car . i just bought two more of these cases for my harmony rockets . one is a single cutaway reissue and the other is a vintage double cutaway . both guitars fit perfectly .the fender mini electric guitar stand is not made for the fender squire mini guitar . the guitar falls through . i will have to buy a differant stand for him rendering this one useless . the fender stand for standard guitars will not work on the size ether .
my vehicle honda acura tl spd j a vtec .the originals were made in the usa but these are made in japan by ngk or nippon touki japan porcelain . iridium tipped plugs are generally used on reciprocating powerplant equipped airplanes . incidentally iridium platinum plugs are generally pre gapped at factory and do not need re gapping some exceptions apply . if re gapped incorrectly the tip would be damaged .these are well made inexpensive and work great . they are quality made in usa !and they had no shipping charges if added onto an existing amazon order .what can one say test leads they work and they are priced right one recommendation is to sell a kit with an assortment of ends .
the plastic is very good quality the brush does a great job . . .not much else to say . . .no complaints . i prefer using a brass scraper as it won t scratch the glass as easily as plastic this scraper will scratch paint glass if you aren t careful .this treatment works well to kill rust and should be used along with a good rust primer and top coat paint to prevent future reoccurrence of corrosion returning . this product essentially treats the rust as the surface of the metal becomes pitted and sanding or grinding does not remove all of it before painting . good product to use in any area you do not want to continually do over . this product is an absolute must to have on the shelf for any auto or product used in high salt states such as in the northeast area of the country . small price to pay for an added layer of security to your rust prevention project .this scratch remover seems to be more of a polish and lube that will remove the surface scratches for the paint . it does not appear to have any grinding type ingredients in the paste .it will have little of no impact on deep scratches or deep nicks in the paint . it is easy to out on and remove and will a decent job for those light scratches . it did not remove any discoloring on my paint such as a stain left by a bird dropping . it ddi make the blemish lighter though .
this little amp is amazing . it s loaded with a lot of samples of other great amps and you can plug it in to your laptop and record it directly and you can go online and download other samples directly to your amp . i love it ! if you need a practice amp and you can plug your headphones in to it so you can practice in private then this is the amp you should buy . the price is right and the size is right . enough said . buy it !i use this often to record my band s gigs . now if they would make one that will hold a par can so i can turn my extra mic stands into single can lighting racks !five stars because it works on my digitech gnx guitar processor which requires volts and about milli amps . this has an output of milli amps . for electronics the voltage has to be correct . but an appliance will only draw as many amps current as it needs . so this adapter is coasting when used with the guitar processor and can be used with other devices that draw up to the mamps . just be sure your v device doesn t require more than the ma this can deliver . but it s a power adapter i cannot be in love with a power adapter .
this is a good quality notebook which features thick paper and a divided structure to the page . here s the question since you can create the effect of having a divided note section by drawing a line down the page of any notebook do you really need this pre divided notebook ? probably not . but it is easy to see how you could find this structure convenient taking verbatim notes on one side and your thoughts on the other arguments from one side on one side and your rebuttals on the other and so on .the division of space between the two columns is probably just about perfect . the section at the top is probably wasted space for many however . and i fear that anyone who i would affectionately term ocd enough to want those columns would probably be perpetually annoyed by the little page and date descriptions if they are used to putting their dates elsewhere and or don t need to number their pages .a good quality product but one that not all will want or need . recommended with caveats .i have been using this notebook as my brain dump location for the past week and for the most part it s pretty great . i ve been experimenting with the bullet journal system and that s what i m using this notebook for . if you haven t heard of it google it . it s just a method for note taking and to do lists that really makes sense and the guy who invented it has a free website that explains everything .anyways let s just do a quick list of pros and cons for this notebook to keep things simple .pros . nice design that gives a little more structure than a normal notebook page yet enough flexibility to change things up . each page has a header section divided into five boxes two of which are labeled page and date . this works perfectly with the bullet journaling system because you always want to put the date at the top and number your pages so you can add them to the index later . this would also be helpful if you were keeping notes on a college class or had other reasons to keep track of notes on certain page numbers . . the rest of the page is divided into two columns . the left column has a very small notes header and is blank no lines the right column is lined with numbers down the side . the lines are approximately the same size as wide ruled paper which i saw some people didn t like but i actually like that for to do lists . it keeps things from getting too cluttered . . each page is perforated so you can remove it but they are not going anywhere unless you want them to . the spiral binding is solid and holds each page securely unless you really want to remove it . . each page has an identical layout front and back so you can do double page spreads with no problem . . i like the size of this notebook . the paper is about half an inch bigger than a standard sheet of lined paper so more room to make notes .cons . i hate the cambridge limited logo on the bottom of every single page . this distracts me and feels intrusive on my thought process and it just makes my page look messy . i don t like it not at all . . having the numbered list go to is fine for to do lists or creating a calendar for the month of february but having it go to or ideally would make it much more flexible . i like to have a calendar page for each month and the numbered list isn t long enough to do that without handwriting the numbers in . . paper is just normal paper and not very heavy . my ultra fine sharpie pen bleeds through like crazy . my regular ball point pens are okay but still leave some indentations on the paper that show through the other side . pencil would be no problem though .final thoughts this notebook has some really nice features and i will be happy to use it until it s filled . it s not perfectly suited to what i m trying to do with the bullet journaling planning to get a moleskin graph paper one next time for that but i can see this being an especially great fit for a college student who needs to take notes on classes . it s awesome for dumping your brain at the end of the day and at the time of writing this review it s on sale for around i definitely would pay that for it . but is pushing it especially with that cambridge limited logo at the bottom of each page . the logo is really what cost this notebook major stars from me .i received this spiral notebook as part of the vine program . i m chuckling at the reviews of males evidently who received a pink cover . mine is black . i d happily switch with one of the gents for a pink one if that were feasible . the spiral on this notebook is very robust not flimsy at all . this notebook has college ruled pages . i like college ruled lines allowing for more information per page . there s also one storage pocket page in the very front . the back cover is also pretty thick so the whole thing holds up very well .if you don t have any expectations of this item doing more for you than providing a stable surface on which to take notes make lists solving problems of the math variety or doodle then you won t be disappointed in this item .
works perfectly on engine and transmission oil drain plugs on all cars and most valve gaskets on imports . i use this stuff any where i can on the engine to prevent leaks happening .fits my silverado ls . l vortec rwd extended cab . very simple install don t remove the third bolt closest to the driver side of the under dash shield you can move it out of the way without taking it all the way off saving you a headache trying to line the cover back up again . doesn t have a fresh breeze smell and i can still smell the dirty air of city driving but still a huge upgrade from what i had in there . basically a pile of dirt and leaves with some filter in the middle . air flow is superb .the good it adds significant security to a trailer . the lock for the coupler latch can fit the wider models . the lock that fits in the tongue where the hitch ball goes is easy to get on and off .why it doesn t get five stars the lock for the coupler latch even when lubricated and the cover on was a pita to get the key inserted and wiggled in after the trailer was in one place for a couple months . i was fearing that the key would break . the tongue lock it was hard to tell where to pull out the key .would i buy this again ? yes . however the lock for the coupler latch i would throw away and instead i would consider using a long shackle padlock or a lock that has an automotive grade cylinder . in all cases i d use some tri flow or another locksmith grade lubricant in all locks not wd ! 
works great for changing guitar strings . good build and doesn t look cheap . built in string cutter and bridge pin remover is a plus . bucks is better than for the tube screamer from ibanez and the sound is very similar based on youtube . i use this on the clean channel of my bugera v tube amp and it makes my guitars sound like they should . awesome with my ltd vc with and jb pickups .a good piece of kit . except it does have problems removing occasional sticky string pegs . it s also squeakily noisy when string winding . the cutter works perfectly .
very versatile power supply and much cheaper than others . this is not true isolated outputs but it is quiet and that is what counts . i have the fuel tank chameleon and i end up using this because it fits the needs of the pedals on my board the best mainly because of the ma output . here is a comparison of the jp chameleon and the onespot . i have all three .t rex fuel tank chameleon ma outputs v v maoutput v v maoutput v v ma use or only not bothoutput v ac majoyo sp ma outputs v maoutput dc v maximum output of maoutput dc v maoutput dc v mavisual sound onespot ma v only daisy chain power into pedals not exceeding mathis device is a converter that works with rca inputs and outputs . the input seems to be geared for the db range for consumer level audio range . this box also has the ability to monitor the input directly with headphones .notice in the name guitar input . this is not to be confused with the amplitube irig which achieves input and output through the ipad ios devices headphone jack . headphone connections can be noisy and have reliable connection problems . they also depend on the built in ad da converters in the ipad ios device . this apogee jam k is a professional quality input device that has dedicated a d analogue to digital converter but depends on the built in hardware of the ipad ios device for playback . on the other hand apogee one has both ad and da convertors for both input and output .amplitube irig from ik multimedia has a simple stereo headphone in and out jack plug that plugs into your ipad . the built in hardware in the ipad is something that i love for doing something like watching a movie cozying up to the inch screen but for audio phile quality you need a dedicated a dedicated pre and ad convertor and that is what this apogee jam k has . mind you it has that for audio recording input but playback is handled via your headphone jack on your ipad . you can of course just use that for monitoring your mix and then save the file in a digital format internally and send to a playback device with pristine digital audio quality e .g . saving as a .wav file . this makes the apogee k jam a very usable device to achieve high quality recordings at a very nice price .so here it the continuum . amplitube irig for headphone jack input and output quality built into your ipad etc . the apogee jam k for digital quality conversion on input only with playback being handled by headphone jack on ipad . the apogee one on the other hand at roughly times the price gives you both ad da conversions so it has its own audio output jack plus tracks of recording either instrument and or a balanced external microphone jack . it also comes with a built in condenser mic that is pretty amazing . it also has volt phantom power for using your favorite condenser mic . when you get into the apogee duet and quartet you get more connections plus the all too important option of midi connectivity .
fits on my hi lift jack just fine . does exactly what it is supposed to do .if you are using it on wheels that are deep make sure the straps are long enough to reach the spoke pattern .the tender jr . does not come with a cigarette adapter so i cut this in half to make two . i purchased lighter plugs for a buck each from china with free shipping and they are working fine . these aren t an exact match with the tender cables but they fit together ok and are easy to determine polarity with the wire colors . you can also just use this as an extension cord for your tender . the description states a length of inches but it s actually inches tip to tip on the connectors . nice item for the price and it s made in mexico .works great . fairly easy swap . just be aware the front window regulators are the same on whether you have a suburban or tahoe or one of their gm family members . not so for the rear regulators . the full size suvs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones . the vehicle input feature amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference . the pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at but the vehicle id feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit . beware ! ! ! ! just so you know the dorman and fit the full size and the and fit the tahoe size vehicles .
this is a terrible dog toy . we received the stegasaurus version of the toy . the seams from the plastic mold are incredibly hard and actually sharp . unfortunately i gave this to the dog without first investigating it and he quickly began bleeding from cut gums . even if you shaved those off the stegasaurus s wide awkward shape is bad for a medium or small dog at least . the hard bumps all over the outside seam weird . if they were softer i could see how it would be a gum massage but these are super hard .i ve got the t rex one . it doesn t feel like rubber it feels like hard plastic ! it s also pretty sharp around the edges . i m surprised at the number of star reviews . maybe it s just me but i m not giving it to me puppy cause i m afraid it might hurt his gums .i placed an order couple days ago and it arrived yesterday . very impressed that it got here super quick especially on a saturday . i was really hoping to get the t rex chew toy but got the stegosaurus instead . the choice is random you can t pick what dinosaur you want which is kind of a bummer . i was reading through many of the reviews and they were mixed between positive negative so i decided to purchase it to see what it was like for myself .i thought it was actual bone material but quickly discovered it to be plastic with little bumps on it . my dog is a very aggressive chewer and she hasn t chewed through it . she seems to enjoy it very much and so far there s no cracked or broken teeth ! knock on wood i m not too pleased that the chew toy is plastic though . probably won t purchase again as it could be hazardous to my dog s teeth .
it is just what i needed to organize my changer table . be aware that this product is not for a crib or a changer dresser or table top . also the edge of the changer table needs to be less than an inch for it to fit properly .this was a total piece of garbage . several things are wrong . . it doesnt fit every changing table . when i attach it to mine it tilts downward and is not level at all . you need to have a bottom slat or base to support it under the top slat it will go onto . . the side compartments keep falling off because they dont attach they just fit over the edges . . the biggest complaint is that the wipe tray does not fit every wipe box or wipe warmer and we have the same brand name wipe warmer that made this product . . consider that you will be taking away inches of walk space around your changing table after you put this hunk of plastic onto it .if you have your changing table in a small area or corner of a room this makes a difference .what a cheaply made piece of plastic .pass this up and buy a wall shelf to go over the changing table instead .i use this for my portable changing pad and under the sheet in my daughters cradle . it is a bit wide for my cradle so i just tuck in the sides . it is wide for the portable changing pad but still works good !
perfect fit for rear window on my ford excursion limited . easy to install . no spotting seen or squeaking at allbought this to install with an aftermarket kenwood navigation on my toyota tacoma . it took several hours to install but it works great with the wheel controls in my toyota .this fits not only the ecotec but newer vw tdi s with the canister filter . works great relatively low profile and goes nicely on a drive . i accidentally ordered three fat fingered the cart and sold one to a fellow vw driver and one to a guy with a gm .
there is rubber on the bottom for no slip and rubber on the top for no slip as well ! height could be a bit taller but most are about the same height .do not look at the weight ranges when deciding on a size . my son is at the top end of the size large weight range but this item will still fit him for many months . instead look at the height ranges for a more accurate size determination . my tall son is growing out of size month clothing but the size large sleepsack size months will fit him for many more months .we have a doorway between the front room and kitchen that must be a non standard width because the gate alone is a smidge too small but when we added the extension the whole unit wouldn t fit in the doorway . it would be better design if there was an overlap of about between the two sizes .
this product has a mono microphone input and a stereo headphone output . it is meant for connecting a headset to a usb port . since the headset has a mono microphone this adapter works great . the drivers automatically install on microsoft operating systems . this product is great for using a soft phone or other communications program . the windows systems remembers volume settings each time it is connected . i imagine that you could use something other than a headset with this but it was mainly built for a headset . works seemless and great with a headset .while i have heard that these devices can be great for recording concerts and have heard some great recordings to back that claim up my review will be focusing on my main use which is podcasting . after using the zoom h n for a few weeks i ve found it to be a very versatile tool that should be in any podcaster s arsenal of gear .i mainly use the h n to record my podcasts using a allen heath zed mixing board . i usually do a two person podcast where i am in one location and the other person is brought in via skype . using the aux sends of the board and the track mode of the h n i can record myself in one channel the other person in another channel and all of the sound effects and music supplied by my ipad into its own stereo channel . this makes editing a breeze as everything is on its own track .the sound quality of the h n is excellent and it is very easy to hook up external microphones to the unit . you can hook up either two xlr microphones or two jack sources or a combination to the bottom of the unit and there is one input on the back of the unit that will accept a stereo microphone or any line level stereo source . it s the combination of these that lets me record the podcast onto the separate tracks .the h n will also let you record using two attached microphones and the internal microphones at the same time as well which could be useful if you re looking to capture some background noise if you are recording something on location or say to mix the crowd reaction to a soundboard feed .overall this is a great device for podcasters both in the studio and out in the field letting you produce high quality recordings in both environments . five stars without a doubt .im starting a podcast . i blindly lept to buy the blue yeti . i can understand why one person with a youtube channel would love this . great for voice overs . in sound proof studios . the sound quality was good but it picked up way to much room noise . the ability to select the recording modes is great . if youll use it . i would not reccomend recording people at once on this . however recording a choir or something would work . but i will never do that and neither will you . this microphone only has a usb port . not xlr . so no hope of expanding . if you ever want to host a podcast with people you need to throw this away and get a mixer and new microphones .or you can do what i did and get audio technica atr s behringer xenyx dual mic input mixer shock mount broadcast boom combos and windscreens for the same price as a yeti raidus shock mount the pop pop filter and a generic mic stand .now i can replace my mixer and keep my mics or replace the mics then the mixer and do all sorts of expansions and add ons as well as get quality audio for hosts on my podcast .do not get this yeti unless your doing youtube voiceovers by yourself forever
i use these patch cables on my pedal board and they save valuable space . they work well and i haven t had any problems with any of them shorting out or making static or other noises . i highly recommend them . plus they look nice unlike the various colors that come with the bulkier cheaper cords .i tried with with my macbook pro with both mountain lion and mavericks . also with my win x machine . i tried it with a variety of midi capable gear including trying to update firmware on fx hardware sending and receiving midi pc and midi cc as well as transmitting midi clock in and out . i simply couldn t get this to work most of the time . active sense used on most roland products seems to kill it completely .in contrast i purchased the mu s xmidi x tab and it works flawlessly and without issue every time i use it .i should have totally returned this product . instead it s in a landfill .i purchased this because even though i use mostly boss effects i also use a behringer hell babe wah . some of the reviews mentioned that boss effects fit perfectly and that there is a footprint for a wah type effect . i must say thanks to those reviewers ! the only issue i have is that i m kinda slow so it took me a while to realize that i had to unscrew a part of the actual board in order for the wah to sit comfortably . i was also a little bit apprehensive about using the supplied adapter with all of my pedals in case there was some sort of conflict but so far it has been a perfect experience ! this is such a sturdy board . i must say though that i had no idea it would be so huge ! this is a perfect addition to any serious rig . update i ve finally filled all the available slots with the addition of the boss phase shifter . so far this board has performed superbly ! yes there is some noise as there always is when using overdrive distortion pedals but no more than is to be expected . i use a boss noise suppressor sorry if this is beginning to look like a boss ad and it works perfectly !
i don t have enough room on my patio to use a screw post to attach to so i attached the ends to patio post with eye bolts . then i slipped a short leash handle on the cable so my dog can walk all around the patio .works good because i can work on stuff like the violin i am working on and have her with me . she can walk around my patio .my front yard doesn t have a fence and it is where my kids play . my dog loves to play with them and now he can . this holds nicely and isn t horrible to install in the ground .we have a medium sized dog so feet of chain was quite a bit for her to drag around the yard . the chain would get wrapped around things or get caught on roots and the dog couldn t reach her house . . .well that can t continue so i got this cable hoping it would be better on those things .it s better than a chain in every way imaginable .it is much lighter than chain so it s easier for the dog to run around without having to drag all that weight . the cable is stiff enough that it doesn t twist into small loops that will get caught on anything so no more having to go out and unsnag a chain at am . the manufacturer even put so much thought into this tie out that they have the end you hook to the dog s collar spring loaded so that if she runs to the reach of the cable chasing a bird or rabbit she doesn t get such a hard jerk on her collar when the cable gets taut .i honestly have nothing bad to say about this tie out cable . it does exactly what a dog tie out should do and does it better than a chain or a rope . for the benefits it gives my dog being tied with this i consider this money very well spent .
with the pet piller it is easy to sneak the pill into the side of my cat s mouth . it safely places the pill in the back of the throat . the piller has a soft flexible tip so that a whole pill or a portion can be quickly placed where the cat cannot spit it out .this does exactly as advertized . the little ledge on the top makes it easy to slip under your litter box and it s easy to lift up and shake out over a trash can .this is very large and sturdy . it requires a broomstick through the handle to work it into the ground but it will not come out anytime soon . i have a lab and it stands up to her strength .
this is great for a newborn baby . it makes giving a bath so much easier because the baby can hang out in the sling . highly recommended .we like that this tub is large enough to bathe a toddler in . it can be used for both babies and those that are old enough to sit up on their ownbaby loves to chill on this . its great for tummy time and also used to hold baby while breastfeeding or bottle feeding .
solid music stand made of heavy metal poles and solid metal music holder . the joints that you tighten are made of a heav plastic material . if anything were to give out from use it would be the plastic parts . right now in brand new condition everything fits well and grips solidly to hold poles in place . arrived a day erly .well made works like a charm and felt like it was made with quality material and not made of cheap parts and plastic .levy s leathers could have made this guitar strap out of a softer material especially on the edges . it cuts into your neck horribly even thru a shirt . yukko . the fake leather on the ends are unbelievably cheap .
fits very well on my les paul its working great but it does not work in stereo . it is a mono adapter the stereo adapters are a little more expensive .easy to use portable cheap . not exact in tuning might want a more expensive one if you are a professional musican . for most of us this is more than adequate .
in theory this looks like it might be useful . however the side compartments are really small . not even an average size bottle of cornstarch can fit in it . when i try go to remove something from there like a tube of cream the plastic side piece detaches and i have to click it back into place all of these pieces can disconnect which could be nice but i found that they would disconnect when i did not want them to . the diaper areas in the front do not hold many diapers at all . the top doesn t have a non slip grip so the box of wipes just slides all over . pain in the rear . i returned this and bought a large basket that i keep on the changing table edge and just put all my supplies into .this gate was a replacement for the crappy swing n lock . this gate is so easy to install . the only problem was we have baseboards and couldn t use the template . so i simply measure inches off the floor and then marked the holes to drill and folded the template to get the upper holes marked . we did however have a lot of wall damage due to the fact that this was installed on the metal corner protectors under the drywall and a lot of the joint compound fell off due to disturbing it . i will not fix it now since i m sure i ll have more to fix later . i like this gate because it has two point of contact in the locked and closed position . both rails the upper and lower fit about inch into a metal seat . this makes it so secure . i don t agree w the other reviewers that said the lower rail pops out i m sure if it was installed wrong . just make sure to measure properly and make sure things are even level and line up and there is no way the rail is going to pop out ! i did pinch myself a few times opening this the first few times . you have to slide the rail in a bit to swing it and there s a metal piece on the top rail that supports the two gates ouch . will remember not to do that !the opening on this is too narrow to accommodate iphone ipod macbook adapters . if the cover were taller it wouldn t be an issue because the whole adapter could fit inside but it s not . it s just too short even for the smallest of the apple adapters . so i had to return this anyway but if i d kept it i would only have wanted to use it for a power strip that i never need to add remove plugs on the tabs to open the cover are a serious pain . . .and ironically would be easier to open if my hands were smaller .
i have a gal tank and use this during the day after the main morning feeding . silver dollars and convect all loves this ! i keep the power head on when i sprinkle them on the surface of the water this gives the fish a nice little work out chasing their treats . the . oz can is stuffed with a whole lotta worms ! freeze dried of course . one last thing the lid on the can was partially opened but the plastic top was securely snapped in place when the package arrived it did not appear as if any product was missing and no contents were spilled .very satisfied with how much the fish love this food ! ! ! !i like this product it works well for me . i use it when i am gone days . i freeze about half the cat s food in the tray and refrigerate the rest before putting it in . i also use the ice trays . this way i avoid the problem some people have had with the food going bad . the frozen portion thaws out slowly . when you prepare the tray be sure the food is in the right slot and rotation so that the frozen food is accessed last .i purchased this being i ve bought it in the past . if you only have a few fish the large container of flakes food will last a long time thus a really great price .
i purchased this key on a whim . when it arrived the instructions were not clear but i sat the dial to loosened all of the lugs on my floor tom and went around my lugs using opposing lug patterns and tested the first cut of tuning . too loose and deep so i increased the setting to and repeated . almost the sound i wanted so i used a regular key and went an eighth turn using the same pattern . perfect . i then started on the next largest tom working back to the smallest . using the setting plus an eighth turn i got my toms octave apart .next i worked on my snare drum starting with the snare side then the batter side . i used on the batter side and on the snare side and managed to get the crisp yet warm sound i wanted . the bass drum came next i set the batter side tension notch below the resonant side and achieve a great tuning . from there i went back and set the resonant sides of each of my four toms one notch higher than the batter side and marveled at the perfect tuning i attained .this is an easy device to use with the lever facing you move it to the left loosen all of your lugs then tighten each starting with one or two . when the lever clicks and moves to the right position you have reached the torque setting . test increase a notch if necessary and repeat until you get the sound you want . set the resonant heads either one notch higher or lower to make sure the batter and resonant heads do not cancel each other and to your desired sound and you will have a perfectly tuned set .i ll never go back to tuning by ear ! you ll be amazed by the results if you tune with this key and don t forget to write down your optimum settings .i bought these to replace the stock machine heads that came on my hondo ii the paul which i bought in . the stock ones were loose lots of backlash in the worm gears and the guitar kept going out of tune even after the strings were fairly stretched out but still new .they went in easily if you follow this hint if your machine head holes do not need to be enlarged disregard this hint the holes for the old machine heads on the hondo ii were . in diameter and these new grovers need a . diameter hole . so i had to find an accurate and clean way of enlarging the holes . it s almost impossible to use a drill even in a drill press without splintering the wood on both surfaces of the headstock . i read online suggestions about using a round wood file and reamer etc . . so what i did was first use a threading tap for metal screw threads which at the bottom had a . diameter and at the top had a . diameter . this is a standard threading tap . i chucked the tap into my battery powered hand drill set to low speed and used the threading tap to cleanly and carefully enlarge the headstock holes to . in diameter . then i used a tapered reamer from both sides to enlarge the holes to the required diameter . quick clean easy . if you have a different size enlargement to make use the appropriately sized taps and a tapered reamer to get the holes to . diameter .another hint which you should follow is to replace only one machine head at a time like when changing strings . you don t want to take the tension off the neck and mess around with the truss rod . at least i don t want to !now the guitar stays in tune and is easier and more accurate to tune .a very worthwhile upgrade ! zero backlash in the worm gears on the grovers beautifully chromed and smooth as silk .i had purchased one a while back for my electric and then my acoustic was always leaning against the wall so i had to get another for my acoustic . super simple to install and very sturdy once installed .
it is hard to find a printer that lists windows server as a compatible operating system . i tried some other brand printers and the drivers would refuse to install . even though canon support told me that this printer is not officially supported for server i installed the drivers anyway and it works perfect !i ve been using a dymo labelwriter twin turbo for about three years . i accidentally plugged in the wrong type of ac adapter into my usb hub and poof my printer blew out . so i ordered a new one . i can tell you that for a small home office environment and postage printing this printer will do the trick . the latest software synchronizes with your outlook contacts so it is easy breezy to create address labels for those who are in your outlook address book .i just received my replacement and there s a problem with the installation at least for windows . the disk that comes with the printer installs the software addressing stamps but does not install the driver . if you buy this printer and are running windows here s what you need to do go to dymo s website . . . and click on support drivers downloads . from here you can download the latest software and drivers and you ll be good to go . if this is a first time installation don t plug in the usb printer cable until prompted to do so by the software download .so aside from the installation problem this is a printer you can count on for the long haul provided you don t do something stupid like i did and blow it out with an incorrect ac adapter . lol !i have had this machine since june . this is a decent machine if you can get past its software .the good built in networking . the print quality is good . the cartridges don t run out too quickly and are widely available . the adf is very convenient . all the features are accessible over the network . works well under win xpthe bad the software is extremely bloated . count on at least a half hour to an hour per machine to install it for network use . the speed is not anywhere near advertised . we are talking more like s for the first black white copy to be complete in average mode not ppm . some features are badly broken under vista even with hp s latest vista drivers from march . a the ocr software produces garbage pdfs under vista . b the card reader doesn t work over the network even after applying one of hp s fixes tech support is terrible . i tried to escalate the vista problems but spent hours with someone in india who was useless and just couldn t do anything besides tell me to uninstall and reinstall the drivers thanks that didn t work . . . . no duplex printing scanning or copying . i need this for my next machine . but it won t be an hp due to the terrible problems with vista and tech support .
i have two of these installed on sliding cabinet doors . the doors are wood with a glossy melamine coating and the locks have stayed securely stuck for over a year . they are simple for an adult to use use thumb and finger to push both tabs down at the same time then slide door open . as long as there is or so of clearance between the doors they will slide freely with the lock compressed between them . upon closing the doors the lock s wings snap out again and the doors are automatically locked easy ! our son now months has not put great effort in trying to defeat the lock but i think it would be physically very difficult for a child his age to do so . he could easily apply the pressure necessary to press the wing down but to maintain that pressure on both wings while simultaneously opening the door is a tall order for a toddler .on the flip side while investigating the lock one day he pulled down hard on the top wing and it snapped right off . he went right over to our other cabinet and snapped the top wing off the lock on that one . he hasn t yet tried to break off the bottom wings and i believe that would be more difficult to do but i docked this product a star for the easily broken plastic . it was fully effective until age months i haven t found any alternatives that are as convenient as this and for the time being it remains effective even with one broken wing so it still gets four stars .this gate is very high quality and a snap to install . the pressure installation won t hurt your door frames and my month old daughter hangs attacks it frequently and it doesn t budge . the pedal operation is ingenious so much easier to open with your foot when you ve got your hands full . also swings both ways so you can push it open whether you re coming or going .highly recommend .these locks are awesome . we slid them into the folding spots on my preschooler s closet doors . the photo is misleading and makes it look like they lock in the middle between the doors but they actually slide into place where the doors fold so make sure to order two .
while these are thin the cloth folds on itself and creates sharp edges . the cloth is not soft enough to manuver easily around baby s bottom . also they are on the rough side which might be good for a sticky poo but they are not absorbant either and just smear the poo . if you are looking for a nice wipe go for the prince lionhart wipes .these pads are a complete waste of money . i started usinglansinoh disposable nursing pads packwhich are awesome ! but i was hoping that these would work because they are a little cheaper . they might work for you if you have extremely light or practically non existent leakage . but even in that case the absorbent material used in this product performs like a thin circular cotton ball it doesn t draw the moisture away from your skin which was extremely irritating to my skin and made me feel edgy and damp all the time .so here are the cons of this product there is no waterproof backing on these pads which is good for preventing thrush but is bad for holding leaks . my shirt and bra would end up damp anyway . the absorbent material does not draw moisture away from skin . my skin would end up wet and damp and hot . very uncomfortable . i had to change these pads constantly if i wanted to feel dry and comfortable thus removing the whole purpose of replacing a wonderful product lansinoh pads with a terrible but cheaper product . the mesh material that covered the absorbent material is irritating to my skin and would stick to the skin when i removed the pad . the mesh material also allowed fibers through that would stick all over my skin which would then end up rubbing off on my baby s face . these pads are small but puffy which would often show up in silhouette if wearing even a slightly fitted shirt . these are very thin and not as absorbent as other cloth wipes fleece that i ve used . they are good for wiping spit up moreso than baby bottoms .
i use it for my baby when traveling very portable and no need of battery is a plus of course pexcellent product very very useful while traveling there are electric plug points in all restaurants hotel rooms and at airport gates etc .very useful at home too .this high chair does its job and is an inexpensive alternative to other high chairs with the stand . its portable making it easy to take along when visiting friends without kids and can be attached on any dining chair no fold able chairs as highlighted by another reviewer . space saver and portable its also colorful and very easy to clean .
good product fulfills its promise . but your competitor api melafix is extremely concentrated and life in my tank only multiplies . my fish thank .this is an essential product in caring for tropical fish . get it now . i feel all seachem products are top notch .my tank has benefited from this product its wonderful now i have a seachem addiction . i have bought more of their products since this .
it does what it is supposed to do that is to increase placement distance from the car to the electrical outletit does what it is supposed to and suds up .does what it says it does . . . . . .looks great !
there are two pieces to the outlet cover back part replaces the outlet cover and needs to be screwed on and the front cover which is released from the back cover by squeezing the two plastic pieces on the sides . the plastic side pieces are part of the back part made of stiff plastic and extremely difficult to squeeze . this outlet cover also did not fit one of my outlets it would not stay flush to the wall .holds a power strip and plugs okay but my toddler can still get her fingers down in the cracks where the cords come out and the crack between the front piece of plastic and the longer back piece . mine is also a white color not the cream like it appears in the picture .i bought this neutral color off white cover upc model a i don t know how that differs from model andmommy s helper power strip safety coverto compare the two . unlike that item this cover is expandable from to . in length . the roughly cylindrical compartment is about . wide and high . the slot where the cords for the equipment come out is wide and a maximum of long . when closed the hole for the power strip cord is by . holes are provided in the base for wall mounting but no accessories are provided .to open the thing you press two tabs on the inner lower cover then slide off the outer cover then lift the inner top cover . place the power strip into the inner lower cover then replace the inner top cover then slide the inner cover into the outer cover .the plastic is stiffer compared with the mommy s helper model but it also seems more brittle . i don t like the fact that there is no way to flick the power strip switch without half disassembling the thing . it can hold a wider and higher strip and transformers than the mommy s helper model by about in either direction which is nice . buy this from amazon .com !
it is just what i needed to organize my changer table . be aware that this product is not for a crib or a changer dresser or table top . also the edge of the changer table needs to be less than an inch for it to fit properly .after purchasing the depot i found it does not work well on my changing table dresser style with fold out top . i had to put it on the side and was not pleased to find out that it is not possible to use unless it is hung . more bad news . . . i purchased the ultimate wipes warmer which will not fit on top of the depot while it is hanging on the side of the changing table . perhaps these products work fine with a typical changing table but keep in mind they do not work with a folding top dresser type .i use this for my portable changing pad and under the sheet in my daughters cradle . it is a bit wide for my cradle so i just tuck in the sides . it is wide for the portable changing pad but still works good !
if you hook them up right they work amazing . having so many settings allows me to have options for the mood i am in . the sound setting doesnt work so well unless the music is really blasting tho . other than that they are great .i bought about boxs for my pt . the top of my pt would make a flutering sound when driving not no more . also road sounds dimed down some . when it rains the top of my pt doesn t sound like a tin can anymore . . . .works great installed it on my motorcycle and also kept the high tone stock horn . with both horns the sound is very loud it will scare the crap out of any dummies that pull out in front of me now . db stock horn db stock horn fiammif you understand how decibel measurement works you will know that is a big increase in sound .
great product does what it needs to do if only the product works better for small baseboards under in . the template does not do well on baseboards since it will be short a few cm depend on how thick the baseboard is in depth .overall pretty sturdyeasy to put up . interrupts small creatures and urchins migratory patterns . does what it is supposed to do quite well even in the presence of major league baseboards .love these . . . . different colors the bottoms have a number on them and the holes match the number when possible is a triangle four is a square etc . . . also the number of holes matches the number on the cup . . . this toys will grow with my lo and has a small enough footprint that it can travel with us easily !
i threw the ones that came with my filter away . never had an issue . until recently my new apartment the floor is not level water tried spilling out of filter i got these and fixed it no problem .live by this stuff for water treatments . never had issues with fish death and they seem happy . cap iis easy to read with gal buckets .i put most of this bottle in a canister filter and the cloudy water was crystal clear in two days .
i use this brush on a lb yellow lab golden retriever mix who sheds like crazy . it does a good job on him especially when used with an undercoat brush . . . this helps remove a lot a hair and leaves his coat soft .my dog has really good teeth and i want to keep it that way . my previous dog had to have teeth extracted because of periodontal disease . my daisy loves the taste . what i like is the choice between the finger brush and the toothbrush . it s easy to train her to allow me to clean her teeth by using the finger brush first . daisy gets used to having her mouth and teeth handled . she is a rescued dog that i got when she was months old and she had not been properly trained or socialized . this is a really good product at a reasonable price .good brush . our lab husky pup has sensitive skin and this isn t exactly soft . i have bought another brush to replace this one that is softer for her fur skin .
this does exactly as advertized . the little ledge on the top makes it easy to slip under your litter box and it s easy to lift up and shake out over a trash can .works . . .hint if your wanting to make a curain of fine bubbles or there are some bare areas tap the tube with a needle pushing will create big bubbles !no more stinky pockets full of treats that i forget to take out . clips onto or loops through a belt . easy to fit my hand into and can tighten the drawstring so i don t lose treats bending down to get to my pets level 
it s larger than i expected but i will keep it until my son can fit into it . my son is lbs and around inches which is why i bought the large based on the weight recommendation but even the medium is quite large on him right now . would suggest using the height recommendation as a closer indicator of what size to buy rather than weight .i have written a previous review for this car seat but in reading recent reviews it seems that many people are still giving false info on this seat .the primo viaggio is not the safest infant car seat on the market ! i can honestly say that i am not sure why so many people make this claim but rest assured that while it is safe coming in at it is not the safest . if you want the safest infant seat you have to go with a graco snugride . many people also complain that this is the heaviest seat on the market and it is not even close to the heaviest . it actually weighs only lbs without the base . the lightest seat right now is lbs and the heaviest is lbs so peg perego is actually doing quite well in keeping the seat at a decient weight .i was until last month a department manager at a babies r us store but just left to take a different job . i know my stuff when it comes to car seats and strollers and i promise that this info is correct . if anyone has any questions about this seat or any other you can e mail me at saisajo yahoo .comotherwise i have written an old review for this car seat under the name lj and by clicking on my name under that review several other reviews will pop up . good luck and congratulations !my post baby weight was over lbs if you are over lbs this is not for you . i was only a few pounds over that so i thought it will be safe . err ! wrong answer i cracked the kneeler portion . what a blow to the postpartum ego .

i really could not see it do anything for me since i have well water and don t need the dechlorinator i wanted it more for stress . i m not sure if this is the product i needed .i use this for my pet rabbit and it is just fine i like the large size so i would not need to buy it all the time .i have an aquaponics system and in every forum i see this kit mentioned . i know now why because it has everything you really need . i won t need to look any further for another kit . i think they make a saltwater kit too which i m sure is just as great .
i have a . mo old who loves when we tap on toys when he has them in his mouth yes sounds weird . husband is a drummer and got him obsessed with the tapping even when he is drinking out of his bottle my baby will try to tap the bottle with his hands to feel the vibration . he has a mini dodge ball and he sticks his face mouth on the ball and all you have to do is tap the ball and he s a happy baby . i also bought an infant gum massager electric toothbrush because he was always interested when i brush my teeth . he loves that as well but has to be supervised so he doesn t choke you think for long skinny objects made for babies that they would make a guard block to prevent any type of choking .this teether will be better if it had an on off button my baby not able to bite down hard enough to turn it on and once again we have to hold it for him to turn it on . i was trying to find a teether with vibrations he can use by himself .this product sucks . my little boy loves to chew on things while he s teething and he bites down hard . he was never able to bite hard enough to get this dumb thing to vibrate . very disappointing .great toy for teething ! my daughter finds this very interesting especially when it gently vibrates and massages her gums . it didn t take her long to press down with her front teeth to activate the massaging action . she s enjoyed this just about everyday since we got it about months ago . no issues with it ! i sent one to a friend who just had her baby for when she starts teething .
not sure why this is listed as a toy i rated this as functional dinnerware cups not a toy .i purchased the original first years cup set with the sippy cup style and moved on to the straw set when my toddler was ready . they are just as sturdy with a non flexible straw . the colors are very vibrant with matching tops and straws .the only suggestion i have is insert the straw after you have placed liquid inside and capped it . otherwise the liquid will squirt right out .the cups wash up really well in the dishwasher . the straws fall through my utensil container so i do have to hand wash those but that is the only hassel .overall the cups are great for toddlers . my daughter can drop it and as long as it does not land on the top side it rarely leaks .i love the whole avent system ! these are great sippy cups in large part because all avent pieces are modular and fit each other . so if you have been using avent bottles you can put the sippy cup tops and handles on the bottles .you can pop out the magic valve that makes this a sippy cup and fit in the nipple from the bottle . or you can take the collars from your bottles and fit the magic valve in it . it is wonderful ! especially since you have so many ways to fit the sippy cup together if you have already been using avent bottles .love this bottle organizer so much i even took in on vacation with me . fits all size bottles sippie cups and suprisingly bowls i use avent bottles gerber cups take n toss bowls . there is a lot of space to organize bottles nipples sippie cup valves sippie cup lids spoons bowls etc . . . the only way it leaks is if you don t put over the sink which i don t because i like to leave it set up i just put a towl under it and it looks fine .
fits my low clearance mazda that comes with alloy wheels and inches of clearance between the inside of the tire and the suspension . have not tried it in the snow yet .the bag it came with dosent fit it if youve got it adjusted to the middle or top setting this does exactley what they say seems pretty rugged it fits my duratrac s perfect and holds my lb self no prob .fit my nissan frontier s oil pan perfectly . looks to be of nice quality . torque to ft lbs on the frontier anyway 
i have used mobil on all my vehicle s for years and after buying a new to me hd ultra limited was pleased to see the they also made the v twin moil for it . i call them to ask what makes this a better product than the oem oil that hd sell s and they explained that it is specially formulated to meet or exceed the requirement need with air cooled hd engineers as well as trans and primary case requirements . i believe that they manufacture a superior product and will be only running it on my bike .you can t say much about this quick disconnect plug . but one for sure having it installedcharging your motorcycle is much easier than using those old fashioned alligator clamps .if you also interested in buying a battery maintainer the harness is included in this one black decker bm b v and v battery charger maintainer http www .amazon .com gp product b d mp ref cm cr ryp prd ttl sol you may also like to hear that there is a adapter available from sae usb plug available sae to usb adapter motorcycle cell phone charger http www .amazon .com gp product b vffqre ref oh details o s i ?ie utf psc so if you also use a navigation system while riding you can easily charge this on the road .i was using this to power my viair p heavy duty portable compressor but with amp it doenst do the job returned it and went with schumacher v amp power converter good to go !
when you need a phone during an emergency or power outage when you want a phone that is reliably located on the base where someone hasn t walked away with the handset this is the ideal phone ! the phone comes with a longish cord to plug into the phone base and phone jack . if you need the standard short cord to use with a typical wall mounted base there is a slot under the base to wrap the cord instead of providing a shorter second cord . i like this ! it s nice that companies are engineering with cost savings in mind ! the phone comes with pulse and tone dialing needed to use computerized dialing . as a teacher and lecturer i was excited to learn of this remote control for presentation software . note that presentation software really means microsoft powerpoint . the presenter does not work with wordperfect s presentations software i can t comment about its use with other software . before buying this presenter i was tied to a podium as i felt that i needed to be within arm s length of the forward and backward buttons on the computer . however this presenter has a range of feet and includes a laser pointer which allows me to roam around the room . the presenter uses two aaa batteries and the power is controlled by the usb plug that is stored in the pointer itself . storing the usb plug in the pointer turns the pointer off while removing the plug from the pointer turns it on . the usb plug needs to be inserted into a computer and then receives the signal from the presenter pointer to control the presentation . the most complex part of using the device is installing and changing the batteries which is not complex at all . the presenter has a nice rounded contoured shape and is comfortable to hold . using this remote presenter is a truly liberating experience and a benefit to those who use powerpoint for presentations .you learn that when there is a power outage the cordless will not work because the base is plugged into the electrical socket so its a good little phone to have plugged into a landline that s there when you need it even if you have a cell phone . . . .because you could have a low battery and this landline though to some out dated it sure helps in a pinch . !
i bought this item in a different color two years ago for my son .it is not waterproof but what sheet is ? ! i recommend purchasing a size bru especially for baby brand waterproof pad to go under the sheet just like you would buy a waterproof cover for your crib mattress ! . the sheet will hold the pad in place and fit perfectly over top both the pad and mattress .this sheet is durable and launders easily .i was so pleased with this product i would purchase it again ! in fact i did ! i am expecting twins so i purchased another sheet in this color and also two of the smaller size for my two graco travel lite cribs pnp s .good job graco for coming up with yet another great product !we bought a second hand pack and play and there was no diaper caddy attached as some pack n plays offer . i ordered this fast day prime shipping and upon receiving it immediately tried it empty on the side of the pack n play . it fit and appears to be secure on the side so we can use the pack n play changing pad and have our diapering needs close by .this pad fits my arm s reach co sleeper great . i bought this to put between the mattress and sheet . the pad gives it more cushion and will absorb any leaks if they happen . i washed it and the pad washed great .
great little mixing console for home use and practice .i use it at home and sometimes take it on the road for small gigs where i need to connect my guitar a pair of cordless mics and a portable electronic drum kit .this thing has phantom power just in case you didn t read that already !overall i can say without hesitation that this unit is sturdy and packs all the necessary features you d need and even has a british eq to help shape your sound a bit .cons ? not many . . . one gripe about this unit is that it has no power button ! i mean what kinda electronic device comes without a power button these days huh ? you have to disconnect the power adapter either from the power source or from the back of the mixer in order to take the device off . apart from that the led is wayyy too bright so bright that you can t look at the device for very long and obviously can t make out the writing and control labels on the device . i notice all behringer pedals come with this bright led . what i usually do is take a piece of tape and cover the led .i recommend getting this unit and only gave it stars because of the few cons listed above .as with all boss roland products the boss fs performs as designed . i purchased it to control both my boss me multi effects pedal and my fender blues jr amp . the a switch in non latching mode allows me to cycle through stored effects banks in my me and the b switch in latching mode allows me engage and disengage the fat overdrive switch on my blues jr amp . everything works exactly as planned . the fs rugged compact fits right into my into me carrying case and easy to use .i read a few reviews where people were complaining about batteries . . .something to complain about . as with most guitar players i don t use batteries in my effects pedals i use an volt ac dc adapter . visual sound offers the one spot ac dc adapter kit that has a volt battery snap connector adapter . i removed the battery cover then using a small rat tail file i carefully cut a notch in the battery cover for the snap connector to pass through . i then put rubber feet purchased at ace hardware on the bottom to allow the snap connector cable . . .battery problem solved .i also use the fs as a sustain pedal for my yamaha ypg portable grand piano and a control for my rc loop station simultaneously . the possibilities are limited only to your imagination . it is somewhat expensive but it is a great product ! ! if you need a duel switch then i highly recommend purchasing the fs .this is a great mixer if you are looking to do simple podcasting or solo music production at home . it s a great little unit . the only set back is that you can not use condenser mics with this without an external phantom power supply as there is no phantom power on this unit . you need to get the model if you need phantom power otherwise this will work fine with regular xlr or hi z microphones .
i have these pencils and they are really cool . these pencils are colorful and cute .mostly kids and above use them .the pencils are really cool and the lead refill barrels do not come with the pencils .you have to buy the lead .these pencils overall are very cool .i write and draw for a large portion of my day and i m a pencil person . as a designer i don t use pens much . this pencil meets and exceeds all of my requirements . it s not too fat why is there a trend these days to make writing instruments so clunky and thick ? it s just right . there are small silicone bumps around the knurled metal grip making it very comfortable . there is an adjustable window where you can set what softness of lead you are using . the erasers are the standard easy to find pentel ones . i prefer . mm leads so for me pentel has hit one out of the park on this pencil . if you like writing drawing with a pencil this is a perfect choice .you need to be careful when you sharpen these pencils they will break easily if you sharpen them for too long . other than that these are perfect colored pencils for art projects .
all dogs were very skeptical and i had to chase them down to use this on them . however once i used it once i no longer had to chase them ! now i go brush and my dogs sit by me wondering if they can also have their teeth brushed ! love this !i have two of these now . one is used for fry to mature in and the other is to let guppies have babies . my guppies are fry eaters and if i didn t use this product i would have very little fry left . i have a heavily planted tank too . easy to use doesn t seem to stress females and it s big enough to let fry mature until they can be released . i recommend .i bought it for my turtle and fish and it just does not filter anything and i tested it to see if maybe i was wrong and i was not . i think i might have to rethink even having pets at all since i can not get the right equipment for them
i purchased this to be able to attach a high end hydraulic assisted bike rake on the back of my jeeps jks with the rear tire still on . it fit perfectly and teamed with the bolt lock blt receiver lock keyed specifically for your line of vehicle it can be kept in the jeep and my daughter doesn t need anything but her car key .the extender is exactly as advertised well made fit perfectly and does eactly what it is inteded for .these cruiser accessories locking fasteners import stainless are exactly what i needed to mount my plate securely to my truck . though i ordered them for my car it had no plate mount to use them on and i couldn t get up behind the plastic bumper to back up the screws with the locking nuts . nuts !very strong and adjustable cup holder . i bought two of themm skrewed them onto the rv walls . . .one for the driver and one for the passenger .
i use this when myon stage microphone inch gooseneck blackare too long for what i want to do . sometimes on rare occasions i have used this to extend the length of the model .the mic i mainly use this with is anady dm drum and instrument microphone which is small relatively light and works with saxophones as well as drums and cymbals . when i am using that mic for alto and tenor sax i use anon stage my microphone extension attachment barto clamp to the pole of a regular microphone stand and attach the gooseneck and dm without using a separate mic stand .because this and its bigger sibling are so versatile i keep a few of each size around plus a supply of extra extension attachment bars . in some situations they can be a savior during set up . i will empahsize though that anything larger than the dm or dm which is slightly larger and heavier and this may not hold your mic in place .i use this adapter on the interface mix board end of channel of my xlr cable snake to change channel into my monitor return . i plug an xlr to female stereo adapter to the other end to create a headphone jack at the musician end of my setup . now i can record with channels and monitor with . it s an channel xlr snake . why do i go through all that you ask ? because i have an channel xlr snake and instead of buying another snake why not adapt the snake i have ? hence the word adapter . . . p i love it . it s a great tool to add versatility to your setup no matter what you re doing . definately recommend this product to anyone that would happen to need to change an xlr to balanced stereo . . . it s high quality and very solid i definately expect this to last me a long time .i own both the h and h n and i love them both . the h n is a great versatile field recorder . i mainly use it to record audio for live event video such as weddings and speaking engagements . the h n is a work horse . it has a ton of features and records in a number of different formats . i highly recommend purchasing a furry head wind screen for the unit as the foam wind screen included is not for out door use .unlike the h design that has a hard protective ring around the microphones the h n leaves the microphones exposed in order to capture the purest sound possible in live and studio applications . however be aware that because of the exposed microphone design the external mics are prone to breaking off if the unit is dropped . i had this happen once . if this happens to you don t worry . i searched the internet and was able to find several zoom certified service centers within my general area . i called the closest service center spoke with a repairman and shipped the h n off and the mic was replaced under warranty i didn t pay a dime . i had it shipped off and back in days .all in all the h n is a great field recorder . i mainly use it in channel mode . chanel mode allows me to record from both external microphones as well as the two xlr inputs at the same time . in some cases i also use a small channel behringer field mixer if i have to run more than lavalier microphones . running straight from the mixer outputs to the h n works perfectly .i do suggest some accessories when using the h n . as i said earlier purchase a furry head wind screen . i use the furry head wind screens every time i record outdoors and they completely eliminate wind noise . i only use gb sandisk sd cards because sandisk is dependable i have never ever had one fail in all my years of recording . i record at k bits in .wav format which tends to create a lot of data when at live events so gbs is large enough to record over hours at that sampling rate . this allows me to keep old audio clips on the card for a while after recording them and is a safety net in case i forget to transfer the audio files along with video when i edit . i also suggest having a di box on hand in the event you may have to run a line out from someone else s mixer . i have had issues with digital clipping and over saturated sound when running a feed without a di box from venue mixers . this has to do with a balance and padding that i am just not going to get into but trust me a di box is the simplest and surest fix for these issues . i also suggest getting a small portable mixer in case you have to run more than microphones when at live events . always be prepared . i use rechargeable duracell aa batteries and i have never had any issues . battery life is between hours when the unit is left on and hours when left powered on and recording .i do not regret this purchase at all . the h n is a handy little studio on the go and is very dependable . i highly recommend purchasing one .
i love taking care of my vehicles . i have used many expensive imported products over the years . however meguiar s keeps winning me back with their incredible offerings . they are of high quality effective easy to find and affordable . however take the affordable off . i d use their products if they were x the price because i ve used products that cost that much and are less effective .meguiar s nxt generation tech wax . highlights that experience . i didn t want to like this wax sealant as much as ones i paid thirty forty or fifty dollars to buy . however the results were obvious . on my vehicles this is the best wax sealant i have ever used .for optimum results i strongly encourage you before apply nxt . clay your car clean with a paint cleaner i .e . scratch x or deep crystal step polish with a pure polish deep crystal step or show car polish and then apply this wax . the results are truly remarkable .to maintain your shine remove loose dirt and contaminants with quick exterior detailer or ultimate exterior detailer .meguiar s keeps delivering the good stuff and i m a fan .bought meguires and mothers brands . the mothers brand is a lot better . it gets the plastic trim back to black and it stays that way alot longer than the mequires brandgood cloths for cleaning autos and household items .i ve never used any sorry microfiber towels .some are more plush than others but all will do the job .generally speaking the thicker they are the longer they last and the more they will cost .for the price these cloths are good .for just cleaning our everyday drivers and two show cars i m lucky to wear out several a year .we even wash and also dry with the same cloths .show car guys all purpose microfiber towels x one of the best microfiber cleaning cloths there is . this pack of high quality all purpose microfiber terry towels can be used to clean and detail cars clean glass and kitchen appliances using n . . .and for the price you can t beat them .
i have found many uses for this product . should have bought it years ago . when you need something attached use velcro .my husband purchased this ! he said it really works great ! he keeps it at his desk at home and says he has no problem when he needs to remove stapels .this is a device always needed when working .i use them for all manner of my work in my home office . this twelve pack is such a great way to buy the sharpies if you use them a lot .
it is wonderful that there are tab dividers in this package and i love the fact that these each have the insert able labels to place each tab dividers .for the money this is an ok deal . however these are light duty type of dividers and may not last as long dividers made out of plastic . these are made out of paper and can tear if you are not careful .for dividing on a short term use or very light use these are ok .if you need to buy something more durable that will last for a long time i cannot recommend these . for me i use a set of clear plastic avery dividers with pockets . and they are a little pricey yet they are of superb quality .very well made and sturdy these are excellent dividers . the problem for me is that they are plastic . using these made me truly appreciate paper dividers . that these are more mylar than cellophane didn t really help .your mileage may varythese labels are excellent clear .pros sticky but easily removable labels are lightweight and thin labels look sleek high qualitycons labels are a bit delicate price is highif you are in need of clear labels these are a great option !
should you need to connect a condenser microphone to a phantom power box so that it will work with an ordinary amplifier or mixer without phantom supply this is a good length for the link .this is a great mixer if you are looking to do simple podcasting or solo music production at home . it s a great little unit . the only set back is that you can not use condenser mics with this without an external phantom power supply as there is no phantom power on this unit . you need to get the model if you need phantom power otherwise this will work fine with regular xlr or hi z microphones .if you want to use this to power up a tascam dr series digital recorder i have a less expensive solution for you if you own a usb wall charger like a cell phone charger you can use that to power your device through its usb port . that s a lot cheaper than spending twenty something dollars on an additional wall wart !

get the large one it s not too large but an appropriate size i would assume after receiving the large one that the small one is quite small . i have a lbs cocker spaniel mix and he loves treats . the quality is great and i have seen at pet stores at a very costly i price .love these glasses ! they are high quality and have the chin strap to hold them on ! love these glasses and my boston terrier leaves them on !he got so much attention at the local festival .ordered the small for my pound puppy he could have easily worn an xsordered the medium for my pound large boston fits him perfectly .ordered the xl for the pound pit bull that i was keeping . they were too large . he could have easily worn the large . hope this helps !overall great product ! ! ! will order again in more colors ! ! a i have a medium size dog and it s really just too big for him . if you have a great dane large golden retriever or something that likes to play tug this will be good for you . i have a sort of a beagle rotweiler looking mix and it s just too big for his jaw .
i wish there was a guide somewhere that shows you what cars these sunshades fit . i bought this one super jumbo for my toyota camry hoping it would fit . well it did not fit . i had to return it and order the regular jumbo sunshade . the regular jumbo sunshade fits the windshield like a glove . quality is good and it folds up to about . so if you have a toyota camry do not buy this one ! ! ! order the regular jumbo size .amazon can you please look into getting some sort of reference guide that will show customers the correct vehicle application ? this would make buying this product a whole lot easier .cpslooks and fits the same for a toyota sienna van . i ordered extra so i will not be without any at a later date .just recived these prefect fit would tell any one in of these to buy these you wont besorry you did
guitar string . between and . does its job for those who want strings that are easier to bend than and not as noodlely as .reduces string noise as promised . makes slides much easier to accomplish with ease and less noise . i think they also do reduce some finger soreness as your fingers aren t as irritated from sliding on bare strings . makes them feel kinda like elixirs but sounds a lot better and you still have the naked strings feel . also does make the neck a lot smoother . i will be buying more for all my guitar cases .winds your strings its durable and will cut your strings as well you can pull your pins at the bridge with it as well .
we love this sleepsack for our daughter ! she wears it every night to bed . we feel comfortable that she has something on that is like a blanket but safe . the only problem i have with it is that she grew to long for it . the only size recommendation is by weight only . according to the tag she should still fit because of her weight but she is actually too long for it now . maybe they should switch their sizing to the same weight and length recommendations as many clothing items have .these sleeps sacks are very large though my son is in the middle of the recommended weight and at the end of the height rangeit s larger than i expected but i will keep it until my son can fit into it . my son is lbs and around inches which is why i bought the large based on the weight recommendation but even the medium is quite large on him right now . would suggest using the height recommendation as a closer indicator of what size to buy rather than weight .
this bottle system is great for the oz bottles . i had no problem mixing a full bottle and the drop ins are a breeze . my only problem is with the oz . i always add the formula to the water as you re supposed to but you can t do that with the oz . i have to either used a different bottle then transfer or use something with a lid to make an oz . also be careful with the liners a box of oz drop ins i bought had several liners with holes . i called playtex and they sent me . off coupons for baby magic products not liners so it wasn t very helpful in replacing the defective ones . also if anyone has tips to make powdered formula in the oz bottles email me cjal aol .comi use these to transport bottles so no leaking . great buy ! use these with the old event rings on the new advent bottles and no leaking i bought these bottles as well as the avent bottles and i have to say these are much better than the avent bottles . my daughter got too many bubbles in her bottle with the avent bottles . the dr . browns eliminate all bubbles . she has no problems with gas when we use these bottles so i have stopped using the avent bottles all together .
the metal arms are solid so is the base but i don t know why the holes in the metal arms aren t pre drilled to accept the twist screws . it was also perplexing why the one arm was round instead of square at least the square arms have better grip traction for the crews . also mine came with no instructions and in general came very unprofessionally packed . for awhile i though i had gotten a used refurbished unit . also would be better if the wire loop hook on their deep dome lamp was wider to actually sit in the hook of the lamp stand rather then sit on top of it .i am fairly disappointed with this after being so pleased w the stand . the tent is short and most cats like stand up straight to poo . also the velcro already attached not nearly enough to do anything to the tent releases when attached to the velco pad we must attach to the stand . lastly the tent is to help keep the litter from spreading which this does not do . there are only four inch patches of velcro the rest is open for the litter to fall all around the unit . don t waste your on this accessory .nice but perhaps bigger than i need . when placed along the long side of the small aquarium i have the hook brings the light almost to the far side of the aquarium rather than near the same side as the stand . perhaps moving it to the narrow side instead and on the opposite end of the aquarium from where it s needed the arm will extend long enough so that the light will be where it s needed . but then the cord needs to be strung up more awkwardly for my setup . my problem really not the product s .the stand seems sturdy and designed well . there are clips to hold the cord but they seem to be made of a metal that isn t particularly springy so they have to be bent in just enough to grasp the cord otherwise it tends to slip out . i haven t yet figured out that perfect tension or perhaps the clips can t maintain it because of the weak metal .
there are no better battery charger maintainers than battery tenders and these wires are essential if you have multiple motorcycles like i do . just attach it to the battery terminals and plug it into your battery tender when you need to .i ordered different chargers to maintain my gate opener s deep cycle battery a simple output charger with extension cords for charging other deep cycle batteries from amazonbattery tender dl wh v bank battery management system and this unit has a far superior charging design .the bank battery tender does a simple fast rate charge then switches to a trickle charge at a constant voltage with outputs .this unit pulses the battery under charge and features operating modes with different current outputs for different sized batteries . the selections are motorcycle which also works well for sla gel cells or agm batteries standard automotive starting battery deep cycle batttery and off .what makes the ctek unit special is that it uses a pulse charge in all modes to attempt to desulphate batteries while the battery tender does not . this method of charging has proven successful in restoring lead acid batteries that won t take a charge any more .it comes with a waterproof v output cable and a set of clips or rings for permanent installation under the hood of your car . in addition to the leds for indicating the type of battery being charged a second set is provided for empty full and maintenance pulse charge mode .there is also a noticable increase in quality between the battery tender and this unit small details like a water sealed housing and gaskets on the connectors indicate quality in manufacture .for a single v lead chemistry battery this is a useful well made tool .the battery tender junior v charger comes complete with everything needed to charge your v battery . i purchased this model to specifically charge my motorcycle battery and i am pleased to say that the unit works great . it is a very compact charger and is supplied with several attachments to ensure that your battery is kept in an optimum condition .i made the permanent hard wire attachment to my battery using the color coded leads connected directly to the appropriate positive negative terminals on the battery . the opposite female end has an end cap which can cover the inlet when not in use . when i know that i will not be hitting the road for an extended period of time i simply plug the unit in to maintain my existing battery s power supply .battery tender makes larger charging units but this battery charger is great for charging everything from batteries for atv s and motorcycles to scooters and lawn mowers . because of it s very discreet size it does not take up any needed space . i would recommend this product to anyone who wants to protect their battery investment and do not want to compromise space and versatility .
i don t know why steel rules aren t more popular . the problem with plastic rules is that they can get broken or the edges get dented . steel doesn t and it lasts for ever . i have several steel rulers and they keep their edges for years .mine doesn t break or warp and it s the only ruler i use . plus i often need to cut paper with an craft knife and a steel ruler is the only kind you can use for that kind of work . spend a little more get a steel ruler and it can literally last you for ever .first off i got this ruler not to measure things but to act as a straight edge . i don t measure things with rulers i have measuring tape for that . this was the cheapest metal ruler over long that i could find and i use it to cut out straight stenciled parts mainly plastic vinyl and paper .i needed something over a foot long but not a full up yard or meter stick . i also needed something that wouldn t slide around on a smooth surface . it also had to be reasonably tough so it doesn t get nicked or cut when i put a razor blade to it . this fulfills all those points and it did it for less than . i really have no complaints .i can see what others are saying about the lines not being engraved and possibly rubbing off but quite frankly i don t care for the record though they haven t yet on mine . if you do this might not suit your needs but it works just fine if you need a cheap lightweight non slip straight guide .this tape is definitely useful in a lot of ways . picture hanging if it isn t too heavy or fragile securing items to shelves so they don t get broken i also used some to keep a shoe holder on my closet shelf from sliding . there are so many ways this can be used the limit is your imagination . keep in mind though that this isn t like command strips . . .you can and probably will lose some paint or do damage on finished surfaces when you go to remove it . as long as you re not worried about it being permanent i highly recommend it .
i use this tape for attaching to surfaces that are not smooth . . . like the dash of my car or the fabric on my cub wall . . . so far it is a permanent hold and appears to want to stay that way . but please keep in mind that this is a permanent adhesive . removal of this tape at best will leave a difficult to reove residue . mlre often it will damage the surface . . . permanet implies forever so if you use it in that manner you will be satisfied .these are standard envelopes that work just as one would expect they should . the only thing that they could have added is a tear off sticker that reveals the sealing glue . instead i have to lick the sealing glue in order to get the envelope cover to stick to the envelope body .these name badges are a real improvement over the previous series . our application is for baptisms . the name tages can be seperated from the sheet without taking off the back glue protector . the vinyle flexibility works well on any clothing can be removed without a sticky residue . thanks for the upgrade of the stick on name tag .in him dr . carl
this doesn t fit my toyota tacoma factory hitch . it needs to be . the package on this lock reads but i measured it at . i m going to have to grind the bolt .update jan . an noted i had to grind the inside ends to make this fit in my tacoma oem hitch . once it was ground to the proper length i spray painted the bolt and have used it to haul a foot trailer and attach my tow hook ever since with no further problems . jeep wrangler unlimited sahara used this to extend a bluetooth adapter to the glove box of my jeep through the dash panels . now my knee won t smash the adapter and with the plug head being shorter i don t hit this either . works just as i had planned .i purchased this belt for my chevy tahoe . i had no idea chevy would put serpentines on a newer generation vehicle . this smaller belt fits the a c system only . it works like a champ and fits perfectly . i would recommend the gatorback belts to everyone ! as an installation side note you have to remove the air intake and larger serpentine to get to this bottom of the motor mounted unit . . . . way to engineer that one gm !
hmm . . .velcro . . . .comes in a roll . . .cut to size needed . . .sticks great . . .stays on well . . .comes in a few colors . i got clear but the fuzzy part was white so it really defeats the purpose right ?this is a basic no frills tape dispenser .it s weighted so it stays in place when you need tape so it can easily be operated with one hand . the tape holder flips up so there s no parts to lose .it varies in price quite a bit so be watchful and you can get it at a great price .no complaints here . it does what it needs to .it came in a square box with minimal assembly required . in fact you just need to attach the top flat portion of the scale and you are ready to go . battery is no included so you have to provide your own type c batteries you will need . i found it hard to remove the cover of the battery compartment but nothing to fuss about . you can use an ac adapter but you will have to buy it separatelyto tell you the truth the first thing i notice is how cheap the product looks . mine came in silver i probably would prefer the black . yet there is no sure way what color you will get . what i really like about it is the simplicity of the operation its functionality and its minimalistic design . there are only buttons on the front on off hold will hold the result for minutes tare will deduct the weight of the container if you use one very useful the other adjustment is located on the right side which cycle the units in to metric and differrent amounts .one other thing that is very practical is the detacheable faceplate . if you have a big box you will most likely cover the digital display which will require you to kneel to peek the display under the box . the faceplate can be extended outward with a spiral cord like the one you see on the older type of analog telephones .display is backlit . lb capacity . made in china .
i was skeptical to say the least since i thought i needed a tape gun a huge roll etc . . . but the reviews were so good that i tried it for . what did i have to loose . it works so much better than the tape dispenser and gun i had stores away easier and the tape is a really good quality tape .i m very impressed extremely impressed due to the size and price that it works so well . this is why i rely so heavily on amazon reviews for so many purchases because they don t lie . it s real people telling honest reviews about their experience and it s one of the main reasons i shop on amazon .hope this helps ! thanksi use the same rules for binders that i use for ink reviews . . .it s a binder if it works than i have no complaints . if anything i m worried that i may need a bigger size for the multitude of readings i get as part of my grad seminar but that s a fault in my product selection rather than the actual product itself . it works for my needs and that s all i really care about .i read all these reviews and since i ve been using these white out things a lot recently for note taking i figured i d get this . i d been using the bic version of this since that was in my grocery store . anyway got this for the reviews here was excited to try it for how positive people were . it doesn t roll on as easily as the bic it makes a scraping feeling that s like the chalkboard effect strangely uncomfortable don t know what it is and it rubs off too easily . go with the bic .
replaced my beloved small clone chorus with this pedal and i m glad i did . this is one lush pedal and it s all analog . this pedal also sounds great with gain .behringer pedals are the value leader in effects pedals . i have four of them and my latest is this compressor sustainer . it is very low noise and perfect for acoustic guitar and bass when leading music in a church setting . i ve had more expensive pedals over the last years of playing but it s hard to beat the price features and quality of the behringer pedals .most the reverb selection sound identical . they all sound good . i would say that the boss reverb pedal sounds better . i use this pedal in my pedal chain . it doesn t get much action my amp has a reverb . i was looking for trippy modern hifidelity effects on my guitar .
this is my second condenser microphone and i have to say that i love it . i previously owned an audio technica condenser mic which sounded thin and not as natural to me . i noticed that this mic does not really boost any frequencies like some other mics do in this price range . with this microphone what you hear with your ears is basically what you get . of course room acoustics and microphone positioning all play a large part in the final sound .i use an alesis mic preamp with a focusrite i interface and the recordings sound clean . another thing to mention this is a variable pattern condenser mic . however even with all the polar patterns that this mic has to offer i usually just leave it on cardioid since i mainly use the m for vocals . although i usually only record vocals i also record electric guitar acoustic guitar and drums with the same microphone .overall my experience with this microphone has been pretty great . i think that for this price it will be hard to find another microphone that can perform on the same level .i bought this headphone amp for in the isolation booth of my recording studio . the idea was to give the vocalist instrumentalist personal control over their own levels without the engineer having to change any settings manually . the item works great for that as long as you re not using a powered microphone . if you are using a powered microphone you get a crazy loud buzzing and interference when the monitor and microphones are plugged in . plus the hum buzz is so loud you can t hear anything from the microphone . the only way i ve gotten rid of the buzz is by running an unbalanced mic cable from the headphone amp to a direct box and then into the board . i m told that a hum eliminator would do the trick but that s another i really wasn t planning on forking out . i d rather have the engineer change the levels for the vocalist instrumentalist than pay an extra at the moment . again it s very good at what it does if you don t power the microphone .i bought this to connect a technics tt with an audio technica cartridge to my newer onkyo receiver with no phono input . the unit did work but i had to turn the volume to out of to get any reasonable volume . in addition i have an onkyo m connected to the receiver that i use for as a zone amplifier . with this preamp i am getting some serious spikes into the amp . they are not audible but the lights would dim and the volume from the zone speakers would drop . i do not have this problem with any other source so it appears to be some signal from this preamp .this unit may work perfectly fine with a behringer mixer but for my use it doesn t meet my needs at all . i am returning it .
i didn t like the color . it was blue . i was supprised that it was not clear as most tubing is .very nice sand for my reef tank . it does not look overpoweringly pink but has more like pink undertones which is exactly what i wanted .this test has one tray with small bowls kind of like contact lens holder size but shallower . it requires taking tweezers provided and taking a tiny yellow dot and putting it in tank water adding a drop of one chemical to one of the bowls . after minutes you are supposed to compare the yellow dot s new color with a color chart . one dot didn t change and the other one was maybe a slightly lighter yellow which wasn t an option on the color chart . it was expensive and not helpful . i would return it if i could but since i actually used the product i won t try .
these are very good quality cards that can be printed for any purpose thank you invitation x mas cards etc . etc . although the box says that they are for inkjet printers i have used them in dell brother samsung laser printers without any problem .but i did need to download the template from the microsoft office web site . the template also works for iwork pages in mac just open the template from the file menu in pages . then i found out that avery has software providing templates for all its products at its web site . the software is designpro for mac and wizard for microsoft office on windows and is available for free download at avery web site . as of july each card and envelope comes to about cents a card . not bad .bottom line good product saves from running to store each time you need a different kind of card and then you can also customize the card .i wanted a small flatbed scanner to convert nearly all of my paper documents four lateral file drawers full into pdf files . i ve now scanned well over pages now with no problems . it could be a tad faster . even as it is it finishes scanning before i have the next page ready at least half of the time .i d give this scanner five stars were it not for the fact that the mac os x software included is so obviously an afterthought . the canoscan toolbox does not even have a standard ox x interface it s not win xp either it s just something else entirely . another minus is that the software which ships with the scanner is several vesions out of date and it s not as easy to find updates on canon s web site as it should be .overall however it is an excellent value .follow up the canon software is not compatible with mac os x . notwithstanding what it says on canon s software update page . when i contacted canon they basically admitted the problem and offered to sell me a newer scanner at a discount . instead of replacing the scanner i replaced the software with vuescan . i have had no problems scanning a couple of hundred pages using vuescan in mac os x . .the paper quality is good and there is a wide variety of templates to choose from on the avery web site . the templates range from wedding invitations to get well cards to office oriented announcement cards . you have to provide the actual text but the background images are part of the templates . you can also design and print your cards via their web site it generates a pdf file that you print one side at a time . helpful instructions are close by . the templates on the web site are for all versions of microsoft word i had no trouble opening them with openoffice .org software .
we have been using the black and white cards on this mobile and they easily capture my baby s attention starting at around weeks old . she is now weeks and she is obviously entertained by it with big smiles when it is moving . it places some cards in a horizontal position so that they can be viewed from below perfect for the baby s perspective . unfortunately the designs on the cards and the horizontal position for some cards are the only great things about it .only some of the cards are designed to be in the horizontal position . i had planned to swap cards between the vertical and horizontal positions to keep it interesting but this is not possible . the only change i can make is to turn over the cards in the horizontal position to reveal the design on the other side . the cards in the vertical position are not viewable from below where the baby is . i will be looking into using some tape to place the vertical cards into a horizontal position .the method used to attach the vertical cards to the plastic arms and to the horizontal cards is rudimentary and thus a pain . the vertical cards have a small triangle cut out for placing the card on the knob at the end of the arm . the triangle is small and needs some force to push the knob through . it isn t easy to do when the mobile is already set up and hanging over the crib . each horizontal card has a couple of slits that look like cracks in the center one larger than the other at right angles . a tab at the bottom of the vertical card needs to be pushed through the bigger slit and then shifted into the smaller slit . again this isn t easy to do especially when the mobile is already set up and hanging over the crib .the design of the hanging parts limits the amount of circular motion . it will only turn approximately half a circle . it would be nice if it could handle more motion than that .great designs on the cards but poor execution for a mobile .tiny love s toys are always tops in our house and the tiny fruit line is no exception . you can peel this one peek inside look in the mirror and it is just the right size and shape to promote clasping and lifting . fantastic ! ! !fantastic product . our child loves playing in this pack n play . even if we don t put toys inside the walls are moderately entertaining for our child . the sun has a mirror plastic kind that sort of warps images the butterfly has crinkly wings fabric with plastic inside for noise another side has a bug with wings inside and the final side has a squeaker which is really hard to use .it s all one piece so no assembly ever required . the sides are collapsible with the push of a button on each side . the ground mat that the child sits on servers as the exterior of the case that holds the pole assembly together when folded up . and there s a light plastic zipper bag with handle that serves as a carrying case . it packs up into a long rectangle probably x x feet .pros pack up or unpack in under a minute no assembly required just set it and lock it into place like a collapsible baby stroller . sturdy build child won t be able to tip it over and it would never fold on itself . soft but strong mesh walls that child can see through but can t stick fingers or small objects through mesh .cons this is a minor complaint the squeaker on one of the walls is impossible for a child to squeak you have to press it from both sides of the wall because it s sewn so tightly as a side effect of the sturdiness it s very heavy . on the plus side of that it is made of sturdy materials .
my dog gets tangled around this thing regardless of the swivel . . . so frustrating . i can t get it far enough in the ground to not get tangled around and i tried everything to get it in as far as possible . there is no way she would be able to get this out of the ground but because i cant get it down all the way she entangles herself . i guess i wish this was shorter . . .this works really well . the handle is comfortable . teh cats mostly enjoy the combing . i catch many fleas with it . teh teeth are far enough apart that many fleas get caught in between which allows me to catch them and drown them . when it picks them up they more frequently jump and get away .i can throw my dog s ball way farther using this wearing her out way faster and i never have to pick up a gross slobbery ball . what more could you want . get one .
reads the temp in c or f and seems accurate .it does what it is meant to do and does it very wellfantastic product but it is somewhat leaky at the t connector in the sink . it does what it claims and does it well . if it was not somewhat leaky it would have been perfect .this piping works great . it does everything its supposed to do . fits nicely on my air pump and my aerating stone .
if you need a calculator that prints this is not the calculator for you . however if you need a handy sized easy to read solar calculator . . .this is a good one . it does everything that i want a calculator to do at work . it can figure . i never use these features but it can figure tax rates and has memory mrc m m . the buttons are big enough . i would buy this model again .i know there is a calculator on my computer but i still love regular calculators and this one is a convenient compact size . since this is dual powered it will last longer and you can recharge it with solar power .the size of this calculator is nice because it fits in your hand while you calculate away . i find i make less mistakes although i do sort of miss my calculator with the larger key pad . the rebecca reviewthese are the same normal size as all my other standard highlighters not stubby or mini in any respect .they were delivered quickly saving me gas and time in line shopping at a great price . i prefer the flourescent to the yellow because they do not obscure the text when i need to photocopy .i can t comment on how long they last yet but noted nothing adverse in the other reviews .great product . great price .
i use a lot of x notepads . i keep one on my computer table at home for taking notes doodling whatever and i go through pads a month . the tops pads are as good or better than the pads i used to buy at office supply stores . the nearest office supply store is several miles from home and it s easier and more economical to buy the tops pads from amazon with free prime shipping .update november i ve just received my third order of these pads and i m still very pleased with them .i happenned across these post its on amazon just when i needed some . ordered them received them with amazon prime before i could ve made it to a store they probably cost less .boy was i ever tickled when these guys finally arrived in the mail ! since i sell online i was needing something more substantial than just an . x sheet of paper attached to the box for the address information . and of course amazon sends me these labels and my problems are over ! i can reuse boxes that i ve received previously since these labels do an outstanding job of covering any old labels or information that may be on the package from the previous shipment . they re especially great if you return a lot of items to qvc too !great label great price too . highly highly recommend !
although the reviews were mixed i was really really hoping this was going to work for me since i live in an apartment and i am the only tenant with a dog . my dog s barking is driving me crazy and i m sure it s annoying my neighbors as well . anyway the lentek arrived today and i plugged it in immediately . the noise emitted did cause my dog to stop barking but the device is so sensitive that the noise was being sent out whether my dog was barking or not . i know this because i initially had it set on audible to make sure it would be activated when my dog barked . it was set on low sensitivity . i don t see how this could be effective if the alarm is going off non stop even when my dog is not barking . . . how is that going to train him not to bark ? i ll be returning this asap .well i actually had to go through quite some trouble to get this filter delivered to me but it finally came . the setup was quite simple and i followed the instructions . everything was assembled fairly quickly and easy but for some reason my package didn t come with a level . so far i m pleased with the power of the filtration and the overall look . for the first few hours this filter was very quite and i couldn t even tell it was running . i went to the grocery store to buy some stuff and when i came back i noticed it was making more noise then before . i searched on youtube to see if anybody else is having the same issue and it seems people are . a lot of people say it s the propeller in the motor that causes a rattling noise . i m not one to complain about the noise because i ve had louder filters before but i expected this one to be as nice and quite as when i first installed it . i m not going to lie though after a while or at least at night when i m trying to go the bed seeing as my tank is in the same room i sleep in the noise gets a bit annoying . i m seeing on youtube that the only fix is to take off the motor and lubricate the propeller . i m going to have to remove the motor eventually to clean it out but i just find it a bit tedious to have to grease the impeller every now and then so it doesn t make that damn noise . i ve read some people say that after a while the filter will settle down and break in and stop making so much noise i really hope that s the case . if not then i might have to keep this filter for as long as i can and then look to replace it with something else . it sucks that i had to go through so much trouble to get this filter hoping that it would be the perfect product but sadly it felt short . i will make an update if things get better but if not then this will be my final word . the product looks good and is assembled with ease and runs at a decent price but it has a noise issue well at least for me . i wouldn t say steer away from this filter but just know that you might encounter the same problem . i really had high hopes for this filter so maybe its my fault for expecting it to be flawless but for now i just have to deal with it until i find a solution . update i used the vaseline trick and it seemed to make a major difference the rattling noise isn t as loud anymore . it s not to say that the noise is completely gone because it s not but i can say it s been minimized to a nice hum . i don t know how long this fix will last i m pretty sure it s only temporary and i will probably need to lubricate the impeller shaft eventually . for those of you who are having the same issue just type aquaclear noise in the youtube search bar and you will find a few videos showing you how to do it . so good luck to all of you who decide to purchase this filter and for those who have the rattling noise note that there is a fix for it so don t give up .i don t know how much you can talk about a cartridge for a biofilter but these work and did not make my fish sick . i don t actually know if taht has ever happened but my water quality is fantastic and i m running brackish with these .
i ordered these pens on jan th they finally arrived on jan that is days later . ok i will give them that . but my gripe is this tnt deals inc shipped them out on the th via ups with instructions to deliver the package to the post office instead of my physical address . this considerably delayed the delivery of the pens . they arrived at the post office on january and finally got to me on jan rd . that is days via ups and days at the post office . if it had gone straight from ups to me i would have had the pens on the th at the latest . why they had ups take the package to the post office is beyond me . not only that but it was poorly packaged in a floppy plastic envelope that was torn and taped together . luckily nothing was damaged because when i ordered boxes tnt shipped of those plastic packs of pens . immediate storage problem for me . i will not buy from this seller again .my order came from the witz and sons fulfilled by amazon .i ve bought hp ink through amazon for years and never once had an issue . this time what i received was questionable .the product is advertised as being in retail packaging and the photo shows an hp package .however when i opened the amazon box what was inside was not in an hp retail box . instead the ink cartridge arrived unboxed . there was no hp cardboard box . it arrived in only the hp inner foil package . that means there was no hp box no upc and of course no explicit expiration date listed .the only thing on the package outside of the hp logo is a foil code . in my case the foil code is sg . i happen to be familiar with the codes on hp foil so reading the two sets of six numbers in yymmdd format i was able to see that what i was sent had an ink warranty that expired about months ago back in august and was produced in february of .while many people use ink past the warranty date that should be the choice of the consumer . here it seems likely the seller removed the box to try to pass off a old product as fresh which is deceitful at best .this package of bright copy printer paper arrived promptly and was reasonably priced . i erred in purchasing just one package instead of a whole box oops !
works perfectly . nice feel to it and seems sturdy . you just have to remember not to turn on the keyboard with your foot down otherwise it switches polarity and does the opposite of what you want it to .this switch does work but you should look before you leap . the switch travel is greater than it is for a standard way switch and if you use the common fender replacement control plate or one that was only intended for a way switch it may not fit . you could fairly easily alter the plate but if you want the cleanest look possible you may want to investigate a new control plate .this jewel does give a vox ac tone depending how its used . for direct recording it does . if used with an amp maybe . but however you use it it is sweet .
i realize that there are testimonials for this product actually doing what it says it will do . i have not had an occasion to need it in an emergency . and i hope that i never do . it does not inspire confidence . it feels like something that would be included in a child s toy tool set . extremely lightweight . directions state you must hit the window in a specific location good luck with that in an emergency . i was hoping for a tool with enough weight which added to acceleration would break the window . again i have not used it and i will not trust it in an emergency so i will be looking for a better product . i do not recommend this item . . .at any cost .these seem to be very good quality spreaders . i am going to buy another set to have on hand in case i need them .i haven t used them yet but they look good and it will do what i need . i need to wash my car i guess
i just purchased a jeep wrangler unlimited and purchased the rugged ridge . black windshield pillar rear side grab handles for the back seat and the rugged ridge . ultimate black grab handle for cj jeep and wrangler for the front seat both of which compliment each other and fit nicely in my new jeep . i couldn t be happier with the look style quality and most importantly the strength of the handles . i m one step closer to off roading thanks to rugged ridge ! ! !it locks and unlocks well with a positive engagement feel when it is secure . fits great for both my front bumper receiver and rear receiver on my dodge ram . no complaints and i d definitely buy it again .i would install this on your jeep as soon as you purchase the vehicle . they re very easy to install and protect you from scratches that could lead to rust . the guards fit perfectly on my jeep rubicon door .
i needed a few extra shields valves and membranes . this came as an all on one set . i love that it doesnt breakdown in pieces and it is simple to use . perfect .i have three avent bottles but sealing discs didn t come with them . these are great and serve my needs well to be able to have a bottle that will travel well .i love these bottles . my breastfed baby goes back and forth between the breast and the bottle so easily with these . they are super easy to clean because they come completely apart the bottom comes off and they don t leak . the shape is great for holding and the colors are nice and generic .highly recommended !
i love that it adjusts to three different hights once fastened to a chair and that the tray can come off and my son can eat with us at the table instead of on the side of the table like he had to in his old highchair . i also like how its portable and the tray can be cleaned easily in the sink and isn t too big to stack with the rest of my dishes .this is a great chair once baby is able to sit up it doesn t recline at all so i don t recommend it for babies who aren t sitting yet .this booster is exactly what i was looking for to save space in my eat in kitchen and to have for outings to restaurants since i m not a fan of those wood high chairs most places have with the broken seat belts . this booster folds into a nice compact square for transporting . the chair secures to most common dining chairs not ideal for booths . there is also the option of raising or lower the legs beneath to help get the right height for the table so baby is part of the family . you can adjust it so baby is sitting right up to the table with no trays at all just using the lap belt but our baby likes to kick and i bet he could kick against the table and knock the whole chair over if he tried so we don t use it that way when he is older we will most likely use it in this manner as more of a traditional booster .the three trays you see in the pictures really are nice . the white tray insert fits snuggly and can be removed and placed right into the dishwasher so i use it with the insert most of the time . the blue tray is harder to fit in the dishwasher but is great for cheerios or playing with toys especially when i am trying to cook and the baby really wants to be able to see me i just pop him in and place some cheerios on the tray and he keeps himself entertained trying to get them . the green tray cover is great for keeping trays sterile while transporting the chair to a restaurant when eating out and for keeping the mess contained on the way home so you don t end up with sweet potatoes all over your car .a final bonus of this chair is that there are no real nooks for food to sneak into . this is a hard plastic without a lot of seams allowing for easy clean up with a damp cloth .the tiny diner portable placemat is a rubber mat that includes a crumb spill tray to bridge the gap between the table and your little one . it secures to the table with suction cups that work with many surfaces .the mat is made of a high quality material that should stand up to lots of use for years to come . it cleans up easily either in the sink at home i also called the manufacturer and found out that it s dishwasher safe in the top rack or else with wipes on the go . it will protect your table at home from knicks and scratches from banging utensils and dropped cups . it minimizes the mess all around with a lip on its border that trips minor spills and a deep tray that hangs over the edge of the table protecting your baby s lap . this last feature is a must have during the independent phase of learning how to use forks and spoons .away from home it s a great way to let your child eat according to his or her home routine . it also protects him or her from germs on the table . the only drawback is in the transportation . the mat is a little like a roadmap you ll never get it folded back as nicely as when it first arrived . as a result it can take up a lot of space in a small daytime afternoon diaper bag .judging from other reviews it seems that this is yet another in the long list of love it or hate it items that are subject to your child s tastes . based on our experience the tiny diner is certainly worth a try for its low price if you can get your toddler used to using it it will become invaluable .pros traps all sort of crumbs and spills including a tray between table and baby protects your table from bumps and scratches durable i can t imagine it wearing out easy to clean and maintaincons doesn t fold up very well
i prefer the ventaire bottles with the wider nipple bases . these nipple bases are really narrow . if you are looking for nipples that are likely better for breastfed babies i would go with the wider nipples . because of the difference obviously the tops are not interchangeable but the bases between the wider bottles and these thinner bottles are interchangeable . these are easy to use and wash they make my baby less gassy and she can hold the bottle if i need her to . i still prefer the wider bottles though since she is generally breastfed . i have switched to ventaire bottles over the drop ins tommy tippee and avent bottles because i like these the best .i bought these bottles as well as the avent bottles and i have to say these are much better than the avent bottles . my daughter got too many bubbles in her bottle with the avent bottles . the dr . browns eliminate all bubbles . she has no problems with gas when we use these bottles so i have stopped using the avent bottles all together .last year in preparation to our son s arrival we bought several leading what i will call bottle feeding systems you are not buying just bottles but also committing yourself to the accessories specific to that brand so they are systems . the ones we chose to try were dr . brown s bpa free polypropylene natural flow wide neck bottle philips avent bpa free classic bottles theseplaytex although in concept very appealing we did not like because due to their design material it is hard to get out all of the milk and so some of it always gets wasted . also it is very challenging to measure out exact amounts as the numbers and gradations on the dropins is hard to see . we stopped using these very quickly . although if you are using formula that is less viscous than milk these might be work much better . plus target sells a store version of dropins which a lot of people like so that helps a lot with the price .avent bottles are generally very good and we ended up using them a lot . also we purchased the ridiculesly overpricedphilips avent bpa free standard breast pump conversion kitto be able to use the bottles withmedela pump in style advanced breast pump . the setup works great . the main problem with the avent bottles is that if you forget to put in the little ring the milk will leak all over your child . with the ring in we never had a leak . we have used both the larger and smaller bottles and nipples n and the above comments apply to all variations .dr . brown s bottles are probably the best out of the three . like the avent we have used both the larger and smaller bottles and nipples . with its design it is harder to assemble the bottle without all the necessary pieces . we have never had these bottles leak . the complaints that they are hard to wash are unfounded . we never had an issue with just throwing them in the dishwasher . after about nine months of use some of the markings are slightly coming off not a big deal . also the number of parts vs avent s counting the lid is not as overwhelming as some people on here claim .there seem to be no difference in any of the above bottles when it came to reducing gas . all of them reduced some but not all . likewise our son had no preference in the nipples from one bottle to the next among these although he absolutely hatedthe first years pack breastflow bottle so we only tried it once .if i had to pick only one of the above brands it would be dr . brown s .
this is an amazing amp . it works great a lot of power a little bit heavy for it s size but it is simply a beauty . i play a godin a ultra and the the sound of this amp is so clean that i can play my acoustic and my electric trough this amp and both sounds perfect . even the acoustic sound is majestic . this amp adapts to any need you have from the cleanest sound to the heaviest distorted sound .as a musician i wanted both a pa and an instrument amp but i also wanted extra inputs and outputs . this has it all . whether you want to output to a pa or from a pa . . . . . . to your guitar amp or from it . . . . .and even play your mp player while you play and sing . if you need more inputs then just output a mixer to it . the tone controls are nice and the bass you can get is quite amazing for a . speaker . link to a bass amp or sub woofer and you definitely have full sound . certainly loud enough for a man band gig and definitely enough to supply an outdoor party with some music . i know it s a copy of other speaker amps . . . but its a behringer . i think it s a wonderful and adequate must have for any musician .takes you hours to play around with all the sounds . built in tuner and added foot switch makes it good for stage . nice and loud in a small package .
at this price tag the folder is really a bargain . i find it very useful to carry my documents around . the folder is made of hard paper which is recyclable as advertised . it is also very light weight . i am really happy with it . would recommend this folder to my friends .it s exactly what i was looking for . i love the no glare matte and they re pretty durable as well . also a plus they have box tops on them .this is a nice quality paper that works flawlessly on my color laser . it is think enough to feel like very nice quality paper a bright white but not too thick as if to feel cumbersome .overall i always feel like i m spoiling myself using this fancy paper and yet . . . its price makes it easy to do .

it does what it advertises but i mounted between two x inside the wall so it s harder to just pry it from the wall used long deck screws . as it is good whack with a hammer at it s flying of the wall .i love office supplies and anything that gets those lose papers off of my tables and counters . this corkboard is a perfect solution for items that i want to save but don t want to deal with right away .my last corkboard was actually made of cork whereas this high density cork fiberboard seems to be some time of manufactured cork that doesn t show pin holes . time will tell how well it holds up .this also came with two little plastic pieces called quick clips which slide into the frame and can hold papers . the most interesting thing about this corkboard was the fastening brackets .it comes with four large screws anchors and brackets . i had to read the directions twice before the measuring instructions sunk in . you can use the top and bottom edges of the board to create a line . then align the line on the bracket with the lines on the wall and make a circle or mark where you want to drill .then drill the anchor holes attach the brackets and snap in the board . it actually worked . attach the bottom brackets first before measuring and attaching the top brackets . if you follow the instructions this board will be flush with the wall and very stable . this is a nice product .the quartet prestige colored cork board is a great standard bulletin board .the board itself is x feet in size and comes with all the hardware needed to install it . the board was packed well and there were no defects on inspection . the cork board is a neutral mid range black brown variety . as such it would fit in nicely with either dark or light wood furniture . the frame is what they call a graphite finish but the sides look more dark brown to me and the top and bottom are somewhat more grey . on the whole the board has a very professional appearance .this is a pretty standard installation nothing terribly difficult but it does take some careful measuring to make sure that the board is level . to install this you will need a light duty drill and a screwdriver . basically four identical anchors are placed in the wall . these are flat pieces with an edge curl to fit into grooves at the top and bottom of the board . you line them up to fit in a groove at the bottom an the top of the board . i anchored the bottom two firmly . the top two were reasonably tight but loose enough to move the anchor up and down there is a slot on each anchor for the screw not just a hole . you place the bottom of the board onto the anchors then fit the top ones in place . my first impression was that this would not be a strong enough way to anchor the board to the wall but the board seems rock solid and stays in place .the cork board works well with the usual pins and is considered self healing . on the whole the self healing which seems to be true as the holes form an average size pin seem to disappear when you remove the pin . the board works well although as you push pins into the center of the board you can feel a little bit of give as you push . so far this has not posed any problems .generally this is a handsome serviceable cork board that would work well in either the home or office . recommended .
have not used this cartridge so i am not rating this re manufactured ink cartridge for its print quality . my rating reflects my dissatisfaction with this vendors deceptive advertising . this vendor is selling re manufactured cartridges and most people wouldn t know it by looking at the items web page . what i have learned if the item description doesn t say oem it isn t an epson manufactured ink cartridge . i think if a vendor is selling re manufactured ink cartridges it should be in the item description ! some will say the price should tell you it is not oem but a lot of vendors list a low price to draw customers and then recoup there losses with an elevated shipping cost !you have to be careful here . the picture shows the original brother cartridge but it says brother lc inobella . what does inobella mean ? it means its not oem and will be cheaper most likely but wont last as long . don t order off the ads that come in email go on amazon site and type in the product you want .i do not recommend the refurbished as reviews show most people don t . bite the bullet pay the to costly price in my opinion star they work well .
 fuzzy wuzzy s summary highly recommended with warm fuzzies !packaging style appearance excellent fuzzies ratingconstruction build quality excellent fuzzies ratingcompetitive pricing value average not good not bad fuzzies rating positives high build quality with good welds and smooth semi gloss black enamel coating . strong steel tubular legs can support up to pounds . if you use this as a laptop riser stand by placing a laptop on the top shelf the surface is perforated with many holes to allow for great air circulation and heat dissipation . negatives there are no negatives with this product this is an excellent solidly built steel stand that both looks attractive with its uniform semi gloss black enamel coating and can support a large computer display monitor or any other item weighing up to pounds . you can either place this on your desk or on a table or countertop e .g . some people have a computer in their kitchen to organize your computer laptop keyboard display layout better .this monitor stand weighs . pounds and has outer dimensions of . width x . depth x . height . the top shelf has surface dimensions of . width x . depth . the space underneath the shelf is . wide which is the . outer width minus the width of the two tubular legs . the space underneath the shelf has a usable height of . which is the . outer height minus the height of the tubular metal that supports the top shelf .even though this is advertised as a monitor stand i am using this as a laptop stand placing a inch laptop on top of the shelf . my computer desk already has a raised shelf where my two display monitors are positioned and my desk has an adjustable keyboard tray where my keyboard and mouse reside . i have multiple desktop and laptop computers so sometimes i place one laptop underneath this stand s shelf with its lid closed and a vga cable connecting that laptop to a larger monitor and another inch laptop sits on the top shelf of this stand . when placing a laptop on this stand where i use a separate bluetooth keyboard instead of the laptop s own keyboard the stand s perforated metal surface functions like a ventilated platform to help cool the laptop . since many laptops have their fan intake vents located underneath the laptop it is advantageous that this stand s shelf surface is a perforated metal grill to allow for great air circulation all along the bottom of the laptop . most of the other laptop riser stands are either made of flimsy plastic or metal mesh that is too thin with too much flex in the structure .but regardless of whether you need to place a large display monitor a large laptop or other item this stand serves as a simple sturdy and modern looking support .measure carefully because i did not . yes the outside measurement of the stand is inches but my laptop is also inches so rather than sitting on the desk below my monitor it sits on the legs of the stand . this means i need to be very careful with the docking station so it seats in properly . but the stand looks nice and will do for now .this unit folds up so small and flat that i love it for taking to presentations . the only caution i have is that it can get wobbly if you extend the legs to full length and the weight is not centered on the table . the legs store on the underside of the table and allows for a very compact table for a projector .
this is an incredible scanner and seems built very very well . i know this will last for a long time just like all the epson equipment i ve had in the past .installation was a breeze no problems at all . just make sure to follow the instructions and install the software before connecting and powering on the scanner . i m running windows xp on a laptop with a dock and it took all of seconds for the scanner to be ready on my machine once i powered the scanner on . very fast and easy .the scanning software is very easy to use . you can scan using auto mode home mode or professional mode each mode giving you more options to choose in your scanning .i tried all three scanning modes and i got beautiful scans with the auto mode so i didn t fret about having to select a bunch of different options when scanning . but i also liked using the advanced modes and getting different looks to my scanned materials . there s a great preview button that lets you view the options selected so you can quickly change an option if you don t like it .the scanning plate for negatives is easy to use and the scans came out wonderful ! i love seeing my old pictures again ! and it s wonderful that i can save the ones i want and delete the scanned items i don t want . no more wasting time figuring out which negatives i should get made into photos . and no more wasting money going to the mall to get photos made out of my negatives !i have my electrical phones and cellular in the house . however here in miami we do get serious storms and hurricanes during which time electrical phones do not function . therefore i have now this extra unit connected to my printer scanner which i use while sitting at my pc and should we have a hurricane can transfer to my bedroom for regular communications . you will be surprised how many time the phone lines do not go down but you cannot use the other phones because there is no electricity ! great deal . only wish it had lights on the buttons which i believe is supposed to have but i don t see them at least on mine .while i don t have an mba it s hard to believe that a calculator i learned how to use in during undergraduate business courses is still the standard for the quick calculating financial world . any finance professional over will know how to use this and in a pinch you might need to know how to use it . i know the ti x series has financial functions and the graphic capabilities may make those calculators worthwhile . but for most financial pros if it can t be done on an hp c then you probably need a computer .the rpn system isn t hard to learn at a basic level it works similar to an adding machine and the functions on this calculator take input and spit out output in a way similar to excel i .e . negative numbers for payments and positive for future value etc . . i found mine the other day after not using it for a while and immediately used it for a discounted cash flow quick analysis i was later planning to do in excel . it told me the on the fly answer i needed .
works wellthough amazon stated this cap would not fit my ford e chassis for a jayco class c greyhawk rv i ordered it anyway as it fits many other years of ford trucks and looks the same . it is rare for the same vehcle to change a design like that . it in fact fits perfectly . our rv gas filler has no cover not that that is a deterrant and gallons is a target for remote theft of gas or a target for vandalism . this cap fits well . i have not been able to fit the stock cap retainer onto it yet . i understand these modern vehicles have anti siphon plugs but one can still end up with foreign substances in the exposed fill tube . this is a good ounce of prevention .highly recommended .very well constructed but it has a design flaw that makes it useless . the internal plunger has a disc with a slot and the t handle needs to engage the disc perfectly or the rod pushes into the grease and not the disc so the grease does not load properly . i have other standard grease guns and these work perfectly but i wanted the pistol grip so i could pump with one hand .i have not idea what the intended purpose is in having the rod disengage from the plunger disc as this is unique in my experience to the lincoln grease gun .
i wish there was a guide somewhere that shows you what cars these sunshades fit . i bought this one super jumbo for my toyota camry hoping it would fit . well it did not fit . i had to return it and order the regular jumbo sunshade . the regular jumbo sunshade fits the windshield like a glove . quality is good and it folds up to about . so if you have a toyota camry do not buy this one ! ! ! order the regular jumbo size .amazon can you please look into getting some sort of reference guide that will show customers the correct vehicle application ? this would make buying this product a whole lot easier .cpsworks great . fairly easy swap . just be aware the front window regulators are the same on whether you have a suburban or tahoe or one of their gm family members . not so for the rear regulators . the full size suvs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones . the vehicle input feature amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference . the pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at but the vehicle id feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit . beware ! ! ! ! just so you know the dorman and fit the full size and the and fit the tahoe size vehicles .they do work . exactly as advertised . hane no fear on buying these . fit the chevy silverado wt tailgate rods .
i ve been using a dymo labelwriter twin turbo for about three years . i accidentally plugged in the wrong type of ac adapter into my usb hub and poof my printer blew out . so i ordered a new one . i can tell you that for a small home office environment and postage printing this printer will do the trick . the latest software synchronizes with your outlook contacts so it is easy breezy to create address labels for those who are in your outlook address book .i just received my replacement and there s a problem with the installation at least for windows . the disk that comes with the printer installs the software addressing stamps but does not install the driver . if you buy this printer and are running windows here s what you need to do go to dymo s website . . . and click on support drivers downloads . from here you can download the latest software and drivers and you ll be good to go . if this is a first time installation don t plug in the usb printer cable until prompted to do so by the software download .so aside from the installation problem this is a printer you can count on for the long haul provided you don t do something stupid like i did and blow it out with an incorrect ac adapter . lol !dymo s website has a software download for intel power macs this software does not work at all even though the mac sees the dymo sitting on a usb port it cannot print to it after a friendly geek struggled with it for the better part of a hour it finally decided to print labels even the geek does not know what he did to make it print so if it goes down it goes to my physical trash bin get with it dymo macs are taking over the computer worldexcellent printer terrible software .the included editing software is barely usable . you cannot cut and paste text from another application into your labels .text will usually printout lower than what a shown in the editor . a job that looks perfect on your display using print preview will look different when actually printed . be prepared for lots of wasted tape .i have the latest software from brother . c which only shows compatibility with older obsolete operating systems .if you want to use the printer stand alone you will probably be happy . the included editing software reminds me of mac os or windows . 
solid music stand made of heavy metal poles and solid metal music holder . the joints that you tighten are made of a heav plastic material . if anything were to give out from use it would be the plastic parts . right now in brand new condition everything fits well and grips solidly to hold poles in place . arrived a day erly .this product has an extremely flimsy spring mechanism inside . upon receiving mine and assembling it it broke immediately while i was trying to mount an ipad onto it . it also has a fairly narrow angle of adjustability . the metal parts of it seemed sturdy enough but the plastic parts looked and felt brittle .i have of these hanging on my wall with different types of guitars banjos and mandolins .they attach to the wall with screws . hardware is included to attach those screws to drywall . it takes about a inch hole in the drywall where a large screw shaped plastic piece is inserted into the drywall and then the regular screws go into the plastic .the piece that touches the guitar has some sort of silicone rubber which protects the instrument . the holder can be bent in or out a bit to better fit the instrument that you have .i have moved a couple of times and these can be removed and attached again .very sturdy well made product .
i bought this at babies r us . it did not fit my rail . it says it fits most standard rails but doesn t give any measurements . how are you supposed to know if it will fit unless you purchase it ? what a pain .what can i say about a potty seat . it fits his butt fits it he likes the characters on it it s easy to clean . buy it .this car seat base does not work with graco snugride seats . just make sure you order the correct one .
i got this to keep on one of our dining chairs permanently until our son is old enough to sit on a regular chair . our table is black with tan cushions and this chair looks great with it because it blends with the colors perfectly . and it has different height options which we currently have on the highest setting so we have plenty of room to grow in it . for reference my son is probably about inches tall .i m so glad we got this instead of a high chair . it does occupy a chair but we rarely have a shortage of chairs at our house . it is secure . at months old my son can climb in and out of it himself . we ve had this since he was a newborn . he could sit in it at around months old . he could clip the clips at around months and that was a big accomplishment . it s a great design and attaches very well to our wood dining room chair . it s easy to clean . there is a space between the booster seat and dining room chair that i always forget to clean but our dog has a long tongue .it s easy to pack around and so nice to have at restaurants so we don t have to put our son in the icky high chairs caked with ancient boogers .we got this bath for our newborn . unfortunately we weren t able to use it until very recently when she turned m .o . the issue is that the triangle stopper is very wide on newborn side and my girl was crying when we put her in this tub . even now she prefers to lay her legs on top of the stopper not around .so for the first months we used the infant bath seat made by the same company that was absolutely great . and the stopper in this seat is much narrower and much more comfortable for a baby .
i ve used these for more than two years but recently shifted to its big brother the jazz xl . same thickness and feel tone but in a larger form factor . i would definitely recommend the xl version if rhythm lead work is required . for strictly solo work with easy to achieve pinch harmonics this one is better .this is a pretty good stand for the price i ended up leaving this one in the rehearsal room as i prefer the telescoping booms . i have the dr . pro telescoping and a samson telscoping the samson is my favorite think the model is bt . for the price this is a good value .you can t beat these for the price . i use them on of my guitars scale baritones in a and b and a . standard scale in c i got a pack elsewhere for under bucks a set . they sound really good . no breakage problems etc .
great tool . the new grip is comfortable . the length is perfect . the ball does is average but any tennis ball works fine .the ball is heavier for distance throwing and the rubber is thicker . any dog with strong bite will split the ball .highly recommend the kong squeaker inch tennis ball as replacement . goes as far and is alot stronger !too bad can not buy launcher only ball is a waste of moneythe chuck it has three things going for it . first your dog recognizes the thrower and immediately goes into play mode . two you get great leverage and can give your dog more exercise without getting bursitis in your shoulder . third you don t have to pick up sloppy balls . and a fourth advantage my dog is very snobbish and will only retrieve the chuck it rubber balls . no tennis balls sticks or anything else . the rubber chuck it balls offer the right chewynish or something . she will chase other balls but then turns off or swims away when she realizes its not her only favorite orange ball .
they fit my aquaclear . it s a snug fit but they fit . great for extending the intake tube as far down as possible .my golden fits balls in her mouth so she doesn t have to give any back for me to chuck again . with this she can fit but the front one keeps falling out and give me a chance to pick up and chuck again . great size and so sturdy .our dog doesn t want anything to do with this . he is a little pup so maybe he will grow into it .
good product if you want to protect car seat from any accents . it is cheap comparing with other products on the market but at the same time good quality .nice product but just as easy to buy the generic store brand at a cheaper price .i bought this hamper because of the price . the bellissimo line has the same hamper for like double the price . this hamper is nice and very affordable i highly recommend it .
works as advertised . the labels do warp a bit with age but this does not affect how they print or attach .its a printer cartridge and it prints . they seem to last well too in terms of how many copies . the canon original manufacturer cartridges seem never to have any of the problems that the remanufactured cartridges do .this was like hitting the lottary . i love my hp officejet all in one . but ink is expensive for any printer . the price on this was was very low . it s new in the original box and seems as though it has not been tampered with . how does that man say it on the soccer announce . goooooaaaaaalllll ! ! !
i bought these mics to fit a shure mic and a gls mic and it doesn t fit either . a little too small .this strap is not a bad one but it just did not fit my guitar so that is the only problem . i have a classical guitar and sadly this strap does not fit it .does not work for all guitars . one of my guitars has a more rounded head and it does not fit over that anyway i have tried . though with the arrow shaped holders it works as it should
motion pro cable luberthe latest version of this tool has two thumb screws .i purchased this tool because it was recommended as a basic tool for maintaining your motorcycle or any other vehicle device that uses cables . well after talking to some experienced riders they all exclaimed that lubricating the cable clutch or throttle is a good idea but they generally have never done this in over years . looking at the latest motorcycles the cables don t really allow you to lubricate them using this tool or any tool for that matter . on my ducati there are rubber boots that prevent you from injecting lube into the sheath assuming you can use the tool and reach the sheath . on my ford the throttle cable sheath isn t thick enough to form a tight seal with the motion pro tool . it almost seems like the oems don t want you to lubricate the cables . on top of it modern cars and the latest motorcycles use drive by wire which is totally electronic where your throttle input pedal or twist grip is connected to a potentiometer that tells the computer your desired throttle angle input and it activates a stepper motor that opens closes the throttle plates accordingly . so if you re interested in maintaining your new bike or car with this tool you might want to reconsider buying the tool .if you have a vehicle that uses cables and has a sheath that is accessible and large enough to form a seal this tool is very easy to use and well made . just slide the cable through the slit push the tool up against the sheath entrance clamp down the screws and insert your lubricant nozzle tube into the open port . then use rags to seal the tool and the exit of the cable sheath and squirt away .overall stars the rubber seal could have been designed to accommodate really skinny cable sheaths . newer bikes and cars don t need can t use this tool .i love the simplicity and reliability of this unit . it comes with alligator clips and o ring clips to hardwire to something like my atv . i hardwired the connector to the quad so all i need to do it connect and disconnect the quick connect clips .fabulous unit compact quiet powerful and not too heavy . i cut off the alligator clamps and wired it to a way trailer connector so that i can plug it in to the rear of my truck . v is only present when the truck is running so this is a foolproof setup . i like the duty cycle although i do not expect that to be an issue .
i have a bunch of these in various models v v and this one the multi mode v . they really do a good job .reasons i don t give a star i have had of them go belly up . one the company replaced free i have not bothered on the other two yet .the supplied hard wired harness has a inappropriately short cord before the connector . edit the hardwired lugs to attach to the battery are also not appropriate many cars especially older ones as the hole is about right for a motorcycle battery . making my own harnesses for making the unit hard wired to the battery was a bit time consuming but they turn out well just fyi don t expect to just bolt it on your standard battery clamp . its way too small . the cig lighter if your car has a permanently connected one is probably easier but new cars sometimes control this with key . oh two more comments . it doesn t come with a cig lighter attachment its optional and . the optional hard wire hookup does have larger lugs on it if you are wiring into a motorcycle it might just be long enough but for my car applications i have always had to make my own harness extensions which is time consuming to get the wires all soldered shrink wrapped .it does come with a nice little case .having separate small battery mode and agm mode is nice although the paperwork on the basic ones mentioned they would charge agm . agm just takes a slower charge rate than lead acid apparently as it heats up . i am not sure what they claim the agm mode is but nice to have it .real nice battery tender tail which comes with maxi fuse and standard tender coupling .as you may see from the current amazon product picture the battery connectors are circular and enclosed so i chose to snip off about off them to make the connectors c shaped so i could slot them onto the battery bolts which taking them completely out . i just used a pair of wire cutters snip snip which took two seconds .and once connected to the battery the tail worked fine with my existing tender . very happy with product and price .i use this cable with my solar kit and am very happy with the durable construction . i use a small solar panel to charge up my deep cell battery and then attach these clamps to the positive and negative posts . voila an instant dc power socket .i also use these clamps on my car battery when i want to get the most watt power for electronic devices . when paired with a small usb inverter i can get the full watts from it instead of the watts available through my cigarette lighter .the cables are of middle thickness but are smooth and well constructed . the clamps are secure when attached to battery posts and easy to remove . the length is a bit on the spare side but i understand that these cables cannot be too long and still provide useful electrical juice . i m pleased with this purchase and plan to order a second one to live inside my car .
the snark sn b super tight all instrument tuner is the best snark tuner i ve purchased of models . this sn has a matte type finish not glossy it has a gun metal black look to me which i prefer to the glossy finished models . the dial is easy to read the bars on the dial are bold . all snark tuners are a great value they function as well as any brand .for a fender guitar bullets are the best choice for tone and longevity of strings . they seat snug and enhances sustain . quality can be found behind the fender name .i own several tuners and two snark tuners which are great except they re not low profile like thekorg pitchclip chromatic clip on guitar tuner korg pc please see my review of that tuner .so since i needed another tuner for my ukulele i ordered this time a snark . this one says specifically for a ukulele . i wanted to try it compared to the snark snark sn all instrument clip on chromatic tunerthe snark and snark are identical except for color . the uke tuner here is gloss black and the snark is matte red . otherwise the size of the dial face the clip itself is precisely the same . so there s nothing more ukulele relevant about the versus the . the tuning is chromatic so it s good for any specific instrument mandolin guitar uke banjo etc . .so choose whichever color you prefer and go for it . sweet tuner . superb graphics on the dial colorful accurate and inexpensive but not cheap build like the korg . highly recommended tuner .
this bowl is cute and difficult for my daughter to lift and throw . however if your high chair has a smaller tray this bowl will not fit . for example we have thefisher price healthy care deluxe booster seat blue and the bowl does not fit on the tray it is too large for the tray .these are exactly what i expected and fit into our playtex sipee cups . they fit just right allowing flow without leaking .this product does not fit all bath tubs . we have an oval tub and it did not come close to fitting it due to the crazy arm on it . there was no way to remove the arm and the seat does not have suction cups on the bottom so we had to return it .
i purchased this plus the little dividers and store my earrings in it . it s just the perfect size . the way i buy jewelry i think i may need to buy another one soon !i have been looking all over for a to z file dividers just this size . they are great quality material i am ordering another set for a different file box . i wish they had a larger size for letter size files .i use these clips for everything . there a good size not to big and not to small . i do also buy the small ones . they re good too . but you can do so much more with the medium size .
this chamois works great . very absorbent and holds a lot of water . do not use anything else to wash your car .this is the best stuff to use to polish your vehicle . it does not leave a waxy mess when trying to wipe it away after dried .there s really not much else to say . i will never use anything else for my vehicles . for a true showroom shine get you some liquid glass .i use these instead of dish rags to wipe up small spills clean the bathroom dust the furniture and clean windows . not the same one of course . then i throw them in the wash and reuse them . make sure when you wash or put them in the dryer do not use a softener .
i m obviously unable to give an entirely accurate review considering it is the fish who eat this . i ve asked them over and over how they feel about the tetramin and i ve gotten no responses . i m not sure if it s because they hate me for it or if it s because they love it so much that they re at a loss for words . i m going to go with the latter right now but if i can manage to get a real answer out of them once and for all i will update accordingly .my cats love these treats and i love knowing i m giving them something healthy ! i trust halo they make great cat food so i was excited when i seen these and had to try them . . .and i m glad i did !i have tried this advantage and recently frontline tritak . i m going to try activyl now . i m keeping my fingers crossed .
i bought this for my m old now m old . we have used it for months and still love it . i have no use for the cover or the insert now that he has figured out taking it out ! i have used two link toys to anchor the tray insert down one link on each side and that works . i just don t bother with it anymore though pros its small compact and fits in a chair at the table . sturdy tray that s small enough for the dishwasher . i can t think of any cons . . . . . i will say i read many reviews on this chair before buying it . a lot of review said its the only high chair you need . i m not sure about that . it was great for my m old and maybe for m and up . . .but i cant see a little baby sitting in it . not enough support i would think . oh and my son had no problems with the seat being too small . he fits great even with a bulky cloth diaper . the tray has positions and he is in the middle one . he is a little smaller than average but i think the bulky diaper would make up for that . i highly recommend this product ! !i really should ve read the reviews on this but i didn t see how i could go wrong . it s described very well and the pictures really sell it . i think i may have gotten one of the defective ones because the arms that i got did not look like the arms in the instruction booklet . there was not sufficient space and they were too close together in length . once i put it together there was no way to fit it onto my table without possibly breaking it or the table . it stuck at a ridiculouly high angle and would not go any further . i hope i have better luck with the next brand i try because i hate the tall rolling highchair that we got as a present . for now i am content with the bumbo . amazon is going to take it back as defective and refund me the shipping .i have read tons of reviews before i chose this booster chair . fortunately it was a good choice .my baby looks comfortable in this chair it is easy to use and clean . she was almost months old when we ordered her chair and it still makes me smile when i think about it how happy she was when she first tried it . o we do not use the little tray because she knows how take it off but i do not mind that .she is inches tall and her weight is . lbs now and she still has plenty of room to grow .
this kidco configure gate is worth every penny if you need to enclose and odd shaped space ! we needed to block off a hallway in our basement but had uneven walls and this gate works perfectly . the installation was a little bit involved since you have to screw the brackets into studs in the walls but it only took about minutes and we had it up .some tips for installing the gate . first read through the entire instruction manual before you start . the way the manual is structured there are instructions in several languages in the front and then reference pictures in the back . if you read through the manual and flip back and forth until you understand the pictures before you start it makes the installation go pretty smoothly . . try to mount the brackets to studs in your walls . since you can configure the gate to any length angle by changing the angle of each joint try to configure it so that you can mount each bracket to a stud in the wall so you don t have to worry about energetic kids pulling them out . . try to configure the gate so that each joint is at least at a degree angle . if you put them straight across the gate will flex a little bit . it doesn t really affect the stability of the gate since it is anchored to the walls but the flexing will go away if you angle each sectionoverall this gate worked for enclosing our odd shaped space perfectly and i would highly recommend it !we got this for a one step down into a den . well this gate has a metal plate across the bottom which becaome the cause of many trips baby included . also the handle mechanism actually fell open aprt . the first time dh just screwed it back together . it did it a total of times before we just took it down . the opening is very narrow . i have many scratches and bruises on hip from that gate . dh too . if you are really skinny with no dh okay maybe . also when walking through when you turn to close and push down sometimes the plastic didn t go under the red tab totally defeating the purpose of the gatewe purchased this gate for the top of the stairs . we live in a townhouse and have an unusal stairwell i suppose . installing this gate was a great pain ! we could not find a stud in the wall to match up with the areas we would need to install it at and had to purchase toggle bolts to better secure the gate into the wall . . . .so a toddler putting lots of force on it would not rip the gate and the drywall out thus tumbling down the stairs . also we have molding and while the gate does come with extenders to work around over the molding it didnt work for us . we had to install the gate above the molding thus leaving a to inch gap from the floor to the gate . this is bad ! our daughter has tried to squeeze her way under the gate to get down the stiars and almost managed to do this feet first . luckily i am never out of view of her upstairs nor not upstairs with her small townhouse ! and only purchased it for the safety of knowing she wont lose her balance at the top of the stairs . i have only used this gate for a top of stair gate so i have nothing else to compare it to . hopefully it is only that i live in an oddly shaped home and it works great for most other folks .note it does take a lot of measuring up and making sure that every point matches up perfectly or the gate will not operate properly or smoothly . i do however like the top lift bar to open the gate and it is easy to unlock and lock back into place with two button ontop the lift bar handle . while i still had problems using it as a top of stair gate i do think it would work very well as a doorway gate .
stellar product for polishing cleaning and keeping the bike looking great . she works on the engine paint fiberglass plastic chrome and anything else on the bike . do be careful spraying on the seat or tires i wouldn t recommend . this product doesnt come off too easily and will spread with heat . if you spray on the tires or seat it will look great but your butt and the bike will slide everywhere .you certainly don t want your expensive rack to get stolen . this is cheap insurance . fits well and works well . i do not leave my rack on all the time so this lock pin does not see harsh weather or repeated rains . for me it works exceptionally well . i like the fact that after it is unlocked to relock doesn t require the key you can just insert it back on and it is locked .this is a great little deterrent to thieves stealing your vanity license plates . i m happy . it doesn t fit all cars . make sure it fits your car or else it might be too tight ! !
updated after owning the i for over a year and encountering many difficulties i am revising my once gleaming review .the i is a simple set up . pretty much run your monitors into the line outputs connect a mic or apparently a low headroom instrument to it run the usb cable to your computer and set it up within the daw described parameters . it would have been nice to know that the included plug in suite is not a stand alone program and that it functions in tandem with ableton live lite and that it could be found it in the plug ins section of ableton but i figured it out eventually regardless . ableton itself is rather dodgy and seems to crash constantly . sometimes the i seems to lock up completely so as no audio is being produced from my monitors !i wasn t sure for a very long time if this was user error an ableton problem or the fault of the i and its drivers so after the gazillionth crash i screamed ballsdogit ! ! ! and purchased a license for reaper . after going through the painstaking setup and acclimating to the new daw over the last few months i began to realize that my monitors no longer lock up but that the drivers for the i are indescribably pathetic ! ! !i had to tweak the living daylights out of reaper just to get an audible sound out of my monitors . now i m in there and the fx do not work with the focusrite drivers . garbage focusrite ! everyone i know that has reaper raves about the plug ins and the greatness and ease of the setup regardless of the interface . i have yet to experience a crash but i also have yet to experience any recording time .seriously i started reading on the reaper forums about problems encountered with the i and came across a response from david focusrite actually saying that you should not use this setup to record electric guitar . . and that if you need to record electric guitar you should get something with more headroom like the i . that is just unbelievable in my eyes !i m sure i could run this through my mixer and get the lacking headroom and just use this paperweight as a bridge gap between my mixer and laptop but why should i have to after dropping a buck fifty on this miracle ? besides that i ll more than likely still have multiple problems with the drivers !this device is clearly marked for both xlr inputs and instrument ins . there was no warning of headroom limitations anywhere in the documentation and i researched audio interfaces for several weeks before deciding on this unit . i feel lied to and disrespected as a customer now stuck with an irrelevant piece of outdated technology . how in the heck does this thing have a nearly star rating ! ! ! ? ? ? ?the good side is that the mic pres are nice and warm . i have a bunch of different mics and the i when not crashing or locking up the monitors seems to handle all of them well . i constantly check for driver updates and have the latest drivers for the i but without a doubt the focusrite scarlett i is probably going by the wayside along with my faith in focusrite and their products .sorry focusrite you dropped the ball here .i share another reviewer s opinion about this pedal not being comfortable at certain treadle angles . however because there is very little output in those lower positions i don t find it to be an issue . in fact i rarely feel the need to use the full travel of the treadle when doing volume swells . i thought it a bit strange that this thing specifies a volt ac adapter yet can be powered by a volt battery . so . . . i decided to see if i would have any issues if i used my one spot ac adapter on it polarity corrected of course . it worked just fine . i usually power my looper with the same adapter so i built a splitter cable with labeled polarity specific terminations and everything worked fine . my curiosity didn t end there though . i wanted to know if there would be any discernible difference if i used a volt power supply . i did it and the only difference i could find was that the power indicator led was just a wee bit dimmer using the volt adapter . there was no change in the sonics whatsoever nor was there a reduction in output volume that i could hear . so what s up with the volt adapter spec behringer ? did you think you could fool all of us out here ? i give it four stars because even though you don t have to use the pedal s full sweep it just not very comfortable in those lower positions . i ll probably get used to it eventually .i used this for a while but now i have the behringer ch rack mount and this rarely gets used . also every single bass guitar amplifier that has been on stage when i was the soundman had a balanced direct output right with xlr connector right there on the amp . i still use this for practice at home .
i will keep this simple . if you want to have a wet look paint finish this can help you achieve that . this is how i got my year old car looking like a show car . . wash you car with meguiars car wash . make sure to get all the dirt off . dry thoroughly . i use a super absorbent chamois to speed up the process . make sure to do this in the shade . the car s surface should be cool to the touch . . use the meguiars claybar . keep going until your hand glides on top of the paint . this will give your paint a glass smooth finish . . apply meguiars paint cleaner with a random orbital buffer or meguiars buffer . this will remove any stains and very fine swirls . . apply this mirror glaze with the random orbital buffer . wipe off and buff using a microfiber cloth . . apply your choice of meguiars waxes with the orbital buffer . i personally prefer the meguiars nxt wax because i dont have to wait long after applying the wax before i can wipe off and buff . . maintain this new finish by using the mequiars ultimate quick detailer often to clean any dust tree sap or bird droppings that may land on your car . the detailer will keep it lookng great and also extend the uv protection .you just need to do this entire process once or twice a year . regularly you just need to wash your car at least once a week . and you can re apply meguiars wax once a month or as often as you like as their waxes do not damage your clear coat . that is why i only use their products .liquid glass is a terrific polish that goes on easily protects for months and actually creates a deeper shine with additional coats . i don t know if i believe the hype that many coats of liquid glass create a scratch resistant shell on your paint but as a meticulous car nut i can say that liquid glass is the best polish i have ever come across . this polish goes on easily with a microfiber cloth and comes off very easily with another microfiber cloth . it is not a wax but rather a clear acrylic coating . i highly recommend it .pros long lastingdeep superior shineeasy to apply buff offcan be used in suncons cannot be used over existing coats of wax polish unless you use lg pre cleaner fairly expensivetough to remove cured polish once appliedi posted a picture of my liquid glassed blue shelby above . good luck .i use the applicators for more then waxing cars . they are also good for staining wood . the fome applicators work ok but don t lay wax evenly when waxing paint . i wet the applicator and ring out the extra water . just making the applicator damp . apply the wax to the applicator fold the applicator in half so the wax spreds and apply to the paint . same way as the movie . . . . wax on wax off . . . .lol
despite being very happy with my hp officejet the ink has turned out to be a painful expense . in the past six months i have gone through three of these cartridges . i hate to single hp out but the entire inkjet industry is guilty of fighting price transparency with inexpensive printers and inflated ink . this is not to mention the constant changing of ink cartridges models . does hp really need different models of ink cartridges ? no . it would in fact be much cheaper to consolidate the cartridge offerings . however this would lead to excessive duplication and remanufacturing by third parties .what is particularly amusing and perhaps offensive to some is the enclosed recycling envelope that comes with new hp ink cartridges . this prepaid envelope with the empty cartridge goes back to hp so that it can demonstrate its environmental leadership . of course hp doesn t want the empty cartridges to go back into the hands of companies that refill and remanufacture them . although i haven t done the calculations i would assume the transportation and handling costs would actually do more harm than good to the environment . my suggestion is to fill the prepaid envelope with torn up remains of the consumer packaging that comes with the cartridges .i have owned the brother hl laser printer about a year now . i have no quarrels with the printer itself but the cartridges are a real pain .the first four cartridges i used the copy cartridge . they ran out really quickly so i shifted to the tn copy cartridge .here is the amount of copies i got on the four copy cartridges .this is the performance i ve gotten on the first two tn copy cartridges i ve used and ! ! ! for the latter a black line appeared on the right side of the page after copies making the cartridge useless even though it still had ink .tip for getting more copies from these brother toner cartridges you can often get an additional copies after the red light on the printer starts blinking indicating you need to change the toner . but it is very irritating having that light blink all the time .i am trying to figure out who i should complain to about these very poor product . . . . every single toner cartridge i ve bought from them so far vastly under performs up to on the number of copies promised by brother . .i get to extra copies from each cartridge .after the toner life end message appears it refuses to print even one more copy . offensive . . .until you show it who s in charge .remove the cartridge and find clear plastic port holes one on each side . the printer shines a light through these to decide when to shut you off . but it s too sudden and too early .cover one or both windows with a small piece of masking tape . you can put the tape on the outer drum unit holes if you prefer . i get about copies per cartridge instead of .i really like brother printers now that i have taught them some manners .to save even more money trysol corp non oem pack toner refill kit for use in brother tn toner cartridge . comments questions welcome 
i have large dogs all over lbs and one lb rat terrier mix mutt . the product is great but bad price ! i can buy for at walmart .product works as labeled i use the big end for my big yorkie and the small for my little pound yorkie .get the large one it s not too large but an appropriate size i would assume after receiving the large one that the small one is quite small . i have a lbs cocker spaniel mix and he loves treats . the quality is great and i have seen at pet stores at a very costly i price .
used this to pull the rear axles in my jeep grand cherokee laredo x due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak . works great . would recommend .fits my low clearance mazda that comes with alloy wheels and inches of clearance between the inside of the tire and the suspension . have not tried it in the snow yet .could a wheel chock chock is a wheel chock could chock wheels ?in this case .good build quality worked well on my ag tires on the rear of the tractor .
the hp color printer cartridge prints the colors it is supposed to and is fairly crisp .good paper that prints nicely on an inkjet . i would really recommend it for use of black and white and color jobs . works wonderfully on my canon inkjet printer . the brightness gives a great contrast .i always use hp printer cartridges for my hp office jet all in one printer . the hp color cartridge prints out beautiful colored pictures posters and labels which i use for my church bulletin boards and tops group . i highly recommend this hp color cartridge for your hp printer .
planet waves makes good stuff . take the load off your shoulder from that old jazz bass and get a padded inch wide strap . it s long enough to allow my bass to rest at arm s length . i can adjust it to fit my acoustic guitar which i hold much higher and check out the little pick pocket . i like these well enough that i have four of them .sweet little neck stand . very light weight . folds compact to fit in your guitar s hard case or gig bag . padded to protect guitar neck .it is okay . it serves the purpose . it is a good fit for the soprano uke . a pull tab for one of the zippers broke off within a week . not a big deal i just stuck a zip tie in its place . the case is not a cheap trash bag style gig bag but a heavy nylon with some padding to it . it has a pocket on the front to hold some small gear . there is no support for the neck inside like in a guitar case . it will keep your uke from getting scratched or dusty but will not provide much more protection than that .
does what it does and has what it said .works good so far .buy it when you can have compatible staplersworks as advertised . the labels do warp a bit with age but this does not affect how they print or attach .works as expected
i ve cloth diapered all of my kids and i have to say these are by far my favorite . i ve tried expensive a piece diapers but these just work better ! yeah they aren t as cute but they work and that s all i care about ! never had a leak and i love the natural cotton . hard to find in an aio diaper . most are synthetic material which lead to stink and build up issues . the people saying these are bulky . . . .huh ! ? are you comparing these to disposable diapers or other cloth diapers ? nothing is going to be as trim as a disposable they are paper these are cloth and these are actually very trim for cloth diapers ! i started using the infant size when my youngest was lbs and even then they were trim . with that said these work are durable and priced right !these flannel wipes are perfect sized for my lo . only thing is these are not as soft as other flannel wipes i bought from a different seller . still love it though for the prize !these are very thin and not as absorbent as other cloth wipes fleece that i ve used . they are good for wiping spit up moreso than baby bottoms .
i bought this because it says pink . what i received is not pink . it is not the purple one either . the part number is correct but it is in between and very close to a purple sort of magenta . it s not anything like the picture and yes my monitor is color calibrated so don t blame it on my screen . if you are looking for pink pass on this item .it is what it says it is does what it says it does . it is non glare which is important to me when i am flipping through a ton of pages . it is top loading i don t actually understand why they would make side or bottom loading i would think they would just fall out too easily . and they are page protectors . this brand is fairly thick does not tear easily in my experience and i have purchased i think three of the count boxes so far . i need more and i will buy them again .one of the better highlighters i have used . i like the transparent view to see how much of that yellow liquid is left . not disappointed at all .
i really like this seat protector for the infant car seat and base for the bench int he back of my infiniti g sedan . it really protects the leather seats from any indentations . it is very durable and stiff and for that i think it protects much better than the other seat covers that i have found in the stores .my only real issue with this product is that it does not seem to grip the bottom of the car seat base at all . it seems to me that it should be a bit more rubbery rather than plasticky on the top to provide a gripping surface for the base . i have sort of diy remedied this by placing a non skid pad between the seat protector and the base but it does seem to be a defeating of the purpose and a bit ugly as i have to be sure it stays in place so it is a little bit larger than the base . in hindsight it could have worked as well to buy some non skid strips to put on the base itself but then it would be relying on some kind of adhesive to stay in place .it really is a shame that the company did not test this aspect of the seat base as otherwise it would be hands down one of the best purchases as an accessory for my child .update i changed carseats now i use the chicco nextfit and this protector really is perfect . i think the base of the chicco is much grippier and nothing slides anymore . it must be something with the graco bases that cause the sliding around .disclaimer i love the chicco nextfit if you are looking for a convertible carseat or toddle seat do yourself a favor and buy the nextfit . it is the best .we installed these beneath our kids britax carseats in our car that has fabric upholstered seats . the material of the seatsaver seems to be dense enough to be doing a good job of preventing severe seat indentations . unlike other reviewers complaints we do not have a problem with the seat cover not curving down over the edge of the seat . it is properly curved in place and is doing it s job of preventing our kid s feet from dirtying the seat upholstery . i m quite happy with the purchase so far .grandma was not ready to give up leather seating in her car and wanted something to protect the leather from damage when a booster seat was installed . the prince lionheart two stage seat saver seemed to be what i was looking for . not only was it somewhat more rigid than other seat protectors but it came in tan so that it matched my car s interior . additionally since i live in south texas the lighter color is more desirable for purposes of keeping the vehicle s interior from getting so hot . there should be no issue with the seat saver staining the lighter leather black as based on reviewers comments some other brands do .the prince lionheart two stage seat saver was easy to install . the base filled one of the back bucket seats the seat saver s back needed to have been about longer to completely protect the booster seat back from coming in contact with the vehicle s seat . further it would have been helpful if each side of the prince lionheart two stage seat saver had tabs that extended over the seat back . that would have prevented the booster seat straps from digging into the vehicle s seat when the booster seat was correctly installed . because of the vehicle s seat depth the prince lionheart two stage seat saver s front flap does not bend at the marked area but still provides a bit of protection to the seat edge . having a little one who likes to drum his feet makes me appreciate this feature i do wish the flap had been a bit longer and had multiple grooves for bending .there was no sliding of the britax frontier sict booster seat which was installed on this seat saver the booster seat held firmly in place . the backing on the prince lionheart two stage seat saver is a rubber like mesh similar to the material used to keep floor rugs from sliding . since i have not yet had the seat in place during one of our very hot texas summers i do not know whether there will be a sticking problem . i will probably remove the booster seat during the summer unless our little one is visiting so that i can avoid this potential problem .i would have rated the prince lionheart two stage seat saver a . if that rating had been available . with the exception of the suggested changes i am very pleased with this product .
you expect tape to do a couple tasks adhere and disappear .scotch does both . rolls . . . means more of what tape needs to do .this tape is thin and you can use it effectively if you re careful but you definitely have to get the feel of it imagine driving a new car with sensitive brakes . however its tack ness and thinness don t work all that well together especially when it s hot and i d say out of pulls on the tape dispenser get ruined . so bottom line if you are not a rushed type person and you really need to save money this tape is worth the savings . but if you have some room in your equipment fund use it for better stuff .this tape does exactly what it claims to do . . . your presents will look impressive . . . with no signs of the tape . i would definitely buy this again .
great for a wide receiver for tacoma or tundra . it can be hard to find a hitchpin that is for a wider reinforced receiver . this works well with some small room to spare . highly recommend .sizes listed in reviews and the two in the description . x . x and . x . x don t match to what i received . . .the bag i received is in between what has been listed in the descriptions . x x empty .while seemingly a good quality bag with a fair amount of straps and attached rain cover hidden in the heel of the bag it seems the manufacturer or seller has no idea how to use a measuring tape !the bag itself is quite nice . . . good padding rubberized bottom to prevent sliding small pockets on either side and zippers seem of reasonable quality .for the price and bag quality i m not complaining . it works great on my cb and it does fit on the pillion of my vt c without having to remove my rider backrest so if you have standard seating or a touring adventure style this bag will do well for you as a pillion bag and with a little strap adjustments it also fits vertical on the front or back of a sissy bar or horizontal on a larger luggage rack . . .i bought two sets total . i use them near the middle of the lifting range which puts the saddle about to inches high . this is perfect to get my truck off the ground and give me an inch or so of ground clearance to r r the tires and do other work underneath the vehicle .i don t need t worth of lift but i like how these j s have a wide lifting range . with these set for my range as stated above they are not teetering at the top of the range like others i ve used in the past but are comfortably in the middle . they are very stable and solid units .it would be helpful if the info stated the lifting range of the units not just the tonnage they can support as a pair .min . lift height in . max . lift height in . 
the d addario balanced tension strings are a good value and worth slightly higher price . these are excellent strings the type that a gigging musician would likely use on their guitar . they are inexpensive and sound great . for somebody that is a casual home musician coated strings might be a better choice . the difference somebody that plays a two or three hours every day will wear out a set of strings long before corrosion sets in . somebody that plays an hour or two twice a week will likely never wear out their strings and corrosion becomes the bigger problem .the big question for me is the balanced tension worth a little extra money ? it seems like yes they are . the strings are slightly easier to bend and feel just a little bit better . there isn t a huge difference . the direct comparison string is d addario exl d addario exl nickel wound electric guitar strings regular light at roughly . a set these are good solid strings at a bargain price . the exl bt strings are about . a set . if i were going through a set of strings every few days the exl s would probably be a better idea . but if a set is going to last a week or two the savings overall is pretty small i would use the exl bt s .my personal preference is coated strings i like elixir strings a lot . the new d addario coated strings are fine but they end up being about the same price as elixir . i ll stick with what i know well .my lucille did love these strings . they worked out just fine .on the packaging i don t like what d addario has done . all the strings are in a single plastic package i prefer individual paper envelopes . they loop two strings together and i hate that . when i m stringing my guitar i like to work with one string at a time and this silly double loop makes me leave one string opened up on the bench . sometimes the strings get crossed over when unlooping them and it makes me mess with the strings for a while . they are trying to save packaging and that is a good thing . but seriously that little paper wouldn t kill anybody . i also don t care for the color coded rings on the strings . lucille has an open bridge where i can see those electric colors . it is a small thing but i don t like it . i prefer that the rings all be brass one color . yeah i m the only one that sees that problem . if i work one string at a time from an individual envelope the color coding is not necessary .these are fine strings . they are a great price and provide a little bit easier bend .the d addario exl bt nickel wound electric guitar strings balanced tension regular light are great ! i ve been a long time fan of d addario strings and these strings did not disappoint .they were very easy to string my fender strat with and stayed in tune a good long time . the strings had a good feel to them as well .where i noticed the balanced tension the most was when i played chords . you know how you have tuned your guitar and it s tuned as well as it s going to be tuned but when you strum that first chord something just doesn t sound right ? you check the tuning and it s tuned alright but why isn t it sounding right ?these strings gave a clear clean sound when i strummed those chords . bar chords were terrific too . impressive .i think i have some new favorite strings for my strat !strung these up on my lp goldtop with p s .d addario promises these strings to be comprised of mathematically optimized string gauge combinations that result in greater dynamic control and a more consistent feel between strings . i dunno anything regarding the science behind this but the main difference in gauge seems to be slightly thicker a and d strings compared to the regular set of d addario s they offer . its not a huge huge difference but the strings are fairly unique in their feel and performance .for one thing they re pretty stiff . they bend but not easily . maybe that s what they mean by balanced tension . they re also a tad mellow for roundwound nickel coated s . not flatwound mellow by any means but not quite as bright as your regular set of s . i do get a great rock tone out of them mind you but you may be taken aback at first by their slightly darker sound . personally i like the tone i get out of them they re big and warm without being dull sounding but again your preferences might differ .one thing that s great about these strings is once they re properly stretched they stay in tune forever ! again maybe this is part of the balanced tension and if so good job d addario .i haven t had them on forever to really see how long they last but they ve been on for two weeks and sound just as good as day one .who would these appeal to ? well if you like really light strings that bend easily you re not going to like these . if you re a rythm player who does long gigs the tuning stability and big warm sound mean these are for you !
this product works great . just remember this collar takes special batteries that we can only find at our local pet store and are for two of them . otherwise the collar has worked great on our dog . i like that there are three different settings on the collar .i have three petsafe collars that i have had for years or so . they have worked very well until recently and are starting to fail . but they have been used a lot on large active dogs outdoors so i am happy with the service life . that s why i decided to buy another one .this new collar seemed like a great improvement to the original models when i read the info on amazon s web site and in some ways it is . but the very poor collar design that supports the control box renders it horrible . it has both a clasp and a clip which is a total pain in the a to put on the dogs . the new clip isn t strong enough to stay connected on its own and the clasp is a pain to use . it worked fine in its original form so why did they change it ? i will be buying a collar with a good plastic clip and remounting it .you can turn it off and adjust the power level both of which are nice improvements but . . . .a few thing i don t like about this product the collar loosens and has come off by itself . it may seem like an innovative collar design to have both a buckle and a clasp but it s not . it s a very cheap collar . as another reviewer stated it s worth buying a quality collar to replace the el cheapo one that comes with the device . hey i bought one from the grocery store for dollars that is higher quality . also because it s very important to have a dog bark collar that is snug but not overly tight or too loose a buckle is terrible idea . the holes in the collar are at about inch increments so your most likely not going to get the best fit . buy a collar that allows for a custom fit . other reviewer s mention that the collar repeatedly shocks their dog for no reason at all . i ve also experienced this and it was due to user error . i had my mini aussie sitting in the truck next to me and i was talking in her ear telling her she s a good girl and i saw her head bob as it does when she is getting a static correction . i looked at the collar and the setting was set to test . she was getting shocked each time i talked to her . setting it to off or a regular setting fixed the problem . kind of a design mistake if you ask me . i don t like the thought that i could accidentally leave the device on test while i m in a hurry to get out the door and my dog gets shocked the rest of the day . it s the lowest setting shock but just moving or slight sounds set it off . make sure you don t leave it on test mode . the rfa proprietary batteries . while they are not going to break the bank at for dollars plus shipping it does add up . my first battery was depleted in aprox . weeks of continuous usage . another reviewer briefly mentions that she was able to pry the battery out and replaced it . i have not done this and instead was able to find a company on ebay that mentioned their website rfa i don t want to directly link but you can search for rfa battery holder . disclaimer i have not yet used this product so i can t comment on it . but i can say that it will save me money because it uses the ubiquitous cr watch batteries . shame on pet safe for profiteering on a battery revenue .what i like about the collar seems to work better than my other cheaper pet safe model . i was using a cheaper brand for a while but lost it around the house . fell into the couch cushions ! i still needed a bark collar so i spent a long time reading reviews before i settled on the pdc . i have to say that it has been a night and day change with my dog . she used to herd other dogs and not care about the static correction on the cheaper model but this model has levels of adaptive correction and when it s on of one bark is enough and she quiets down . the collar works from the start and keeps her calm to avoid escalation of her barking . i was about to get kicked out of the place i m living because of her and just today my landlord said she has seen a huge improvement . keep in mind static correction is not a substitute for exercising your dog . your dog may be barking because he she is bored . exercise your dog for at least mins hours a day depending on breed and keep it up . in a few weeks you will see the difference exercise is fun for you and your dog . yes you do have the time . just because it gets dark outside when you come home is no excuse . train your dog to run on a treadmill or buy an led meteorlite ball that lights up the night also sold on amazon and play fetch with your dog in the dark .i gave the product a out of stars due to what i view as shortcomings of the product . however it s better than most of the collars on the market so i would still recommend it .finally if you learned something from my review please click it as being helpful .
in my house alone we have a bass player a acoustic guitar player a sax player and a violinist that is not counting myself i attempt to play mandolin and harmonica usually i fail so diverse instruments used to require different tuners but with this little all in one the clutter of tuners and pitchpipes is history i just set aside a music nook in the family room with this mounted to a music stand and everyone can tune before practice the sax player sneers at us tuners but still finds use for the reference notes and metronome function built into this little beauty .just be sure to buy thekorg cm l clip on contact microphone for tunersif you want to tune your instrument while others are playing .i don t gig . it is unlikely that i will ever play in front of a crowd . but if you re like me play as a hobby and like to fart around with various sounds and genres this amp is a blast . it is very likely that i will play a johnny cash song on tuesday and a metallica song on wednesday . pretty much just make sure your guitar is in tune and dial up the sound . no pedals no hours of minor tweaks just punch it up and learn the song . virtually every genre is represented here . i also have to mention that although i like metal i rarely play it . i prefer traditional r n r sounds and the spider iv recreates tons of my favorites in addition to the high gain ultra noisey sounds . even with the best modeling in the world my les paul does not sound like a strat being played through fender . it sounds digital . no getting around it .something else that weighed into my purchase was durability . although i only play for fun i still play hours a day . my year old also is learning to play so it gets a lot of use and moves from game room to garage to bedroom daily . the one thing that was common in virtually all of the reviews of line amps was that they were long lasting and durable . i have a family member that is a professional musician and one of his band members gig with the larger just becuase they can take such a beating .ultimately i decided that for the price at the time i couldn t beat the line . there is just no comparing a tube amp with effect pedals against a solid state modeling amp . they sound better more prefessional . they are also designed to be played loud to get the most out of the tubes . although the line sounds tinny and at max volume for in home play it sounds terrific . there are mountains of reviews that compare the line to vox marshall or fender . they are all better than the line every one of them . but be prepared to pay times the price for effects pedals head units cabinets cables etc . to get those flawless professional sounds . good amp great value .if you own an iphone ipod touch and play guitar or bass you need this one .was a gift from my girlfriend and i love this .the sound is incredible .buy it seriously .
running to pedals on my board this was a logical choice of power . the single transformer running into the board with the multi plug was easy to set up and the small profile of the plugs combined with the thin cables makes for a neat and uncluttered board . there is no lin drop of power and the devices are able to draw the current needed to work at their peak . further with the transformer being well away from the board there is zero ac hum . what s not to like here ?works great no issues . bought this to adapt the mike plug to jack so the mike can plug into a regular amp for the grandkids to karaoke with .on the plus side it does the job powers your v pedals and doesn t break the bank . . .on the down side this unit can be a bit noisy depending on which wall socket you have to plug into . neon lighting can raise hell with this power supply . . .but who ever said playing out live was gonna be easy ? best to have a noise gate handy . . .just in case .
these brother dk die cut standard address labels work perfectly in my brother gl printer . we use these to label products in our small shop and on occasion as address labels . the printer recognizes the labels and automatically provides the correct template for the label .this is a great system !highly recommended !cfhto me avery is like the standard when it comes to printing labels . the reason i say this is not only because of their high quality labels and products but because when you buy it you re pretty much guaranteed to find a template already in your office productivity software e .g . ms word excel . avery now has the added feature of being able to design the labels directly from their website and print go to their website and then click on design print . avery is truly going the extra mile to make the process of printing labels as simple as possible .i ve been using avery labels for years and they continue to improve upon their already excelent products . this product in particular adds a special feature that they call trueblock technology . for most people this would seem like trivial . a label is a label whats the point ? for those of you that want to re use old folders and completely mask the previous label marking this label does the trick . after printing out a sheet of labels i placed them over folders with permanent markers markings old printed labels pens and more . on regular labels you may be able to see faint outlines of what was written before . with these labels i was unable to detect any previous marking . works as advertised !there are sheets of labels each with labels for a total of labels . whether you print or write directly on these file folder labels what amounts to less than cents per label you can t go wrong with this . unlike some of their other labels this particular one worked well with my epson photosmart printer as well as my ancient hp laserjet if your printer has the option to be sure to specify that you are printing on a label versus a regular sheet of paper .needless to say i highly recommend this product .make note that this product is for laser printers ! great product for office or at home use . if you have a mass mailing to do you will find avery templates and labels extremely useful . these products come with easy peel technology to make sticking the labels on envelopes even easier . anytime you have to print labels look to these avery labels . a good value for your money . you can address envelopes with just one package . do you know how much time mail merge a printer and some avery labels will save you . you won t be disappointed !
first of all american cars mostly using low wattage light bulbs which is good cause most misadjusted lights don t bother you that much and power supplied through the headlight switch .therefore lights are not really bright . also if you have old or worn headlight the best bulbs won t make a difference .i used these bulbs in a marquis except for the lights to appear much whiter we did not notice any difference in brightness . lights and reflectors were in great shape .at the same time we put them into a intrepid and wow what a difference !first off all the headlight color is white . this is even more dramatic at a clear night when sitting next to a car without these bulbs .second they are slightly brighter . don t believe any of the ads telling you that you can suddenly see feet further this is impossible due to legality as you would blind oncoming traffic . but the beam is wider you have a bigger spot of light in front of you .third during rain i found that these lights provide a sharper contrast between the falling rain clear raindrops and other objects . the beam of light on the road seems to be crisper .end of story i think they are worth it .i own a nissan frontier and the oem headlight bulbs were the regular sylvania halogens . these oem s have tremendous life but i noticed that they are starting to fade out their brightness are decreasing significantly . time to change and i opted for the silverstar ultra after seeing it in a tv commercial and based on my experience with the oem s . after installing it i noticed that they were only marginally whiter and brighter than the oem s . the huge difference was in the angle where the beam of the light is being projected it is much more wider than the oem s . i work night shifts and there is a significant stretch in my drive where the roads are really really dark . with the silverstar ultra s its like your fog lamps are turned on too because of the wider angle of light projection . overall satisfied with these bulbs but again the brightness and whiteness are only marginal . nevertheless its a worthwhile purchase .my rare chevy is about to get upgraded headlights . have not installed them yet so i can t say i love them yet . from what i ve seen these dot approved glass lens metal bodied units with heavy dust covers will not be noticeable to a novice eye . look at the photos on the desription page there were no surprises for me . cool nova . hella vision plus mm high low beam v halogen conversion headlamp hb x .
i bought these mics to fit a shure mic and a gls mic and it doesn t fit either . a little too small .i knew it would be small but i wasn t thinking this small it shore is cute good enough for now but not for the long run shore its loud for the size but it rattles when you turn it up and amps slides from vibration if you keep it on lower sound its fine this is only for temporary use for me . its an ok tiny mini little amp for it s size its good don t exspect a fender amp thats all it sounds like it s behringer . very fake cheap sounding phaser but it s all i need . i got it mostly for that big airplane woosh and running it in the loop it does that fine . the highs are kind of harsh but if it is in front of the amp it can sound a little tame .
better than regular tennis balls . i do like the all rubber ones better though . they don t hold the slime as much .much better than plain charcoal and is a better price than the same thing in the stores . it is a larger container than i thought .much better than the standard stiff stuff . simpler to route . the stiff stuff always wanted to kink when i routed the lines . i would like to get a larger quantity to stock .
does the job for which it was intended . added to hot water and dissolved pour it into the base of the air o swiss humidifier to clean any scaling and other old water contaminants . then thoroughly rinse without dunking the base under water and do this about every months .it is a shutoff does what it is supposed to . camco rv water tank filler with shutoff valve . would buy againthis works very well for blowing out water supply lines in an rv s plumbing system . be aware that there can be water still in the lines even after blowing out air through every faucet so when winterizing it can t hurt to use a rv safe antifreeze just to keep the water at the low spots elbows valves from freezing .
do not expect this to sound like a fender frontman with x speakers . but for practicing in your bedroom or similar it s perfect . plenty of sound effects to mess around with . are they as good as dedicated per stomp box effects ? probably not but so what . just found out the best part of this amp . you can connect it via the usb port to your pc not only for using the rather cheesy fender software but it lets you pipe your guitar s sounds into software like garage band . you can thus save yourself a dedicated audio interface like an m audio m track or similar . ps it is not recommended to go directly from the guitar to the mic or line in in of your computer even with the right adapter plugs as the impedances will not be right . on top of that i have connected the mac s headphone audio out to the amp s aux in ! sounds much better than listening to the pc s normal puny speakers .update while the built in usb interface does work a dedicated device with good pre amps like the focusrite i is much better in getting guitar audio into a computer .update to the update while i am keeping this amp for convenience i have quickly learned that nothing can match a real tube amp . you can simulate all you want and i am talking much more expensive sw solutions its like imitation chocolate vs . real chocolate . got the marshall dsl watt combo . amazing sound .works well on my amp not so well on my computer workstation . it s a decent dj announcer mic or for a pa but i wouldn t record anything like singing or music and expect great sound . has that great heavy mic feel but is definitely no shure mic despite the similarities .the behringer usb premium input mixer is just what the doctor ordered . nice unit and works perfectly for vocals guitar bass guitar and keyboards . don t lock yourself down with a bad usb cable
i rcvd my black trim line phone today . out of the reviews i only read the rated ones to see what was said . several people said people on the other end cannot hear well . i immediately tested mine and called friends who both said they could hear me quite clearly . it is funny how there are always people who harshly criticize products in these reviews yet so many other people do not find anything wrong i wonder how that can be can there really be such a big difference between one unit and another . i thought i would like the black color best and it cost less than the white but i see now that the black shows finger print smudges very easily . i will be keeping it on my bookshelf for use during power outage .i received these return address labels shortly after i joined the vine review program . i was interested to see if they would function as the package promised and they have ! unlike other labels i didn t have to struggle and swear while peeling them off the page to place on an envelope . i m looking forward to obtaining more when this package runs out .this review is too the point this item is as advertised . so if you like the ad you will like this item ! ! i am satified with mine !
item works as described saves crooks from sealing your gas . key works smoothly in cap and with a turn its uockedthis works . sort of . . . and with problems . first of all it will pump up your tires but don t expect to set the gauge and top up all tires accurately to the preset psi . i had to unplug the unit and then reset the shutoff limit between the first and second tire and again between tires three and four . checking with a gauge after only tires two and three had the same psi and were within one pound of the preset shutoff limit . tire one was too high and tire four was too low . be careful not to jam the nozzle onto the valve stem all the way or else you may snap off the locking tab trying to close it or the rubber gasket may stay stuck to the stem threads . the whole unit has a flimsy seal to it . the light works and would be handy if you needed the unit at night . the flashing red light is pretty much useless . it is too dim to stand out in the glare of oncoming headlights it can t be used if you are using the clear light to pump up your tire . your hazards are much brighter but if they didn t work what are the odds that your car will have the power to light this red flashing light ?none of these type of units will compare to the air hose at the service station or a real air compressor but for emergencies and occasional use they generally work pretty good . you should have a good quality pressure gauge in your vehicle at all times anyway to help keep all your tires at the same pressure so the built in gauge on this may not be a deal breaker for you . this unit works reasonably well and the light comes in handy if inflating a tire in the dark or even if you need a light to change a tire . the gauge and shutoff preset i wouldn t depend on . for a similar unit with similar features and price and an analog gauge and shut off that really works i would recommend this one instead campbell hausfeld rp volt inflator and worklightor if you don t need the light or gauge this one campbell hausfeld rp volt compact inflatorthere are better choices in air compressors than this unit . i don t like the fact that the digital gauge stops working after it reaches the preset pressure . the unit must be unplugged and plugged in again to get the gauge working again . also the gauge is not very accurate . the compressor takes too long to inflate my car tires to the correct pressure psi . it may be good for light duty stuff like pool floats and the like but it is not powerful enough to inflate auto and truck tires . this may be a good compressor to leave in the car for emergencies but there are better choices . i purchased this campbell hausfield compressor for under several years ago and it is still working great but it doesn t have a pressure gauge campbell hausfeld rp volt compact inflator
this was great until it wasn t . even though i had the problems with the noisy impeller after i put a little vasoline on it it stopped the noise . everything was fine until i came home today to do my weekly maintenance and the filter was dead ! i know it was working last week when i did a water change but i have no idea when it quit working . fortunately i have two filters running so my fish are ok . this filter only lasted six months so i m very disappointed .i should ve known when i first tried putting in the battery when i tried to remove the battery which is seriously difficult it ripped off the metal contact point wasting an expensive but otherwise new battery that this product was no good . i figured since amazon s return policy is a bit of a pain i would stick with it and see . well about months of using it it started developing problems it would turn halfway then backtrack then turn to the intended slot . now months in it completely ping pongs back and forth and it won t stop i have to turn it off midway and then turn it back on so it will turn to the correct food slot . i figured no problem i m still under the year warranty wrong ! i checked the manual and they only offer a day warranty . what ? ! had they offered a year warranty and i was out of that year warranty i would ve bought another one as a replacement . but the day warranty is pretty worthless and shows they have no confidence behind their products . i ve already purchased the qpet timed automatic pet feeder hopefully i won t have the same issues .other dislikes horrible warranty noisy motor unable to set actual time only or hour time intervals from initially powering it on uses expensive d battery thought the battery has lasted quite some time .after reading some reviews i purchased this filter to replace a failing in tank back filter made by tetra . this does such a nice job is so much easier to clean and i love that the filter media is really adjustable for your needs you can put layers of whatever you need in it . i used the sponge carbon and zeolite that came with the filter but plan to switch to sponges in a few months with the carbon . i just have been very very happy with this filter and when i get the new set up for my goldies i intend to get another larger version for them too ! very very happy .edit i actually did get the larger version for my goldies in december . i wanted to update my review of the filter but have looked for minutes and cannot find it though amazon says i reviewed it .anyway the smaller filter i haven t had problems with but the larger version kept stopping and a couple times i did not notice until the water became cloudy . my fish have suffered from it .the maintenance directions say to clean the impeller every months and this i have been doing on both units . i contacted the maker hagen and they asked me to put veg oil around the magnet part of the impeller . i tried this as well but it was loud and i didn t trust it anymore . within a couple weeks it had stopped working again .hagen said i had to send the motor unit back to them with tracking and insurance recommended at my own expense and now i m waiting for some sort of response . meanwhile my goldies are depending on a filter that is too small for their tank and an airstone while i wait . . . if i don t get some response soon i will be downgrading my review to reflect this .i wish all glass aquarium company made filters . when my light stopped working they sent a new one out first and asked questions later and fish don t even need a light for survival like they do a filter . rather disappointed about hagens policy for defective product since now i m out a suitable filter and one of the goldfish seems to be having swim bladder issues since the time the filter stopped working two times ago and another has gotten a couple white spots on his tail . i ve had these fish for years have taken good care of them and have never had any health issues before . . . and feel a bit bitter about this whole thing .
this desktop paper trimmer is perfect for my home office . i am always looking for a way to cut my scrapbook papers which are x . this swingline paper trimmer will cut up to inches which is just what i needed . the paper trimmer is listed as lite and it really is light weight . it is easy to handle and you won t hurt your back when you pick it up . the handle comes with an extension which is removable for storage . the blade is very very sharp and had a hook to lock the blade when not in use . it also has a grid and scale for measurements and a guard rail for safety . i highly recommend this guillotine trimmer for all paper trimming uses pros i was able to cut through sheets of paper fairly easily . note however that it requires a little exertion to cut through or more sheets . the cutting blade is very sharp and is self sharpening . the manual says each cut actually sharpens the blade so the blade never gets dull . the trimmer makes nice clean cuts and is able to cleanly shave off the tiniest piece from the edge of the paper . it is built very sturdy and the swingline brand name promises exceptional durability and performance . the trimmer looks sharp pun not intended and will make a handsome addition to the stationery in your home or office . cons the guard rail is about an inch from the cutting edge so this cutter might not be suited for very small jobs . the board on the trimmer is not constructed from solid wood but from a chipboard slab . the top is laminated to make the board look like solid wood . as an upside however the markings are clearly printed and the laminate is so realistic looking that initially i thought the board was made of solid wood . the underside of the trimmer is somewhat crudely constructed can you say fussy ? . conclusion functionally this trimmer gets a resounding stars ! construction wise i wish the board was made of solid wood . also the guard rail gets in the way of very small jobs . all in all the swingline classiccut guillotine paper trimmer is a really good paper trimmer and considering the price it is a good value for your money ! if the specifications meet your needs i would definitely recommend it .i ve worked with many trimmers and paper cutters from large matt board cutters costing hundreds to a hand held knife and this item is superb as a hobby tool . not industrial level or for commercial heavy use . i m a retired art teacher and can vouch for this item working on all sorts of paper from very thin newsprint to stiff poster board . recommended paper is up to . i scored and cut card stock with ease .my primary use is for cutting items from all kinds of paper like newspapers computer printouts and photos for my genealogy documentations . my wife is super excited about using it with her card making hobby . it also scores card stock perfectly . also highly recommended for scrapbooking although understand it only makes a straight cut .by using the lift carriage clear plastic guide bar which holds the cutting tool you can position paper below and actually cut out the inside of a small matt or frame .the vertical paper allowable for cutting is a bit over inches . horizontally the sky is the limit and a swing bar gives measurements up to . i found the visible cutting edge to be easily aligned not needing reliance on the grid for straight accurate cuts . the clear plastic arm that holds the paper in place allows a full look at the item a huge advantage over other cutters i own which the bar is made from metal . i have no complaints whatsoever for this product but i do use it for only small projects less than . i find it works as easily on my lap desk as it does on a work table . it has rubber stoppers underneath to keep it in place on almost any surface .replacement blades are less than per pair scorer cutter but i ve not needed to replace the titanium blade yet . very pleased very pleased indeed . 
unlike some other reviewers i have found no quality issues with mine it came symmetrically bent with a plastic pad that doesn t smell like anything it holds my harp exactly where it needs to be and is easy enough to remove all i need to do is loosen the bottom wingnut rotate the harp away from my mouth and lift the frame over my head .to change out harps bite down on your harp use your hands to depress the tabs on either side and then pull your head back sliding the harp out as you do to insert a new one place your harp in your mouth depress tabs and use your mouth to center the harp in between the plates when it is in position release tabs making sure not to get your lips caught between the harmonica and the plates as they pinch shut .i agree with all the other star reviews the quality of these strings is excellent .they last with great tone for a reasonable time and don t break .i just have a helpful hint for those people with little experience in re stringing an acoustic guitar that has removable bridge pins . put a crimp or bend in each string about of an inch or so from the ball at the end about degrees from the straight portion of the string fairly sharp . just beyond or just on the wound portion that holds the ball on . then push the ball into the hole and make sure the crimped portion of the string is slid up against the wall of the hole closest to the neck of the guitar out of the way of the pin . then slide in the pin and make sure the ball is not resting on the bottom of the pin ! the pin should fit tightly into the hole and the crimp you made in the string keeps the ball on the side of the pin not below it . each pin has a groove in it where the string passes into the hole on the side of the pin . after pushing in the pin you can pull on the string in the direction of the nut and the ball should be pressing the pin sideways in the hole keeping it tight . it may be under or on the side of the bridge inside the guitar but i can t see in there to verify this is so but i know that the ball is pressing sideways on the pin ! not upward .hope this helps some novices i had to learn it this way myself .now all i have to do is install these on my burswood strat copy . i know i m gonna have to drill holes for the locating pins i may even have to drill the tuner holes also . look forward to getting those crappy loose un smooth original hardware tuners off this thing .july just installed these fender locking tuners on my strat . didn t have to drill the tuner holes they were the perfect size . placed all the tuners in the headstock lined them up with a straight edge and just pressed each tuner very firmly into their hole with the locking part screwed in tight so as not to damage them and very lightly and carefully tapped them with a small rubber mallet to mark my drill points . then with a small magnifying glass and using a punch i made a center punch mark just using pressure by hand with the punch since wood is soft on each indent that the tuner made . set my drill depth with a piece of tape on the drill and was done in less than minutes .
this sounds like an excellent idea but it just does not amount to much . i registered for it because cold wipes seem inhumane compared to what this product could do . however this product has some downsides only gets half of each wipe warm soaks the wipes because of the condensation inside which in turn has contributed to diaper rash if you do not use the wipes quickly enough then a quarter of the stack ends up drying out we use the wipes warmer in the nursery for nightime naptime changings only before purchasing i recommend examining one that a friend has if possible .this product is definately not necessary but does work great . before having my little girl i read in a parenting book that newborn girls expecially in the winter are very sensitive to cold wipes . it was recommended that you wet them with warm water first . so with my baby girl due the end of november i figured why not just register for it . a friend of mine bought it on the testimonial of her cousin and i am so happy she did . yes it does dry out the bottom wipes but really only the bottom one or two . you have to keep the moistener pad wet . i usually soak it with water every few days or so . i do suggest huggies wipes not only because they stay moister but they are so much softer to the touch . and yes the pop up feature is really a bust . only the first couple of wipes can be pulled out of it but the reach in lid is still far easier to open than any plastic tub or bag of wipes ! my suggestion to you register for it and if you don t get it buy it if you have the money to spare .i returned my dex wipes warmer and have been very happy with this prince lionheart model . it takes a bit more maintenance with the moist pad at the bottom but in the long run the maintenance pays off . the dex model is terrible and severely dries the wipes out while you re pulling out wipes at a time .this model has a more rigid opening so you are only pulling one wipe out at a time . it is intended for pop up style packaged wipes pampers . adding water with each refill will keep the wipes moist and warm . leaving the lid open accidentally will dry out the wipes .i gave it stars because i would hope for a slightly better drainage design for the condensation in the next model .
i change my tank once a week since my turtles are so little . it is essential that my water is ready to go after i do a tank change out each week . this product seems to do the trick it takes out the chlorine .i have two small westies and since they are constantly getting dirty i wash them times per month . after a day of being washed i use the for each of the dogs which is about full dose a month and this does the trick .haven t used this product for very long . maybe months . i use it for my lethrinops and they seem to love water change time what fish doesn t . even after a few days they are active and thier colors begin to pop with each water change . i only dose once a week for a change and dose for that not the existing water . i was scared to buy thinking it would be harsh on the sensitive lethrinops but it isn t . i dose in small quantities at first then graduated to the full dose upon water changes . liking it so far !
well the other guys are all complaining about amazon s shipping charge . amazon s free shipping for over offer comes and goes so if you see it in effect it is as of today grab whatever you need . as for buying the ink tanks just buy all three colors in the set at the same time to qualify .anyway let me talk about the ink tanks themselves . the three bci ink tanks work in the canon pixma ip printer . maybe in other models as well but i have the ip . these are official canon ink tanks so you ll know they ll work well . the number of prints you get heavily depends on your printing habit e .g . what you print how much you print and at what quality you print .using my usage as an example . i print at normal quality most of the time and i print about photos at or dpi depending on needs and web pages e .g . flight confirmations hotmail messages etc . . i don t print word text documents much . i ve run through sets of ink tanks and my very rough estimate is each set has lasted about . x sheets . maybe more but i don t wish to raise your expectations too much . suffice it to say that of all the inkjet printers i ve owned photo or not the ip has a terrific ink capacity record . of course if you use one color more than the others that particular ink tank or ink tank combinations will go out faster . for your reference a few months ago i read in a magazine review the the average per letter size print cost of the ip came out to around cents per page on plain paper one of the lowest average costs for inkjets . not sure what settings they used in their tests or how much they paid for ink tanks though . in case you are interested . . . the new canon ip model employs a new formula of ink which supposedly will not fade for at least years . my own take is no matter how you print your photos even at professional photo labs a photo print will eventually fade if exposed to light . it s just a simple law of chemistry . so be sure to archive your digital photos on cds or dvds so or years from now you can still print fresh copies and relive your treasured memories in their full colors .these were a sample from amazon vine received a few months back . i hadn t had a reason to use them until i thought i d gussy up this year s holiday cards and give em a test drive .i used avery s online label maker star software ! after going to their site to pick up the ms word add in i ve used before and finding the very capable online version . i created a set of return address labels and ran a set of ms excel based mailing addresses created from my email contacts . quick and easy .i ran the labels through an epson artisan inkjet multi function printer . no special settings just put the labels in the paper tray and went for it . the label content consisted of the address info and a small but intricate graphic .results the reproduction was excellent brilliant colors and crisp detail . the only negative was one sheet which didn t feed exactly right probably operator error . they parted from the backing easily and stuck to the envelopes firmly with no wrinkling or smearing i waited about minutes after printing .nice labels nice software happy holidays !i have desired and wished for a useable fax machine for years but thought that they would be too costly or complex for my tastes . after a lot of research and reading of reviews on various machines i ordered this one from amazon . one of the best decisions of my life ! this little guy was just the right size was very affordable had every feature that i could imagine and was a dream to set up and learn to use . everything went like clockwork and within a very few hours had it purring . first test was for copying and it just took right off and gave me perfect copies at the push of button . the next day had to send off faxes to close a financial deal and again lickety split it sent off all the faxes first try by just reading the manual the recipient immediately verified receipt .for the uneducated on these machines you don t need a separate fax telephone line or number to send faxes . it did it s thing right over our normal phone connection .i highly recommend this little guy . it does everything a fax machine should do and does it easily and well .for the record on brother the manufacturer i had a question that the user manual just didn t quite answer and i called the customer support number listed in the manual and very quickly had a knowledgeable service rep on the line that quickly patiently and courteously took care of my problem . it s been a long long time since i had such good service for a new product .thank you amazon and brother !
works great but is on the small side as in not a large diameter gauge would be easier to read if it was bigger .get the large one it s not too large but an appropriate size i would assume after receiving the large one that the small one is quite small . i have a lbs cocker spaniel mix and he loves treats . the quality is great and i have seen at pet stores at a very costly i price .great size for someone with a smaller dog and perhaps a smaller stature . i wouldn t recommend this amended size for a tall person .
booda perches are great ! they can be manipulated to fit different size bird cages and add variety to the perching needs of our feathered children .perfectideal for airlines that have temperature extremes . seems to remain flexible under a lot of different conditions . i use it for outdoor hydroponics airline . great stuff !
i needed a way to boost the input of a wired lapel microphone coming from the preacher directly into my powered speakers . works great !each bx d speaker has its own amp onboard and power supply . want a channel system buy speakers and run xlr audio to each one . no noise or hum . has both trs and xlr inputs has a knob for gain control on back . most importantly each speaker has an iec connector for power to just that speaker . mine sit left and right of my mixing panel using trs outputs which copy the xlrs those go to my marantz pmd digital recorder w gb of datacard memory onboard and a nice set of vu meters . speakers include a foam stick on bottom to prevent buzzing against hard surfaces . there is however no mounting point no captive nuts or such .you ll need to adopt a philosophy on gain . you can crank the speaker gain to and use your mixer to set the levels but ensure that your recorder gets enough signal to be in the to db range . it may be a tad loud in that case you may want to set both speakers to their oclock position which is power approximately .you could alternately use the mixer to run near db and turn it way down on the speakers . i like to use mine to listen to talk shows before falling asleep at night so i turn the volume way down but drive them with db off the mixer .having a separate power supply and amp for each speaker makes for some great isolation .my first nitpick is there is no grill cover on these like other maudio products have . i will have to fabricate some protection . my second nitpick is i owned the smaller m audio monitors where the amps were in the left speaker and the right speaker connected with twin lead speaker wire to the left i .e . not true bi amping but smaller spkrs for my mixer . the speaker w amps died at mos after buying it . it was not the power supply as being on made the box warm but the led surround around the vol knob would not light and you could barely hear the audio even with db into the trs line in . thats a different cheaper model by maudio but i had to trash it and buy these which are much nicer !i do like this set of speakers . from stereo to . surround they do the job with differential audio inputs . i may get more for ch as i have a sub already .i m pretty new to using mics and pa systems but have used dynamic mics in the past recreationally . this condenser mic is way larger and heavier than a dynamic mic i was surprised when i took it out of the box . it is as good looking in person as in the pictures . three things for the benefit of other newbs . i learned that condenser mics are very susceptible to moisture and so you have to purchase a windscreen if you re going to use this for vocals since moisture from singing into the mic can damage it . . this has a cardioid pickup pattern you don t sing directly into the end of the mic like a dynamic mic . this should stand straight up on a mic stand paying attention to which way the mic is facing since it there will be a lot of attenuation on one side of it . . it requires phantom power . you need a pa that provides v power to use it .when i first used this mic i tried singing into the end of it and couldn t hear myself very well . later in the evening i was standing off to the side and could hear myself so loud that i had to back away about a foot from the mic . then i remembered reading about the cardioid pattern and stood it up straight on the mic stand paying attention to the orientation of the mic . it was so sensitive that i really had to stay backed up from the mic and it was easy for two or three people to stand around it for vocals . i have a rainsong ws acoustic electric guitar i was playing and was able to turn off my amp completely because this mic picked up the instrument and my vocals so clearly . other musicians were impressed by it as well . i payed just under a for it which i think is a great value for this product .
i have used these tab dividers for as long as i can remember . this particular set is dividers red yellow green blue clear pink light orange and dark orange . each tab is connected to a yellow sheet of paper that is hole punched . the paper is lightweight so if you re looking for something sturdy that will last through rough usage this is not your divider set .i like these tabs for my light binder that i don t use often it stores some info i need to have on hand but it s not a high use binder . i also like that i can switch out the tabs you write on them i know old school who doesn t type them on computer and print out anymore ! . but they re handy for switching out without having to get on computer and make new tabs .overall these work and serve a purpose however i highly doubt they will be available much longer as the digital world takes over .these are my favorite flags since there are colors the others don t usually include orange . the packaging can be clipped onto my bookmark and the flags will still pop up . the package is thin enough so it won t break the spines of hardcover books when the book is closed . i use these while i m reading or researching and the colors are nice so i can color code quotes websites to look up later important points or passages . . .later i can go back and get to them much more easily knowing which color corresponds to which data . yes i am a geek . when you need to use colors to highlight different things these work great for that and i like it that you can use any color you like and still see thru it some highlighters are too dark to see anything thru to the words
installed one on my cf martin almost leaving a thumb super glued to the inside of the guitar . an interesting experience would have been almost comical to arrive in the emergency room with my thumb stuck to the inside of the guitar . i m sure that some of my dna still resides in the guitar .bought another for my brand new taylor gs mini mahogany after hearing what a great acoustic sound was coming from the cf martin through a brand new kustom sienna pro acoustic guitar amp from amazon . i ve read that folks prefer the k k over the made for the gs mini taylor pickup .get it .i bought this for my acoustic . bought another one for my electric schecter hellraiser solo . holds my bass guitars easily as well .this stand is designed to work on electric guitars not acoustic or acoustic electric guitars . the arms that support the guitar are short and not adequate for acoustic guitars . this is however perfect for my lp and sg guitars . i love its size and portability .
just as expected it holds dog food seals nicely and the casters on the bottom although cheap make it easy to move around if need be .this does exactly as advertized . the little ledge on the top makes it easy to slip under your litter box and it s easy to lift up and shake out over a trash can .perfect size easy to clip on jeans or a belt and love the fact you can tighten it or loosen the drawstring easily .
i ordered two of these bins to hold rice and flour for my kitchen . i ordered these specific bins because they were air and critter tight . i didn t want to attract unwanted guests to my food supplies . i was very happy with the sturdiness and weight of this product . it appears that it will suit my purpose well and i am totally pleased . i was unsure of the size of the container as it pertains to my storage needs so in case you want to know this size bin holds pounds of longrain white rice . i think it will hold about pounds of flour as well but i have put only in it so far . the wheels are holding up well contrary to some of the other reviewers experiences with these wheeled bins .this is a great product ! i bought it for one of my bulldogs . our bulldogs love these toys . they are one of the few toy products that actually stand up to a bulldog ! the only thing i did see wrong is the size . . . and maybe i m just an idiot but i think that you should say size inch not size or or whatever number you associate with its size . you automatically assume that a person knows that the number size label is in inches .i have one of these that i have had for years and love it . wanted to order another and needed the one that will hold lbs . in the title this one states size lbs . however . . . .this one is tiny and no way that it will hold lbs . in the further description it says that it holds lbs which i didn t read as i stopped at the title but i am hesitant to believe that it even holds that much . so if you are looking to put a lb bag of food in this . . .no problem .that is the only reason for the one star . other than that the product is great for it s purposes . it is not intended to be air tight . it is easily opened with an arm full of dishes etc .
i love the whole avent system ! these are great sippy cups in large part because all avent pieces are modular and fit each other . so if you have been using avent bottles you can put the sippy cup tops and handles on the bottles .you can pop out the magic valve that makes this a sippy cup and fit in the nipple from the bottle . or you can take the collars from your bottles and fit the magic valve in it . it is wonderful ! especially since you have so many ways to fit the sippy cup together if you have already been using avent bottles .these fit both my medela spectra dew pumps . my medela is ancient at least a decade old but the newer pump parts still fit it so these go from the standard bottle size to fit the avent bottles .i have both the super wide nipple avent bottles as well as the classic size and these adapters fit fine .i also have the avent via storage system and the wider converter fits those just fine as well .i don t know what the other reviews mean about leaking . . . . i put the bottle caps on that come with the bottles tops that fit the storage containers on as soon as i m done pumping . if my milk is nearing the top of the bottle container while pumping i switch out bottles . but while pumping i ve experienced no leakage .i use playtex dropins bottles nipples which are larger than average nipples . these nipples do not fit well in the nipple compartment of this dishwasher basket . i can only wash nipples at a time in this basket . the latches to open the different compartments are very snug making it difficult to open them quickly or with only one hand .
should you need to connect a condenser microphone to a phantom power box so that it will work with an ordinary amplifier or mixer without phantom supply this is a good length for the link .very simple device to connect a quality dynamic microphone or instrument using a direct box to the usb input of a computer . i plugged in my mic and plugged the cable into my pc . win automatically searched for and found the drivers in about three minutes . i then recorded some vocals using audacity a free open source download . recording was whisper quiet with no background hiss or noise at all . recording level was great not sure why some reviewers said it was too low . note that this will not provide phantom power nor does the item description imply that it will . usb only provides vdc and phantom power usually requires vdc . unless there is some kind of power converter which would be much too large to fit in this compact package it is impossible for this or any similar sized cable to provide the higher voltage that phantom power requires . use this with a dynamic mic or direct box and if you use it correctly you will be very happy !the listing for this item can be confusing if you are not sure what stereo xlr is . stereo xlr is meant to be similar to your stereo headphones where left and right are separate unbalanced wires . this cable is configured to be a stereo unbalanced xlr to a stereo unbalanced trs cable . this item is not a mono balanced xlr to a stereo unbalanced mic cable .a little bit a soldering can fix this connector by moving the red wire from ping to pin with the white wire . pin then ties to pin with the ground wire .
users might have trouble understanding exactly how to use the gauge without the instructions in hand because the design isn t intuitive . but i do really like this item .simply taking a pressure reading is easy enough power on hold it in your hand with your thumb on the raised bumps on that little slope above the big round button and press it against the valve until it beeps a couple of seconds later . the reading is very accurate and the display easy to read in any weather condition . and once you set your target pressures in the unit you can see how well your reading matches your preferred pressure . on these points alone i give it four stars but not five for the following reasons . the gauge powers off only a moment after you take a reading so you have to start it again and select front or rear for each tire . there should be a way to set how many seconds before it shuts off . i don t even remember what the biggest button on the gauge does but both its placement and the way it s marked causes you to naturally think it s the power and reset button . it s not . if i have to guess it s probably enter for when you re setting it up with your target tire pressures i don t remember . bottom button don t remember . the bottom line on design here is too many buttons which aren t intuitive or logically placed .i probably should compare it to another to see how accurate it is but i really like how easy it is to use and turns off and on by itself .this is a high quality well made grease gun . it connects well and you have to move the connection sideways to pop it off the grease fitting which is perfect because you do not want on that pops off easily . i pumped a lot of grease through this into hubs and the pressure was high the pump action was smooth and nothing leasked . when disconnected it also does not leak it does not pressure out unless you pump it .
after a power outage i connected my refrigerator to this power supply . sadly its inverter was unable to support my refrigerator . the duracell dpp hd doesn t have enough momentary output to handle the initial start up current spike of a refrigerator s compressor motor . the specifications say it can momentarily provide up to watts . this equates to amps at v . yet public benchmark figures for a home refrigerator s start up current indicate amps for up to second . other appliances that use electric motors such as sump pumps are likely to exhibit the same characteristics . my suggestion is that customers immediately test this product with any device they intend to power during an outage .some important specifications are missing in the amazon listing . one of the key statics is the capacity of the internal battery which is amp hours at v . this equates to watt hours . yet ac output is much lower than this presumably due to inverter losses . these losses increase with power output . the following table illustrates this . the last column is my calculation .load . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .watts . . . .hours . . . .watt hourscordless telephone . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . portable stereo . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . laptop computer . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . fan . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . tv . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . drill . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . warm air fan heater . . . . . . . . . . . . . . blender . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . hid floodlights . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . observe that the total energy delivered watt hour drops with power consumption . ultimately the usable energy is significantly less than what is contained within the lead acid battery .for reference a refrigerator will use about watts of electricity when the compressor is running . typical consumers will have their refrigerator running about to of the time which equates to an average of watts being consumed continuously .consdoesn t handle current spikes associated with certain electric motorsprosboth ac and dc outputportablesimple operationworks as intended easy to plug in and charge the motorcycle batteries .i double checked with volt meter at the end of charging and was at proper voltagei ordered different chargers to maintain my gate opener s deep cycle battery a simple output charger with extension cords for charging other deep cycle batteries from amazonbattery tender dl wh v bank battery management system and this unit has a far superior charging design .the bank battery tender does a simple fast rate charge then switches to a trickle charge at a constant voltage with outputs .this unit pulses the battery under charge and features operating modes with different current outputs for different sized batteries . the selections are motorcycle which also works well for sla gel cells or agm batteries standard automotive starting battery deep cycle batttery and off .what makes the ctek unit special is that it uses a pulse charge in all modes to attempt to desulphate batteries while the battery tender does not . this method of charging has proven successful in restoring lead acid batteries that won t take a charge any more .it comes with a waterproof v output cable and a set of clips or rings for permanent installation under the hood of your car . in addition to the leds for indicating the type of battery being charged a second set is provided for empty full and maintenance pulse charge mode .there is also a noticable increase in quality between the battery tender and this unit small details like a water sealed housing and gaskets on the connectors indicate quality in manufacture .for a single v lead chemistry battery this is a useful well made tool .
the picture is slightly misleading . this is only the mounting bracket it does not come with any wiring . but is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a wire flat cable . the bracket is flat on one side and curved on the other . the curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch . the connector on the end of my t connector fits well and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket . it sure beets having the connector flopping around !very quick and easy mounting and really adds to the look of the rear of the jeep . these are metal and not a cheap plastic and mount with included screws into the existing lens cover screw holes .needed to replace a broken mirror . this one fit right onto the existing metal holder that was still cemented to the windshield . it has a lock screw to hold it in place . if you need to replace the metal holder it is included but no glue is supplied . overall it is a perfectly fine basic mirror .

the specifications state x . x . inches . with the wheels it measures . in height . of course it will not slide into my pantry at that height .now i either place it outside in an unsightly plain view position or drag it in and out of the pantry . i will bet in a few months that the unit breaks after pushing and pulling since the plastic is sort of brittle . the corners of the wheels are flimsy and not engineered well enough for the added stress of daily maneuvering where the wheels attach to the unit .seriously pass this if you are on the bubble of a decision .i orderd this for my g tall . the picture is deceiving . there is a front piece of glass and a back piece of glass and then a small piece of plastic . if you have a hob filter or anything somewhat big you will not be able to use this canopy . junk .we were looking at the glass door inserts but not only do they not allow your sliding door to lock but they are hundreds of dollars . since our only goal was a way to let our cats in and keep the flies out during the day we were leaving our screen door open for them this seemed like a perfect alternative .it was easy to install i do suggest leaving a little more screen then they suggest when you are doing the cutout and works great for letting them in and out .a couple of items about it to help you make your decision if you live where there are alot of mosquitoes or gnats they will be able to fit btwn the cracks in the unit . you will have to close the glass door to keep them out . works great for areas like ours in ca where we just have to worry about flys and wasps .i recommend installing it in the middle of the door . when i lock the cat door they paw at it if they want to go out and it can get rough on the screen . we installed it in the middle of the door and so we can just close the glass door halfway to keep them from pawing at it .
considering the grotesque cost of ink cartridges this vendor gave very good value for the money .this ink is great as is my epson printer . and while the quality is good and the price on amazon is cheaper than in costco by about five bucks i gave it a four stars because of price . printer ink is just too expensive .i have a brother hl n printer and i m really happy with it . i bought it at a local retailer at a decent price . but that same local retailer charges a lot more for this toner cartridge . amazon s price is tough to beat .
these hangers work great but make sure you purchase some spare screws . the screws provided easily break when screwing into a stud so i would recommend you buy some good screws before you install . i have several of these and at least three screws broke as i screwed them into the stud in the wall .i put these on my dlx players strat but it wasn t a piece of cake . first problem . . . no instructions came with the package . found a method done by another searching online . served as a guide . second after removing the old fender tuners i noticed the new tuners didn t fit into the slots . this meant drilling out the holes by another of an inch . blue tape both sides as to prevent marring . third the new unit using a tightening center nut rather than screws to the headstock . there are also with two dimples . i used a ruler clamped to the headstock for keeping straight alignment and another clamp to press the dimples into the tock for drill bit placement . then carefully drilled two holes per tuner . take you time on all of this as not to damaged the finish on the headstock . these rest was simple . install the tuners and tighten the nuts is now a breeze . if you are not mechanically inclined then i strongly suggest you go to a luthier as this is more than a simple replacement job . for the price you think they at least provide specs and some instructions .replacing your pickguard ? lost a screw ? authentic replacement screws if you need them . i ordered these with a new pickguard for my strat in case i lost or boogered up one of the screws . exactly like stock screws .
it s about the size of a credit card and half as thick as a deck of cards . it s fairly light and the plastic feels a bit cheap but it does the job it s supposed to do . you can either play the notes to the built in mic or connect it directly via a guitar cable . it has a switch to change between bass and guitar and it accounts for the extra strings on string basses or string guitars .it also has a button to tune it down lower half steps so you can do some alternate tunings too .lastly it has a button for sound so that it produces a tone for you to tune something to manually . the display is very fine and kinda hard to read but it has lights above the lcd screen to show if it s flat in tune or sharp so you can focus on that if you have trouble .it comes with aaa batteries . i have no idea how long they ll last yet but i have some rechargeable batteries for use in it later .i just received my blue radius shock mount and i was immediately floored by the the size and looks of the unit . it reminds me a set piece from fritz lang s metropolis the rings around saturn or something built by tesla . it s a beautiful thing certain to impress anyone who might sit in front of it to be recorded . certainly beats the homemade inch pvc pipe and bungee cord shock mount i previously had made and my yeti mounted to . what is impressive about this mount is you have full and clear access to the the yeti s knob s mute switch and usb headphone plugs on the bottom of the mic whereas my homemade version gave me fits with knob access . once you screw the yeti into the machined shock mount base there are teflon or maybe white delrin washers which allow you to swivel the mic easily to access the back knobs or move it toward any position say a guest speaker with great ease . the build is hefty machined aluminum rings with stainless steel mounts and screws . the elastic suspension bands are not going to fly across the room as they do on most shock mounts because they are not threaded on hooks but securely fastened to brackets then the holding screws . the radius also allows you to mount the yeti on a boom stand upside down which i have always been told is the best way to mount a condenser type mic so dust and moisture spit does not build up near the capsules or internal electronics it just falls as gravity allows .does a shock mount make a difference in sound ? to my ears yes especially if you are recording into say a laptop on a table the fans and hard drive are going to vibrate coloring your overall sound with unwanted hum . although the mic stand the yeti comes with does an o .k . job of dampening vibration it is not going to give you as much isolation as the radius which will be noticed when the gain controls are turned up . there is also the science of unwanted resonance from instruments rooms or cabs vibrating your stands that s why you see most professional studios using shock mounts you just get a cleaner sound . in a test the radius works like a charm even from pounding on my mixing desk . a . earthquake is not going to cause any vibration .on the down side just to play devils advocate the radius is huge and may nor be suitable for tight spots or portability . that said the yeti is also a big microphone and once mounted may add six inches to the overall space you will need to use this setup properly . next when you un mount the yeti from it s built in stand you are going to have gaping screw holes in the side of the mic . i fixed that by screwing the old yeti stand screws back into the holes which actually looks kind of neat to me . to some maybe it will look like bolts in the frankenstein monsters neck but i think it all fits together . next smaller base microphone stands will want to tip either angle the yeti plus radius back or get a bigger stand this is the one i have and would highly reccomend thesamson samd md desktop mic stand . lastly this mount will only work as far as i can see with a blue yeti or blue yeti pro microphone maybe some other mics will work but not likely .in conclusion the radius is an easy set up works great and makes a yeti look retro futuristic sexy ! yeah it actually looks really cool like a spaceship blasting off or landing take your pick i know people coming into my studio are going to say what the heck is that and where can i get one ! ? i may tease and say it s and award or art piece .addendum if you thread another shock mount into the radius you get double protection . it also looks great to talent in your studio . over kill or uber cool you decide . see pictures .first of all let me say from some of the pictures i have seen posted of this pop filter when put on a yeti mic stand the clamp will fit on the stand as pictured . this is a design flaw not with the pop filter but with the yeti stand as this filter has been around long before the yeti came out . blue or a clever do it yourself person could easily fix it by drilling more holes into the side of the clamp mount . then you could move it forward and simply screw the side mic mount screws into the stand . there are many great pictures of other clever fixes as well . since i have mine hanging upside down on a boom stand attached to a blue radius shock mount this is not an issue for me but i will say it is a problem blue should fix . i have written an addendum on the bottom for a great fix . other brands of filters will give the same if not more problems . i am not going to knock any stars off because i m reviewing the filter itself which is superb and how it works for me .now for the meat . this is a studio grade high quality product all metal except for the two tightening knobs . the dual screen design eliminates any plosives p s and b s for example better than any screen i have used so far . this is especially true when the screen distance is about an inch from the yeti capsule screen and you are to inches away from the unit itself which i have found to be the yeti s sweet spot in the cardioid pattern . next the silk screened blue logo also helps you find the sweet spot if you place it in front of the capsule area . i like the idea of a metal screen especially if you are transporting it you won t have to worry about snagging or runs as you do with the cloth filters . speaking of old cloth filters i have a neumann which is about years old a very nice screen as well but it does not cut the pops as well as the blue especially if you get closer to the mic and screen . also when reading copy or maybe music i can see over and through the blue filter much better than the round inch jobs like the neumann . you can contort the neck of the filter in any position easily cheaper filters i have used in the past will creep back into unwanted positions the blue behaves . the blue pop is absolutely transparent no muffling as with foam filters the curved design of the blue filter also protects the sides from plosives and possible proximity errors of a poorly placed screen or none at all . the screen is a solid build as are all of the blue products i have used so far . it also fits the look of the yeti and radius shock mount like a glove . surprisingly i paid a little over . on amazon a real bargain in my mind for such high quality . this filter is for all the blue microphones by the way and i am going to use it on my entire collection of mics ! addendumif you need to use the yeti as a table top mic especially if you are using a shock mount and pop filter any brand i would suggest buying asamson samd md desktop mic stand which works great for this set up !
does not work for all guitars . one of my guitars has a more rounded head and it does not fit over that anyway i have tried . though with the arrow shaped holders it works as it shouldsturdy mic clip on a budget . mic fits snugly into the clip allowing the rage to commence . will purchase more as needed .this strap is not a bad one but it just did not fit my guitar so that is the only problem . i have a classical guitar and sadly this strap does not fit it .
it takes a bit of practice for my cats to push the flap with their noses and faces but once the routine is established they like to freedom to come and go . minor concern is the cats over time can move the red locking lever and sometimes lock the door by accident . also shows wear over time i think from scratching with claws .hand doesn t get tired when combing out long haired dogs ! helps to remove tangles and the teeth don t break off or bend !i love this leash ! it allows my dog to kind of wander about but i still have control of her ! just be careful not to get your fingers wrapped up or you might get hurt !
love the product it works great for my needs . i recommend it . i am happy with my purchase . you will be too !i am please with this product . it seems to improve water changes . i will continue to use it in the future .i will purchase this item so far my fish tank stand it is cheaper then purchase in store . i will recommend anyone to buy it here .
the size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous . the funnel is long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only long . it states that the funnel is x but in reality the opening for the funnel is in diameter at the widest point .it would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless .these were a perfect fit for my silverado hd with the . but i had to do some research to make sure i bought the correct wire set . gm used round or square coils two different manufacturers for a few years and the plug wire lengths are different . if you have the round coils plug wire connector on the bottom of the coil you need these shorter wires ending in gg . if you have the square coils with the plug wire connector on the side of the coil you need the longer wires ending in hh . the hh wires are about . inches longer for than the gg s . you cannot make the shorter wires reach a square coil .easy to replace . it lacks toyota instructions but it is exactly like existing toyota part with all wires colored the same way so it is very obvious how to connect those .the original part has a silicone rubber tube going all the way from top to bottom with wires running inside it . this part only provides a short length of tubing that at best would cover half of the length of wires on my car .i thing they should provide a telescoping tubing of two diameters with one going inside of the other while you are crimping wires and then extended to cover the full length of wires
i use this cable to run from the balanced xlr outs on my digital piano to the balanced trs inputs of my audio interface . it works perfectly and there is plenty of length in it . i am happy with the build quality and would recommend this to anyone .should you need to connect a condenser microphone to a phantom power box so that it will work with an ordinary amplifier or mixer without phantom supply this is a good length for the link .this mic stand is solid and a good value but it s a one trick pony . the picture that is currently featured at the top of the listing here is incorrect the stand comes with threads and does not come with an adapter . not a huge deal if you re using a standard mic clip .the height is about . inches total and i m using mine to mic a kick drum right at the port . if you plan on using the stand for an amp or to mic something on a podium or desktop i d highly recommend you check out the adjustable desktop mic stand from on stage . i have one of those too but it was too tall even at it s shortest setting to mic my drum port but the adjustable height is very handy .
this phone has a nice big well illuminated caller id panel and the big buttons are nice . the speaker is clear . it has a flash button for call waiting or call transfer . the only thing i don t like is that it does not have a hold button only a mute button so you can t push hold hang up the instrument and pick it up on another instrument .no caller id no bells and whistles . this is a basic solid well made phone . buttons are large and easy to press . has speed dials and memory locations . last number redial . tone pulse switchable . one drawback you cannot program a pause if you need to dial for an outside line not a big deal but you should be aware of that .the phone works very well . i hear clearly and the people hear me clearly . the handset is large and that makes it easy to hold . you can also easily attach a shoulder cushion for holding the phone on your shoulder . the handset is a tad heavy so i wouldn t use it for hour long calls but it s perfect for extensions . and it works in a power failure without batteries .for bucks no one should complain about this phone .i bought this phone after returning an at t . ghz cordless set . i was a little wary because of the poor quality of the at t phone but the reviews on amazon gave me the confidence to try this uniden model .the reviews here are spot on . the phone has excellent range and voice quality and its minor detractors are just that minor . here are my observations pros this system is expandable to handsets including the handset on the base . this gives maximum flexibility in deploying in your home or small office . don t be confused . get the tcx handset . msrp . this is the one that is recommended for provided with this phone i believe amazon recommends some other handset . very good voice quality . clear signal no interference . this was a major detractor for the at t phone . ring tones musical ringers . you also have the ability to set personal ringtones for people in your address book . you can set different ring tones on each handset . up to numbers in your address book . however the phone book and cid system share memory so it s a total of numbers . hm . but each phone book entry can have numbers so you don t have to have multiple name entries for person e .g . mom home mom work . however the multiple entries are not delimited by text so you have to remember which is home and which is work . directlink walkie talkie mode . you can set two phones into direct mode and do a walkie talkie system . however you also have an intercom capability as well . multiple handset conference call capabilities . if you pick up a call on one handset someone else can join in just by turning on a second handset . dropping off is easy . . .just turn off the phone . there s also a privacy mode in each handset that enables you to turn off this function . do not disturb function can be set on the base it will turn off all the ringers on all the handsets . advanced caller id . capable of normal caller id plus call waiting caller id . caller id to phone book . can store a caller s info into the directory . room baby monitor . can listen to the sounds from any room that has a base handset . speakerphone on base and handsets . nice ! customizable handset banners . name them for the room where they belong ! remote access . standard stuff . only a two digit security code though . one key speed dial . set up to speed dial numbers . press the speed dial number and hold and it will bring up the corresponding speed dial entry . it doesn t dial until you re ready just in case you picked the wrong speed dial . normal answering machine features . call screen toll saver etc . i wish it had a dial out notification .cons no dial in remote room monitoring . this would be nice to dial into the system and hear what s going on . phone books and cid shared but not synchronized . you have to copy the phone books from one handset to another instead of it being sync d across all handsets . you also have to delete cid from each individual handset . base display is a little convoluted and confusing . the only way you can see if the answering machine is on off is when it s actually off an icon appears . this was a little confusing . most machines have a little glow light button that turns the machine on or off . you have to do this through the ui . shorter answering machine record time . only minutes up to messages .all in all this is an excellent choice and value .
the listing for this item can be confusing if you are not sure what stereo xlr is . stereo xlr is meant to be similar to your stereo headphones where left and right are separate unbalanced wires . this cable is configured to be a stereo unbalanced xlr to a stereo unbalanced trs cable . this item is not a mono balanced xlr to a stereo unbalanced mic cable .a little bit a soldering can fix this connector by moving the red wire from ping to pin with the white wire . pin then ties to pin with the ground wire .the black mike stand blends in to the background better than silver . it fits standard microphone mounts and has a wire clip to keep the wire from being pulled away from the base .this cover does not fit a full size acoustic electric hohner guitar . i measured the whole at but this cover does not even come close to fitting ! it measures in diameter so check your guitar closely !
the yamaha guitalele sounds absolutely beautiful . it s like a mini classical guitar except the recommended tuning is a d g c e a a d followed by the standard g c e a tuning on a string ukulele but it can also be turned to e a d g b e standard tuning on a guitar .on the standard tuning for a guitar however the strings sound a little floppy . a reviewer suggested using an extra hard high tension string like thed addario extra hard tension classical guitar stringsto get around the floppiness on the e a d g b e turning . you can use a capo with this instrument . mykyser capoworks on it just fine .the guitalele measures x x at their widest points . the construction quality on my copy is tiptop except for a minute area where the neck meets the soundboard which is lighter in color because it missed an application of wood stain not a big deal really . the guitalele has a satin non glossy finish which is a lot less prone to the unsightly scratches a high gloss finish might incur .the package includes a black nylon gig bag .for a high quality instrument that costs a tiny fraction of the price for a full size guitar the yamaha guitalele gl is a good buy just under a ninety as of this writing .rogue g w guitar combo amp black is good small amp for practicing .actually it s loud enoucht for home .recommend it .i have this paired with the behringer c studio condenser microphone . it matches the mic well color wise and fit . the c fits the mount perfectly . i recommend this mount highly .http www .amazon .com behringer c studio condenser microphone dp b cz rlk ref sr ?ie utf qid sr keywords behringer c 
these horns are just the ticket in replacing stock inferior horns . these are a much nicer sounding horn than the loud blast of an air horn . perfect horns to boost the warning ability of your vehicle without sounding like a big rig .works great installed it on my motorcycle and also kept the high tone stock horn . with both horns the sound is very loud it will scare the crap out of any dummies that pull out in front of me now . db stock horn db stock horn fiammif you understand how decibel measurement works you will know that is a big increase in sound .my toyota fj cruiser s stock horn was well pretty pathetic . a single horn that wasn t very loud and would easily get lost on the highway and it s amazing how many people are unable to see that bright yellow suv so a horn that works is cruicial to my survival . the piaa horns dropped in with very little work the fj is wired for a second horn so all you need are a couple of electrical tips about feet of copper wire and a mm bolt and you can put the pair of these in front of your radiator where they ll do the most good most other cars i suspect will have similarly easy installations . the difference in volume was immediately noticeable . they re not train horns and they won t make your ears bleed but they re appropriately loud car horns that install easily .
well i bought new wiper arms to replace the rusting ones on my silverado pickup . showing my age i thought it had a straight splined shaft with a release lever . the shaft is tappered and removal of the arm requires a puller . this puller worked perfectly and is easy to use . in my opinion lisle is a good brand of automotive tools .we only have stabilizing jacks on the back of the trailer so we do use the tongue jack as a stabilizer too . my husband always carried a bucket of pieces of x s to support the post . we decided to try this reasonably priced jack stand instead .it is very heavy duty and does a perfect job . they sent us a red one not the black as shown in the photo but that doesn t effect my rating at all . for the money this is an excellent accessory .this works fantastic at keeping your hopkins brand trailer wiring harness secure and looking good . with some minor modification i used this in conjunction with a curt easy mount electrical bracket for receiver tube and am extremely pleased .
ernie ball makes extremely durable products and has a very reputable name in the musician community .these strings are affordable and last a very long time on someones guitar during normal use .you will not be disappointed in this product .they sound very clean and bright and if you use a product like ghs fast fret after playing the strings last twice as long and stay clear and bright longer .they do have a coating that will wear a small amount and turn black under the strings if you fail to clean them properly .these strings are nickel which greatly reduces fret and saddle wear and they sound good . if you are using stainless steel strings you are wearing those two critical guitar components down and they will eventually have to be replaced . saddles are easy to replace fret wire can be costly as that type of work is best left to the experts which with it comes an added cost to the player . so i and many others play nickel .bullet end ? if you are playing a stratocaster with a tremolo bridge the bullets are designed to fit into the string receivers in the trem block and in effect add more mass to the tremolo block which adds and aids the transfer of tone to the guitar as a whole .those two beneficial features alone convinced me to give these an honest try and over time i ve been using these for years have proven to me to be the optimal string for the stratocaster .these are durable . do they last ? well yes they do . i rotate guitars on the gigs so i would say that if i was using the strat exclusively and playing it as much as i do through the week i end up changing them out every to weeks and i m playing nights per week not including rehearsal or noodling around and i put them through a rigorous workout .what would that equate to in hours ? hmmm . . . to hours perhaps maybe a bit more . add to that sweat natural oils oxidation and that i don t use cleaners or chems on the strings although i do wipe them down after a playing with a dry shop towel .these strings are great if you need practice changing your strings . these strings last days and then they are dull and lifeless and need to be changed the high e and the b string tend to break before they even get tuned to pitch ernie ball strings are garbage the only time i will buy these is if it s the only thing available most people like these because they are endorsed by so many musicians that are paid to say that they like this garbage and even if they do like them they are not your average players that need more than days out of a set of strings touring musicians have the guitar tech change the strings after they play their set and they get an unlimited amount of these crap strings so their guitars always sound fresh you can spend for a set of ernie ball or d addario every days or you can spend for a set of dr strings and change them once a month or you can spend for a set of elixir polywebs and change your strings once every months it doesn t make sense to use these crappy ernie s unless you are sponsored by eb and have an endless supply and a tech to change them for you like the rockstars 
it fits perfectly to my honda accord .filter quality seems to be good .bought this for my honda crv . fit perfectly and cleared the code . easy to do just give the threads some wd fits my car perfectly works perfectly was easy to install . the best measure of a wiper blade is that it does what it is supposed to do when it is supposed to do it .
my lbs lab mix loved this bone ! perfect size for him to chew on . definitely would recommend this to others !had my fair share of treat balls and this one is the only one that lasted .the rest has been torn and destroyed by my two medium sized dogs . . .the holes are a little too big for me even when i purchased the small size but some biscuits fit in there perfectly .for me i use the science diet medium biscuit treats many different flavours available and it can keep the dogs entertained for a minute or two .this toy is the perfect size for my medium as well as large lab . the lab destroys all bones but this one holds up well and it is the perfect size for my aussie mix as well .

this product surely protects my leather seats but my car seat seat slides around on the seat when its in place . i m taking mine out of the car today . i ll try it again when my son moves out of the infant carrier and into the big car seat .our daughter was in the nicu and before we left she had to have a car seat challenge . when we brought in her car seat we had the bundleme in it and we had to take it out as it was a safety hazard . these are not safe for any child as they are made post manufacturing of your car seat and therefore have not been safety tested with your car seat . many infant carriers car seat warranties will be voided if you are in a wreck and using a bundleme or other type of infant blanket that goes between your child and the car seat .this seat was recommended to me by someone who owns a caravan and who had luck with it . unfortunately i have a mountaineer and this car seat just does not fit comfortably anywhere in the back seat in the rear facing position .problems the latch cord wasn t long enough so we had to do the seatbelt install instead .the seat is so huge that our only option was to put it behind the front passenger seat . in order to have it reclined correctly we had to remove the base use pool noodles and a blanket . . . .but now the person in the front passenger seat is too close to the dashboard . for a family of long legs this doesn t work out too well .the buckle is very tricky . . . . .with practice you eventually get used to it and the straps keeps twisting .good things seat is comfortable and safe . height adjust is super easy especially in new england weather . . .when baby may be wearing a snowsuit one day and a sweatshirt the next . fabric is easily washable .i wish i had talked to other suv owners before i bought this one to see what else they recommended . i will be much happier with it when we can switch to forward facing in months .
it works well for guitars and basses so long as they are the clover style . other then that it works just like it says it will .i bought this for my m audio keyboard but it also works equally well with my casio lighted keyboard .just be sure that your keyboard has a sustain pedal connection .this is a very heavy duty unit that feels and operates exactly like the sustain peddle on a piano .i purchased a bunch of planet waves classic cables for my new pedal board . the cable is a little fat at the connector for pedal board use so if you have a tight fit this is not the cable for you . however i am very pleased to find the cable itself is quite flexible . my complaint like other reviews i read is that the end doesn t seem to fit snug on some connections . for me these cables fit very well with the mxr pedals dunlop wah and the ibanez pedal . the boss pedals however were hit or miss . can t say for sure if this is plant waves design problem or boss but it does seem odd it seems to be mostly the boss pedals . i have a couple ehx pedals also one side is snug the other loose . anyway for the money i think you will be happy with the planet waves cable nice moulded ends with a good flexible cable .

first as with all of the dupli color metalcast paints if you want the metalcast effect you ll have to use the dupli color metalcast ground coat mc on the surface before you apply the color or it will not come out right . the can says that it also comes out the same if you re painting directly onto chrome like surface but i have not tried this so i don t know . now for this green . i m more of a blue and purple guy for dark colors so only by my personal preference do i say that this green comes out just a tad light in color for me . overall though if you use the ground coat this comes out great with a nice metal sheen . i recommend this product . . . . if the delivery mechanism was able to spray it on in a wide pattern rather than a spot pattern . it took numerous squeezes of the sprayer to get adequate coverage . the product itself was excellent .this is great wax ! it truly deserves the gold class name . i use this after the meguiar s ultimate polish . i also have migrated to a in buffer polisher . i used to do all of my polishing and waxing by hand and with the buffer this turns out great . i have an lesabre that is black sapphire in color . before using the polish wax combo it looked more like a darker blue . nothing really deep . after polishing and waxing it now looks like the black in black sapphire . it looks great in the shade as it should and looks beautiful in the sun . there is a nice deep glassy color and i am pleased with the results . the water also beads very nice too .
i am please with the product . as stated in other reviews the toy does not come with a bell as pictured . that does not detract from the overall desirability of the toy . i am actually glad that there is no bell . i am picturing food and other goo stuck inside the little bell . i think that without the bell it is more sanitary . the bell is not necessary to a baby s development . there is enough to do with the rings and different shapes and colors .i bought this item as a gift and would do so again .looking at baby toys is so overwhelming . this set has all you need of course you ll end up buying more toys but really this is all you need ! . the toys are high quality colorful and they encourage exploration in play . i highly recommend this set .i have to say that sassy makes some of the best infant toys and teething toys . my son had all of these toys that come in the pack and he loved them unfortunately when i my son was a baby they didnt sell all of them in one pack i had to buy them seperately so if you buy this pack you will save some money .
what a pain to to remove the cover and does not fit some plug types . only the smallest plugs will work like lamp plugs not not thick cords like computer plugs . xbox ps etc are out of of the question . you can replace computer cables with thinner lower grade cables to get around this .this helps from letting my daughter play with the actual outlet and plug in but she can still pull the cord out of the plug in the inside . so it does protect her from being electified but she can still unplug the tv lolthis does what it is supposed to do keeps my daughters fingers out of the extra outlets in the power strip . that s a win in my book .
i ordered this product because it was advertised to have a built in splash shield which many don t . i specifically researched and looked for one with that for my little girl . it says it has one and the picture shows it . however the actual product does not have one . i opened the package thinking it might be inside the wrapping but no it wasn t . now i m out and still have to look for another one .two days later i am adding this note on and raising my rating from one star to four stars . after i wrote the above review amazon contacted me within hours and offered me a refund even if i wanted to keep the item . i was so surprised by the generosity of that offer . amazon once again has proved itself excellent in customer satisfaction and really checked the reviews to see if they could make the situation better . i really appreciate that and love amazon all the more for it . thank you amazon .i was terribly uncomfortable and needed some support for my baby belly but this was not even close to the answer to my problem . i ll say it again because these are the only two words worthy of writing about this product terrible and pointless .we just had a new baby boy and i feel like a new mother ! my older son is now years old and boy have baby products changed since then ! i seriously considered comments and reviews when deciding which items i wanted which i could live without and what was an absolute must have . so i hope you find my review just as helpful when deciding on your purchase . i call this bottle warmer one of the best purchases we ve made so far ! i read the mixed reviews on this product before purchasing it and i m glad i ignored all the negative reviews . i quickly learned that the problem with those used wasn t the product it might have been user error . i have found this warmer to be extremely easy to use . the trick is to play with the warmer and get the water levels right before attempting to use it . so far we use it daily and it s always heated consistantly and quickly mins max . i still always shake the bottle and check the temp before giving it to my son !
i bought this product for only one reason i have several amps that are not guitar amps but stereo or pa type clean high powered two channels that i want to use as guitar amps either as the primary or backup . this tube modeler acts first as a pre amp and then adds gain volume control crunch whatever to the non guitar amps to make them sound like guitar amps . i don t really care what tube amps it models or what mic placement i just want the guitar amp sound and style . i also use it in front of a behringer ultra g di box so that the di box splits the signal coming from the tm and sends half to my non guitar amps and guitar speakers on stage and the other half to the house pa . i don t think that many people would do this .the sound you get out of this box is affected by what amp and kind of amp you are driving with it and also what kind of speakers that amp is driving . the acoustics of the space you are playing in also affects the sound but i ve used this box with all of its settings driving pa amps home stereo amps bass amps and guitar amps all of which drove pa speakers bass speakers and eminence commonwealth guitar speakers all in the same acoustic space . each combination of amp and speaker with all settings on the box held constant sound different some more like guitar amps and speakers some not . as i said i don t really care about what tube amp is being modeled only that i get an authentic guitar and speaker sound out of the box . it works for me .i read reviews that say that this is a digital knockoff of the analog sansamp gt and based on its performance so far it has served as kind of like a cheap preview of what the sansamp can do . i would consider getting the gt in the future but for now this product is for me the poor man s tube amp .this is my second condenser microphone and i have to say that i love it . i previously owned an audio technica condenser mic which sounded thin and not as natural to me . i noticed that this mic does not really boost any frequencies like some other mics do in this price range . with this microphone what you hear with your ears is basically what you get . of course room acoustics and microphone positioning all play a large part in the final sound .i use an alesis mic preamp with a focusrite i interface and the recordings sound clean . another thing to mention this is a variable pattern condenser mic . however even with all the polar patterns that this mic has to offer i usually just leave it on cardioid since i mainly use the m for vocals . although i usually only record vocals i also record electric guitar acoustic guitar and drums with the same microphone .overall my experience with this microphone has been pretty great . i think that for this price it will be hard to find another microphone that can perform on the same level .i bought this because i was going on a trip and needed an amp i could pack in my suitcase that would work with a battery .i had a similar amp before that died . the honeytone is very compact but looks cool and is very simple to operate with just three controls volume tone and gain distortion . i found that some level of distortion is necessary to have any volume . if you try playing clean with no distortion you ll be underpowered . the trick is to balance the gain and volume for your instrument and situation . i tried a regular electric guitar a lap steel guitar a slide guitar an acoustic electric guitar an acoustic electric mandolin and a silent banjo . i thought the acoustic guitar would overwhelm this little amp but i was surprised that it added to the projection and wasn t bad on the tone . it has a handy belt clip and a useless little leather handle just for looks . i am using it to play an electric instrument in jamming situations where everyone else is playing acoustic and i can adjust my volume to blend in . i think a mike with an unbalanced output phone jack would also work in here for street corner singing for instance though i haven t tried that yet as all my mikes use xlr jacks and there would be the issue of a mike stand or a lapel or headphone mike with a phone jack output which might be hard to find .overall i m very pleased with this amp and it seems sturdy and reliable so far and at a bargain .
don t know why this works for me but it does . my stomach doesn t tolerate nsaids but i was doubtful this would work . didn t work for my mom but it really eases the arthritis pain in my hands .this works well and does not bother my beta . what else can i say . . . hmm not much but i have to typeyou put it in the aquarium . it then shows you the temp . i don t know what else i could possible say .
the ones i received are not identical to the picture . one can only be installed on the side and the other can only be installed on the front or back . the markings are different for left to right level vs front to back level .i attached these to my travel trailer . this product makes it easy to level both front to rear and side to side .the install is easy just level your camper using a carpenter level of feet or longer . set the level from side to side on your smooth flooring or counter top . then set the level from front to back the same way on the smooth flooring or counter top . now position the hopkins levels one on the side you prefer to work from at the front of the camper on a flat vertical surface . do the same on a side wall near the front corner on a smooth vertical surface . use the double stick tape to position but consider adding pop rivets or small screws to hold the setting for many years . holes are provided in the hopkins levels .use the front level first to drive onto leveling ramps or boards then use the side level along with the tongue jack to finish after you unhitch . extend your stabilizer jacks and you re set for level comfortable sleeping in your camper .
my order came from the witz and sons fulfilled by amazon .i ve bought hp ink through amazon for years and never once had an issue . this time what i received was questionable .the product is advertised as being in retail packaging and the photo shows an hp package .however when i opened the amazon box what was inside was not in an hp retail box . instead the ink cartridge arrived unboxed . there was no hp cardboard box . it arrived in only the hp inner foil package . that means there was no hp box no upc and of course no explicit expiration date listed .the only thing on the package outside of the hp logo is a foil code . in my case the foil code is sg . i happen to be familiar with the codes on hp foil so reading the two sets of six numbers in yymmdd format i was able to see that what i was sent had an ink warranty that expired about months ago back in august and was produced in february of .while many people use ink past the warranty date that should be the choice of the consumer . here it seems likely the seller removed the box to try to pass off a old product as fresh which is deceitful at best .i am always wary of ordering ink for my printer online . according to reviews what is shown is not always what is received . these were factory sealed exactly as shown in the picture original canon . very happy .our printer is listed on this package however it is cleary the wrong cartridge . ours uses the which is shorter . rather than trust the package check your cartridge prior to ordering . the number is clearly visible .
it worksthey do work . exactly as advertised . hane no fear on buying these . fit the chevy silverado wt tailgate rods .if you work on peoples stuff you know what a pain in the rear trailer wiring is always non functional . this conncetor works and holds the flat wire firmly .
product works as labeled i use the big end for my big yorkie and the small for my little pound yorkie .this is my car safety harness of choice for all three of my dogs . i have a lb mixed bichon lb mini poodle and a lb mini poodle and they all wear size small . they are quite adjustable and work well an extension bought separately so the dogs can stand or lay down with comfort in the back seat of the car . without the extension only my short legged mixed bichon would be comfortable . the poodles have longer legs and would not be comfortable without an extension . tip because they all wear the same size harness but at different adjustments i have a little piece of yarn in different colors for each tied onto the harness so i know at a glance which harness belongs to which dog .i have two of these leashes i was so happy with the first one that i bought one for my car . my australian shepherd is lbs so on the low end of the suggested pound limit for large pounds but this size is by no means over kill . the extra length of the foot version gives him some roaming room . the feed out and back is very smooth . i would have liked the black color but the red is manly enough . very satisfied with amazon s shipping and cost .
i received this as a gift unforutnately it didn t fit on our stroller pretty standard graco travel system or on our carseat either our grace or our marathon and so it was pretty useless .i just bought this toy because it was the only one i could find in the store for a stroller . . and of course it won t fit on our graco stroller .so glad to have an extra car seat base for our second vehicle . easy to install and fits our snugride classic . exactly as expected .
this is very clever in the sense that you can clip the magnets to a whiteboard that lacks a ledge to hold pens .but i ve tried each of the colors and even the dark colors purple green black are so thin as to be practically invisible .the light colors yellow blue for some reason the red barely are readable either .not sure how these could help or be useful !these are retractable highlighters that are closed via a safety seal when retracted so the highlighters don t dry out . the points are rather fine and the colors are great . they have a smear guard so they don t smear the words on your pages . there s a purplish blue shade that s too dark to function as a decent highlighter in my opinion but for certain purposes it may be useful . there s no smelly odor with these and best of all they have a handy little case that holds them when they re not in use .package says just click and highlight ! love these !the eight colors are red orange yellow green aqua blue indigo blue hot pink and pink . made in china . i m a bit of a pen fanatic and love to have a wide assortment of colors and types for different purposes . i got all the different sets i could find of the sakura brand and was very happy with them . this set includes lime deep purple coral orange yellow aqua magenta red marina blue and pink . all colors are fluorescent tones . note that these are my descriptions of the colors not theirs . these pen cases are clear and have a shiny colored cap that indicates the ink color which is imprinted with a crescent moon and one star . the ink is matte and vivid and goes on very smoothly .
it says this will fit my powerhead from the same company but i seriously just can t figure out how . i have tried every modification possible and have looked at diagrams online and on the directions included and googled and youtubed . nothing . . . so its just sitting in my cabinet waiting for a magical hand to make it fit on there .minimal instructions doesn t even tell how to install the batteries ! really ? the company can t even paste a photo of how to open the weird battery compartment ? ?revision oops . correct battery compartment door was partly covered by a label saying don t immerse in water . i had been trying to open the door covering the circuit assembly on the bottom which looked just like a battery compartment door ! fairly easy to install the batteries once i found the correct door ! still this is the first product i ve ever seen without any kind of indication of where to put the batteries .the instructions also say something about a beeper function again the instructions don t say how . i called customer care who was prompt polite and helpful and they confirmed this is a feature not enabled on this product .update have used it for a few months no problems . i use it to give my dog meds when i m at work by mixing the pills in a gob of peanut butter . occasionally he spits out a pill but that s not a major problem or the fault of the feeder .momentary rant when you manufacture a product outside of this country how much does it cost to show the respect to your customers of having the instructions properly written and translated ?everything is accurate just make sure you follow instructions per the manual . if you don t shake properly it can greatly change the results . that being said my only qualm is the fact that in the nitrate testing color chart the and ppm look like the same color .
prosi ve never leaked .it s really thin .consit feels like plastic .it does not allow my skin to breathe and make my breasts really itchy .it won t stick to your bra . the small sticky tab doesn t do much .it stinks at the end of the day .yellow powder gets on your fingers if you open the wrapper wrong .lansinoh has two sticky tabs that work . and it doesn t make my breasts itchy or sweaty . and their wrappers do not have any weird coloring on it .it doesn t stick to everything and it s not good on round tables or if there s a tablecloth obviously but it does help keep her food off public tables in a variety of situations . she s not too bad about pulling it up so sometimes i could just lay it down and put something at the top to hold it and it worked ok . it also is really stained from tomato products i can t remove it .the clay that comes with the frame isn t the easiest to work with . if you don t get the clay absolutely paper smooth and flat you will get a pot marked dimpled result . however smooth you are able to roll out the clay is the way it will dry so don t think its going to change when it dries it doesn t . one print worked well the other didn t because i was unable to get the clay super smooth .
i decided to try these out and i m glad i did ! the black ones look really god in combination with the carbon fiber license plate frame i also got from amazon real carbon fiber license plate frame tag cover ffsince most plates only use two screws one set covers front and rear if you are lucky enough to live where a front plate is required the white ring mounts like a washer under your mounting screws and the black cap just snaps over the top . seems to hold well enough to not fall off but they pull of easily if you have to get to your screws . another reviewer mentioned that they trap water in and rusted his mounting hardware . that is good to know . i would suggest going with stainless steel mounting hardware just in case . which isn t a bad idea anyway very quick and easy mounting and really adds to the look of the rear of the jeep . these are metal and not a cheap plastic and mount with included screws into the existing lens cover screw holes .my dealer had put a plate frame on my motorcycle when i bought it but it covered part of the info numbers and state which is not legal in nc . i liked the look and price of this one and bought it . and it looks nice and frames the plate without covering any of the info on the plate . i did have to use a snipper to cut off the top of two of the barbs to get the screws in but you can t tell .
i like the option you have of keeping it on for more than an hour all day if you d like but i wish it could be louder .it is great but is too short ! the yellow wedge is non removable and the baby outgrew it in less than months ! boo !my son spit up in his sleep for the first months so this product was wonderful . however by the time that he was months old all of my ultimate crib sheets had developed holes and cracks in the plastic backs . the product was such a life saver that i will purchase new ones maybe a different brand for future children but i really expected more than months of use out of these .
fantastic product . our child loves playing in this pack n play . even if we don t put toys inside the walls are moderately entertaining for our child . the sun has a mirror plastic kind that sort of warps images the butterfly has crinkly wings fabric with plastic inside for noise another side has a bug with wings inside and the final side has a squeaker which is really hard to use .it s all one piece so no assembly ever required . the sides are collapsible with the push of a button on each side . the ground mat that the child sits on servers as the exterior of the case that holds the pole assembly together when folded up . and there s a light plastic zipper bag with handle that serves as a carrying case . it packs up into a long rectangle probably x x feet .pros pack up or unpack in under a minute no assembly required just set it and lock it into place like a collapsible baby stroller . sturdy build child won t be able to tip it over and it would never fold on itself . soft but strong mesh walls that child can see through but can t stick fingers or small objects through mesh .cons this is a minor complaint the squeaker on one of the walls is impossible for a child to squeak you have to press it from both sides of the wall because it s sewn so tightly as a side effect of the sturdiness it s very heavy . on the plus side of that it is made of sturdy materials .this is the perfect size ! it s large enough for my year old to get both feet on comfortably but not so bulky that it gets in the way in the bathroom . it also has a really nice rubber top so it s not slippery as well as rubber grip on the bottom so it s not sliding around on the tile floors .i use this cuz my baby is too short but already active and wants to bounce etc . so i use this under his feet . later it can be used for potty training and it is also a step stool in the kitchen area for the shelves that a just a little too high for me . love this use it all the time for everything . does slide on my bamboo hardwood floors tho the antislip doesnt work perfectly with smaller weights like a baby .
i actually use this to keep the door open to the room where we keep the cat s litter box . its a subtle product and keep guests from closing the door .i use it in my indoor round stair and patio stair . to keep my child safe when walking up and down the stair . easy to install .we are buying more of these .we bought two originally to keep our door cracked and the baby room door cracked so we aren t opening and shutting doors all the time . it s just enough to let the crying noise through but not the lights from the rest of the house .they have withstood twin teething toddlers and fit our doors great . we live in a house with doors from the s .most of the bad reviews about these are on exterior doors being slammed or blown by wind . . . all i can say is they can withstand the slamming of a toddler really well .
it does what it is supposed to do that is to increase placement distance from the car to the electrical outletit does exactly what it s supposed to do . no problems whatsoever .this product will do what is says it will do . that being said it does not inspire confidence in heavy use situations . it does not appear very rugged . nice that it comes with the mount but again the mount is very thin and light and probably won t last very long . also the wire coloring does not match with the standard us codes . white is ground on the item while in most cases in the us black is the ground wire . where was this thing made ? again it is a good price and a useful product but just beware it might be very rugged or reliable . make sure to read the enclosed documentation so that you match your wiring correctly .
i use this for my portable changing pad and under the sheet in my daughters cradle . it is a bit wide for my cradle so i just tuck in the sides . it is wide for the portable changing pad but still works good !these changing pad covers are of poor quality and have not held up very well to washings . in addition the covers do not fit the changing pad very well and pull up at the sides . unfortunatly there does not seem to be any other choices so i still use the covers but i also lay a waterproof multi use pad over the top . this way i just change the multi use pad and i don t have to wash the changing pad cover very often .why didn t they make these covers with slits in the side for the safety straps the changing pads have ? the maker of this product simmons also made the coordinating contoured changing pad we use so that design flaw just doesn t make sense .these pads are soft and do wash well and do fit and stay put on the coordinating changing pad but i would recommend not using pads of this type at all for everyday . we use these covers as cover ups only when guests are coming and we want the changing pad to look new and pretty .just change your baby on the uncovered vinyl pad itself so that you can use the safety straps and can also clean the changing pad with antiseptic or other wipes after messy changes or when your baby boy wets all over it .or put a coordinating flannel blanket folded in quarters down on the pad for baby s head and shoulders to rest on if you think the pad s vinyl is too cold for middle of the night changes . the blankets are cheaper easier to clean and don t interfere with the use of the safety straps .
a number of reviewers have commented that the accuracy of this gauge is . psi . it isn t . the accuracy spec is . psi of the reading . this means that the gauge could show anything between . to . for a tire actually filled to psi .long story short . . .don t believe that digit number that s being displayed . if there s a slight change in tire pressure it ll show it but the actual value can vary significantly from what s shown .after a power outage i connected my refrigerator to this power supply . sadly its inverter was unable to support my refrigerator . the duracell dpp hd doesn t have enough momentary output to handle the initial start up current spike of a refrigerator s compressor motor . the specifications say it can momentarily provide up to watts . this equates to amps at v . yet public benchmark figures for a home refrigerator s start up current indicate amps for up to second . other appliances that use electric motors such as sump pumps are likely to exhibit the same characteristics . my suggestion is that customers immediately test this product with any device they intend to power during an outage .some important specifications are missing in the amazon listing . one of the key statics is the capacity of the internal battery which is amp hours at v . this equates to watt hours . yet ac output is much lower than this presumably due to inverter losses . these losses increase with power output . the following table illustrates this . the last column is my calculation .load . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .watts . . . .hours . . . .watt hourscordless

with power consumption . ultimately the usable energy is significantly less than what is contained within the lead acid battery .for reference a refrigerator will use about watts of electricity when the compressor is running . typical consumers will have their refrigerator running about to of the time which equates to an average of watts being consumed continuously .consdoesn t handle current spikes associated with certain electric motorsprosboth ac and dc outputportablesimple operationanother reviewer mentioned this charger puts out . v in agm mode and that s too many volts for some agm batteries and it caused his to outgas reducing the battery s life . my optima yellow top agm battery is rated for v charging so i thought this charger would be okay for it but the charger i got puts out . v ! i did find specs that say . v regulated voltage is okay for rapid charging on my battery but they don t define what rapid charging means . they do say with . v to charge until current drops below amp which i think means you can do . v until the battery gets closer to being charged and stops accepting high amperage . unfortunately this charger does the exact opposite starting at lower voltage and increasing to . v around when it decides the battery is at charge which seems to equate to about . or . v on my battery . the charger keeps outputting . v until the battery is fully charged which may take hours so it seems unlikely that s good for most batteries and i m pretty sure it s against the charging specs on my battery . note that the charger shows . v on its readout but my volt meter shows it s actually . v .nevertheless i let it keep doing . v and checked periodically to make sure the battery wasn t hot it never even felt warm and an ir temperature gun read f max and wasn t hissing hissing would mean it was overcharged and releasing gas permanently reducing its life . it took almost exactly hours for the charger to decide it was charged and go into maintenance mode but when it did it picked . v ! agm batteries are supposed to be charged at around . v for maintenance float charging so i have no idea why it picked . v . i left it on for another hour and it actually reduced the voltage to . at which point i took it off the charger . volt meter said the battery was at . v .i can t decide if this charger is broken has a weird charging algorithm or is actually very smart . i say that because my battery was discharged to about . v a few weeks ago well below the voltage it s designed to be discharged to it s a deep cycle but even deep cycles don t tolerate discharging below and even below . v may hurt them so it s now damaged and won t hold the full . v it s supposed to . instead if i leave it on the charger at . v for an hour it hits . v and then quickly loses charge to . v in about minutes . so maybe the charger somehow figured that out and decided that . v was full charge on my damaged battery so that s what it used as its float charge . i don t see how it could determine that if the battery was . v or higher after the long . v charge but who knows .i also don t know if . v is really bad for my battery or for the average agm . i spent awhile researching but couldn t find any real authoritative information just a bunch of people theorizing . since it s above the v standard charge on the battery spec sheet i don t think it s a good thing but then again i also found research nrel dot gov vehiclesandfuels energystorage pdfs evs pres .pdf showing that seriously overvolting a yellow top battery to v under certain conditions actually increases its life . so i don t know what to think but i m leaning towards thinking it s a bad thing to go against the manufacturer s spec sheet unless you re in a lab using specialized chargers .what i do know is that the desulfination feature on this charger didn t do a thing for my damaged battery . in fact i don t think it even kicked in . i connected the charger to a small sealed lead acid battery that i left unused for too long and it went into desulfination mode i think the manual doesn t say how you re supposed to know for over hours pumping . v into the battery until it said bad bat on its screen and stopped charging . in all that time the battery never showed over charged on the charger though it did end up holding about . v . in my online research it was mentioned in a few places that there are no studies showing desulfination actually works so i m pretty dubious about it . it definitely didn t work on either of my batteries .it was also interesting to note that the sealed lead acid battery never got warm which i find rather curious considering how long it was putting in such a high voltage . i had the charger connected to a kill a watt meter and it showed the charger was pulling only . amps and watts and this is in amp charging mode so maybe the charger is smart enough to use low amperage when it s using high voltage and that prevents the battery from getting damaged . when it was pushing . v to my agm battery it was only drawing . amps and it actually reduced the amps to . as it got closer to charged . so maybe that protects the battery from overvoltage damage but i don t know enough to be sure . maybe a battery expert will chime in in the comments .another important thing to consider is that desulfination mode could damage your car s electronics if you don t remove the battery from the car to charge it . . v is more than most cars were designed to handle and i found someone mentioning that bmw warns not to use chargers that do things like that so it s definitely a concern . i don t know if i feel comfortable using this charger again without removing the battery from the car . some chargers claim to somehow magically detect the presence of car electronics and limit their voltage but this charger says nothing about that in its manual .other than all that the design of the charger is nice . wires fit into a pocket beneath the retractable handle . it will show you the battery voltage on its readout until you tell it to start charging although it reads . to . v lower than my volt meter which is annoying . a button lets you toggle between display of voltage or battery percent . it lets you choose standard agm and gel cell and choose from three rates of charge . the slower a charge rate is supposed to be better for many batteries so use a or a if you aren t in a hurry . i tried both those modes and it still puts out . v in a mode but it puts out . v in a mode .since this is a dedicated v charger you don t have to worry about it autodetecting actually auto misdetecting your discharged v battery as a v and never charging it past v which is a problem with far too many chargers these days .despite its nice controls and smart form factor i give this charger a low rating because i think it tries to push some batteries beyond their limits in the name of charging them as quickly or as fully as possible . one reviewer said it caused his agm to outgas and another said it burnt out his battery after a few months of trickle charge mode . if you have the right brand of battery that can handle this charger s output and your battery isn t damaged it s probably fine but the fact that it can damage things and may even damage car electronics in desulfination mode strikes me as very bad design especially given that desulfination seems like more of a marketing ploy than a valuable feature . i also don t like that its volt meter reads . to . v under actual voltage .
not much to say they are what they are and at a great price ! these are high quality and i only use the best in my subaru impreza wrx sport wagon . these filters are made by a well known manufacturer and have great quality but the price is lower than buying the manufacturers equivalent name brand . excellent quality .i chose stars because of the quality of the product . it is durable and the welds are clean . i do recommend buying these hein werner jack stands because they are made in the usa . the price may be high but again would you risk your life for cheaper stands ? it may also be the type of steal and materials this company uses that makes this product expensive but worth the price .
the filament lines makes this tape almost impossible to tear it has to be cut . the adhesive is very strong without any peeling . if you need to tape a box shut and keep it shut this will do the trick !this is a continuous roll of very thin plastic and one side of it is tacky sticky . the roll is housed in a hard plastic container which has a serrated cutting device at one end . what you do is pull on the strip of thin plastic and when a sufficient amount has been exposed you sever the plastic strip from the rest of the roll by using the aforementioned serrated cutting device . i know it sounds confusing but once you do it or times you ll get the hang of it . truly remarkable new invention .my year old daughter was getting burned out on plastic rulers that slipped and broke . i bought her this because inches is long enough for almost any craft project she does she can cut against the edge and its very easy to make accurate measurements . the lines are finely engraved and filled with black paint making them quite visible and easy to measure or cut against . for extremely accurate measurements use an xacto knife perpendicular to the ruler to cut a short line on the piece . just pivot the xacto blade in the engraved lines on the ruler . when you cut or slide a scribe or pencil to these cuts you can feel them .great value great performance five stars .

i required an ammonia free window cleaner for my tinted windows . this does the job quite nicely . it isn t how well it does rather how safely it does it .i received the valve on time and it was very well packaged . i have installed the valve and it works very well on my rv hot water tank .works well
the listing for this item can be confusing if you are not sure what stereo xlr is . stereo xlr is meant to be similar to your stereo headphones where left and right are separate unbalanced wires . this cable is configured to be a stereo unbalanced xlr to a stereo unbalanced trs cable . this item is not a mono balanced xlr to a stereo unbalanced mic cable .a little bit a soldering can fix this connector by moving the red wire from ping to pin with the white wire . pin then ties to pin with the ground wire .should you need to connect a condenser microphone to a phantom power box so that it will work with an ordinary amplifier or mixer without phantom supply this is a good length for the link .works great no issues . bought this to adapt the mike plug to jack so the mike can plug into a regular amp for the grandkids to karaoke with .
not all kits include scissor digital thermometer tweezer etc . this is one does . the compact pouch securely holds everything in place which is great for traveling . great value !this kit has all the essentials . great for travel . roomy case to add first aid stuff . a must have .this stroller frame is easy to use light folds nicely has a big storage basket and navigates well . i highly recommend getting this to use with your infant carrier vs . a travel system .
let s face it i m sure there are better compressors than this for about to times the price but this brought my amp into the light . bright crisp clean balanced sound reproduction . got the danelectro wall wart for it . worked great . the free shipping was lighting fast and i got more than i bargain for . get one !i bought this tuner for my mandolin . i have to play a little louder than i d like for the tuner to hear me . the display is not as nice or easy to interact with as some tuning displays i ve seen . but it s so small that i never have to take it off and it s doing its job well . i m pretty fond of this little guy .wow i got more than i expected from this chromatic tuner sure it s a plastic case but who would be rough on a pedal anyways had it about weeks now and im impressed i see people say the blue indicator light is too bright but truthfully its ok because the tuner lights are plenty bright enough if it is too bright for you just put a little piece of black tape over the light but like i said its ok cause you can still see the tuner lights i use this pedal with thevisual sound one spot combo pack works like a charm .
the easy peel feature makes it easier to get the labels off the sheet . you bend the page in half and then back again . the product is fool proof . the tricky parts are doing the mail merge into the word processor .the templates come with microsoft word and wordperfect . at the website they have templates for image processing software too .if you have a specific question make a comment and i will figure out the answer .the biggest plus for the avery file folder labels is avery s trueblock technology which layers a semi opaque gray layer to the back of the label allowing it to hide most anything you may put it on top of . i know that for a lot of the labels i have i have to remove anything underneath as they ll show right through . for this alone the avery labels are great .other than that they re normal looking labels that are sized to put on tab type file folders . unlike a different style of avery label i reviewed earlier microsoft word did not have a template for these . avery s web site has several options including an mb program that runs independent of word . a smaller helper toolbar for word doesn t support word . at the basic level a .doc file is provided which you can open in word and fill it in but this means you can t take advantage of automation features such as mail merge etc . this is not a fault of the labels themselves but if you re going to use these you might want to know .the instructions for the labels say to not reuse the sheet though it seems to work anyway for at least a few passes .i ve been using avery s product to make return address labels for some time now but despite the increasing quaintness of postal mail i still have a few people and companies that i mail things to every so often so tried out avery s address labels for laser printers to print up some address labels . they just work .if you haven t used this type of product it s a breeze if you have almost any working version of microsoft word because word has built in templates for avery s various labels . just open or create a document type in the address you want on the label select mailings labels in word varies by version tell it that you want to use avery labels and word knows how to lay out the page and to replicate the text times to fill out a page of identical labels . or you can give word a list of addresses from a mailing list and it will lay them out to fit on the avery product .this appears to be a new generation of avery s line of labels with pop up edges to make it easier to peel each label from the page as compared to older versions which required you to bend the page or pry out each label with your fingernails . amazing how it s possible to improve even a seemingly mundane product .anyway these just work and i don t even think about them when creating or using them which to me is the definition of usefulness and quality .
this stand easily supports my poundfender frontman r watt x inch guitar combo ampat any height setting . in fact even extended to the highest the this stand supports that amp with no issues from the center of gravity or weight distribution of the amplifier .i love the ease of setting up and breaking down this stand . it is essentially three parts the base and two removable arms . granted that this is heavy but the added weight is there because this thing is built like a tank .in addition to being rock solid the parts mate perfectly with no slop in tolerances . the support arms slide into the base with no friction or excess movement and the height adjustment has three nicely spaced positions . you merely pull back on the spring loaded knobs to release the safety pins that engage the arms for position . once you line up the holes release the knobs and the pins solidly engage and hold the amp in place .my only complaint and it is more of a wish is the tilt of the stand is at a fixed angle . i would love it if i could adjust that too but i am sure that it would drive up the price of the stand . one final note these significantly increase the footprint of an amp on stage . specifically it increases the depth dimension by nearly of my frontman r although the difference in length is nominal . i mention this so you can factor that in if you normally play small venues with cramped stages .overall this is an excellent stand and one that is stable and heavy duty . at the current price at the time of this review it s a bargain .this bench is well constructed and comfortable to sit on for extended periods . my only complaint is that i wish it had just a little more height adjustment maybe inch . overall it is well suited for most unless you are tall or a small child .i have mine attached to one of the support arms on myon stage ks xx pro double x keyboard stand . while this attachment is designed for both square and round tube supports i was unable to use it with anon stage tier folding z keyboard standeven with the top tier removed . the reasons for the problem with the latter stand is the friction fitting on the attachment bar was too small for the oblong support tube and had it mated the height of the attachment bar would not have cleared the top of the keyboard .when attached to theon stage ks xx pro double x keyboard standwith anon stage msa tb adjustable microphone boom blackattached to the top screw in post that perfectly mates with the boom this attachment bar boom combination easily clears the height of either keyboard i use aroland rd nx digital stage pianoor aroland v combo key stage keyboard .bottom line make sure your stand can accommodate this attachment bar according to the manufacturer it will work with most x style stands and carefully measure the height of the top of your keyboard from the center of the support arm to which this attachment bar will be inserted . the total height of the attachment bar after insertion is approximately . . if your keyboard is still too high for the attachment bar boom or other mic holder to clear you can gain an additional with ashure a x mic mount extension tube .
i put one of these lights in the lamp above my reptile tank on with hours a day of use it burned out on . it gave out very good illumination and heat for basking so my lizards enjoyed it . however unless the second one in this package convinces me the first one was just a fluke i m going to avoid this brand of pet products . i don t want to rely on something that will fail in such a short amount of time .i live in michigan and it gets cold in the winter . i have cats and dog . one cat is older thin with thin fur so i thought i would try this out as i didn t want a plug in item . this particular cat sleeps in a cat bed on top of a bunk bed . at first i only heated it for minutes and wasn t impressed then i found the wattage of my microwave watts and saw that it could go in for minutes . that made quite a difference . it did come with a fleece cover which i always leave on but i still put it under some fleece wrap and my cat loves it . she always sleeps on it at night . during the day if i remember i will put it under a blanket on the couch and she and another cat will sleep on it . i tried it with my dog but he wasn t interested . i purchased a second one and have to admit that i stick it in bed with me . i often have to fight my daughter for it . makes the sheets nice and warm .now if it isn t put under some type of cover besides its fleece covering it will cool much faster . and many times i have taken it out of the microwave and thought this isn t hot but as i ve had it in my bed with me it can get painfully hot so even if you think it isn t warm it is still giving off a lot of heat .i can t be sure but i would think a lot of the negative comments are people who didn t have it heated right knowing the wattage of your microwave is important and not having it covered to retain the heat longer .i want to get a third one but winter is pretty much over so i ll wait till fall again .these are a great alternative to day night heating bulbs and they last longer . at night this works well because the red night light was keeping my fiance awake so i switched . i now use them on out of of my turtle tanks . i leave them on hours so the temperature remains even . becareful when taking your light fixture off of the tank with this in it . i have scorched my carpet in places .
this is my second sm in years ! what s the difference between the and the ? the is made in mexico . there is a noticeable difference in tone with the with the on off switch . i did not buy that one if feedback is an issue in your practice space get the one with the switch otherwise opt out for better clarity .i say go for it ! ! save .there is almost no difference between this and the snark sn and by that i mean the design flaws . you have to constantly adjust the neck to get a reading and they eat batteries like crazy . the snark sn is far superior .tested this on my blue yeti usb microphone and could tell the difference with the pop filter on right away . good investment .
they do work . exactly as advertised . hane no fear on buying these . fit the chevy silverado wt tailgate rods .works just like it needs to . perfect fit for the tailgate on my chevy when the oem clip busted .fit my nissan frontier s oil pan perfectly . looks to be of nice quality . torque to ft lbs on the frontier anyway 
these are quality labels that yield a professional look . they also have a perforated backing paper that bends making them easier to remove from the sheets . if you re looking for a really small no nonsense label that sells with plenty in a pack this product might be for you .however i personally feel they re a little too small for practical use . it s difficult to fit more than three lines of text on this size label and still have it be large enough to read . the typical return address is three to four lines . the largest i can make the common font times new roman is . point in order to fit three lines of text on a label . fitting four lines requires going down to only . . a typical font size is to point . while there s nothing wrong with these labels i prefer using shipping labels as return address labels . using a larger sized label allows users to fit four lines of text a larger font size or even a piece of clip art . while this small size is functional and fuss free and one print yields an impressive labels legibility is sacrificed when labels are this small .these address labels are easy to use but they are very small . had to use pt font to fit the address in the label . definitely could not add a picture or graphic to the label because there isn t room . easy to peel and economical because so many fit on a page .the sell feature on these labels is that they are easy to peel but they could be much more versatile were they larger and allowed for design . the template is most basic and while the small size gives you labels per package i d rather have larger designable labels . as they are i can only fit three lines of text if i use size font ! improvements can allow for a template that accepts icons avatars so that one could design according to company logo season falling leaves snowflakes event birthday balloons or holiday jack o lanterns bunnies cornucopia . i d rather use the pre printed friendly cheerful colorful labels that i receive from charitable orgs .
d addario strings are not my usual strings i have always used ghs and ernie ball strings .to my surprise d addario strings are very nice however after years of ghs and ernie ball strings it s tough for me to make a full time change over to d addario strings .this is an indispensable tool for all guitarists who constantly change strings . it is like the swiss army knife for string winding .the small e string and the g string both broke on the ball end while tuning . i haven t broke a string while tuning in years never ever had one break on the ball end .luckily i bought the three pack .but i can t recommend this product .
we love this product so much we bought a second unit . our cat gained tons of weight while being free fed . now we can control when she eats have it supply a meal at a .m . so she s not howling at us to feed her in the morning and then we have the second feeder open at noon . we feed her wet food by hand at night . the problem i had with the other types of gravity units is that cup is the minimum allowable . we need to feed her less than cup in each of the two daily dry feedings and this unit allows you to put as little or as much kibble as needed . i have not had any of the problems the other reviewers stated cat being able to push the tray for another feeding tray not turning etc . the only complaint i have is that the instructions are not that clear and there are no additional trays to purchase while one is in the dishwasher . i bought the second unit so that i just have to fill the trays every four days instead of every two . to clarify the instructions just plug in the time of day when the feeder is to open . i thought originally that you had to program it for each of the five trays to open . so one unit has one time plugged in for am instead of five am s and the other has noon plugged in once . tray rotates whatever time s you set not just and hour periods . hope that helps .we ve had this for about two weeks and it works great . the unit holds a ten pound bag of dry food which will last anywhere from a couple weeks to a month depending upon how many pets you are feeding with it much longer than the typical meal automatic feeders which just aren t sufficient if you plan to be away for more than a week .although this feeder costs a little more than the rest it is worth it . the build quality was much better than expected and the feeder comes with a long jacketed a c power cord which should discourage your pets from chewing on the power cord .the unit uses an electrically driven horizontal auger to dispense food . a timer controls when and how long the motor is on . the auger doesn t turn very fast for our two cats it has to run seconds to dispense the correct amount of food for each meal . the auger motor is fairly quiet though you can hear food fall into the bowl if you are nearby . the timer is a bit bulky about square and plugs directly into a wall outlet . the timer has two outlets on it one that is timed for the pet food bowl and a spare outlet that is always on . the plug for the feeder fits tightly into the timer s outlet . at first i didn t think i liked the timer being a separate unit instead of built into the feeder but now that i ve thought about it i think it was a great idea because you can program the timer while sitting at the kitchen table . also the power cord only has power in it when the pet food bowl is actually dispensing food so there is much less chance that your pet will chew through the cord and shock himself . plus with the timer located away from the feeder your pet is less likely to paw at the timer and accidentally press a button .you can program up to eight on and eight off events which can be set to daily specific days alternating days etc . you will need to be careful when programming it though to make sure that your off times are just a few seconds or a minute or so past the on time . otherwise you could accidentally have the timer set to dispense food for several hours straight . you set timer events in weekdays hours minutes and seconds for both the on time and the off time for each event . a better solution would have been to set the on time and then set the duration time in minutes seconds but this is no big deal . you will probably have to experiment with the cycle times a bit to get them set so that you are feeding your pet the right amounts each day . for our two cats we have our timer set to feed about every . hours four times per day for about seconds each time starting at am and ending about pm . the timer has an internal battery so i assume it would recover after a power outage but i haven t tested this . there is a button on the timer that will cycle the unit between on feed off and auto on timer and auto off ? ? . you can press this button to initiate a manual feed for a few seconds if needed . you need to be careful when pressing it though because when you stop the manual feed you should press it a couple times until the display shows auto on or else the timer will not automatically start the feeder . other than the couple of quirks i mentioned it s a great automatic pet feeder .we bought this to use to feed our two adult cats whenever we go out of town for a few days . we chose this model because it was reasonably priced and holds enough food for up to six days . the unit has six pie shaped wedge sections that you fill with food one section is always exposed so it basically holds food for today plus five more servings . there is a switch that lets you select between or hour serving intervals . at the preset interval the lid advances to the next section . each section holds enough dry food forup to two cats if you fill them up . there is no clock display on the unit there is a manual advance button on the unit whenever you press this the lid rotates to the next opening and it resets the timer so that it will advance at the preset interval after this or it will advance at the preset interval after you install the battery one volt alkaline battery . there are some small water tanks on the botton that are intended to be filled with water and frozen to keep canned food cold but they are useless after more than a few hours . overall the unit does what it is supposed to do very well without any complicated clock or timer settings to worry about and it is large enough to hold a few days worth of food .
i was surprised at just how large this tub was when i received it . literally my year old can take a bath in it . he loves it and calls it his boat . it is really sturdy . it has both positions for infant and toddler so really can last a long time . if you are not looking for something large this is not the tub for you if you have a smaller infant which i always do i would think adding a sponge insert will help to allow even the smallest baby to fit .we love it !after looking at several different variations my husband and i decided to go with this one . the cushioning on the kneeler is awesome and i also really like the elbow rest .the hanging organizer has two pockets which fit our daughters bathwash and bubble bath . we use a new washcloth at each bathing so this is really all we need to hold .what i liked most about this product was that it grows with your child so they can use it as a stepstool as they get older . for the price i think its the best choice out there . mom and dad can use it we actually bought it for grandma who loves to bathe our daughter but has an ackward time doing it in our tub and then our daughter can use it to brush her teeth or to stand in the kitchen .the maximum weight on this product is pounds so i think its a good product for adults as well who maybe need a little extra help reaching that top shelf in the kitchen !i had originally registered for another tub bit it was a major dissapointment . it leaked and it was not a good size for my little man . i needed a tub that would be good for my very small son . i decided on this tub and i have to say i am very happy . this tub comes with a sling that can be used while they are newborn and thenyou can remove it and then use the tub in the other two positions that is made for . great tub and worth every penny my son loves to take his baths in this since the sling makes him feel safe . the other tub he cried like life as we know it was ending .
could a wheel chock chock is a wheel chock could chock wheels ?in this case .good build quality worked well on my ag tires on the rear of the tractor .very goodvery good . . . .
the paper quality is good and there is a wide variety of templates to choose from on the avery web site . the templates range from wedding invitations to get well cards to office oriented announcement cards . you have to provide the actual text but the background images are part of the templates . you can also design and print your cards via their web site it generates a pdf file that you print one side at a time . helpful instructions are close by . the templates on the web site are for all versions of microsoft word i had no trouble opening them with openoffice .org software .these are very good quality cards that can be printed for any purpose thank you invitation x mas cards etc . etc . although the box says that they are for inkjet printers i have used them in dell brother samsung laser printers without any problem .but i did need to download the template from the microsoft office web site . the template also works for iwork pages in mac just open the template from the file menu in pages . then i found out that avery has software providing templates for all its products at its web site . the software is designpro for mac and wizard for microsoft office on windows and is available for free download at avery web site . as of july each card and envelope comes to about cents a card . not bad .bottom line good product saves from running to store each time you need a different kind of card and then you can also customize the card .this product consists of decent quality . x matte card stock with a partial laser perforation in the middle so the it folds in half evenly . envelopes are included in the package . this is larger than a typical greeting card but the size makes it easy to use with just about any printer . the paper accepts and absorbs the ink without seeping through or veining in the paper fibers . the paper color is not bright white but is appropriate for a greeting card .the package insert dated states that avery designpro software is windows only . however avery designpro for mac osx is now available as a free download on the avery .com software page . avery designpro for mac is a basic graphic design and layout program which includes templates for most avery products including avery american greetings half fold blank cards . this is the easiest way i know of to use this kind of product . in addition avery designpro includes a printer calibration feature . absolute precision is not so critical on greeting cards but if you re printing per page return address labels a fraction of an inch one way or the other can run a whole sheet of labels .my printer an hp has a duplex two sided printing attachment . the designpro software will print both sides on the same job . the trick is to choose short edge binding in the print dialog box . if you choose long edge the inside of the card will print upside down on the wrong page . the preview in the print dialog box does not show the inside page but it does print . if your printer does not have a duplex attachment then you simply print page only flip the paper over and then print page only . i d suggest trying this once or twice with plain paper so you know exactly how to flip the paper for your particular printer .to me these products fall in the etiquette scale between a hand written note on your personal letterhead and a greeting card you bought in the grocery store . they do show you put some time and effort into the communication .
my medicare card was fraying . . .thanks to this system i didnt have to buy a machine and it protects cards pics etc so those old pics in your wallet or car can be protected too .this is a great size for a holiday letter card where you can print a photo on the cover and your letter on the inside works easier if your printer does doublesided automatically .nice heavy duty security envelope that has a self sealing edge and does exactly what it is advertised to do .
this is a great portable uke stand to have with you . it folds up small and will fit in the outside pocket on your uke gig bag . having this stand is a lot better than just laying your uke on the floor .this a very clever idea . it helps save floor space in your rooms and it helps cover empty wall space . very easy to take off put on . high recommend this to any stringed instrument players .this is great if you have to put your guitar down but don t want to put it in its case .
this kit has everything you need to test the most important freshwater parameters . easy to follow instructions make testing quick and easy . comes in a nice storage container too . stop the guess work and get one of these !this is a great filter . however it is incredibly complex to assemble and the directions are incredibly complex .i had to hire someone to assemble it . maintenance is complicated to learn how to do as well .it works great .this is a simple thermometer that is easy to use and easy to read . it does exactly what i need it to do . no complaints here .
i was under the impression that the liner collapsed as baby was drinking but that is not the case so i m not sure how this system is any different than a normal empty bottle .the only thing it makes easier is cleaning since i can just drop the liner in the garbage and use another one next time .this keeps all the items i need for a diaper change in one place . i love how organized this makes me feeli like the diaper champ because it doesn t use specific bags . i don t like how easily it gets backed up though . i have to frequently push down the center to get it to rotate much before it needs to be changed .
this is rods with a connector for the center with suction cups .it works great . bubbles are very evenly distributed and i have a betta who enjoys surfing the bubble wall .this simple piece of plastic drives my cats to gleeful distraction . the screw off tops of plastic cartons are also a big hit but these loops are easier to launch which cats love to do . you know a toy is a favorite when you find it hidden in favorite kitty hiding spots . . .a corpse to be resurrected later . bottom line ? inexpensive and popular .my kitty loves these treats . they are like kitty crack . also the container makes a nice sound when shaken which my kitty has learned to come to .
this holds a fairly large bag of dog food enough for two pugs for one month . it fits into a narrow cabinet . very convenient .this is the perfect sized chuckit for my maltese puppy . he can fit the balls in his mouth which he cannot do with most because of their size . even though it s a mini launcher it still sends the ball a fair ways especially for a small dog .this is my car safety harness of choice for all three of my dogs . i have a lb mixed bichon lb mini poodle and a lb mini poodle and they all wear size small . they are quite adjustable and work well an extension bought separately so the dogs can stand or lay down with comfort in the back seat of the car . without the extension only my short legged mixed bichon would be comfortable . the poodles have longer legs and would not be comfortable without an extension . tip because they all wear the same size harness but at different adjustments i have a little piece of yarn in different colors for each tied onto the harness so i know at a glance which harness belongs to which dog .
i have a cat and i actually use this to keep my cat off of things . works great for when my cat starts to scratch our couch or whatever . you just spray on whatever you want them to stop messing with and they run away .my cats love them but the onl problem is my cat keeps me up playing with them if they are stuck in a corner or something but she loves themmy cat loves to carry them around and hide them under the sofa and bed . great stocking stuffer for cats .
i bought this product as a dog gate for my boston terrier puppy . i love the step feature . our other gate i was having to step over each time and it was a real pain . this gate is also quite tall which is nice . the installation was simple and unlike the gates that drill into the wall this gate does not leave holes and can be moved easily . great gate great value !my neighbor gave me first years hands free gates that were from when her year old daughter was young but they needed the extensions and i was worried i wouldn t be able to get them since the gates were older . these fit perfectly . they don t compromise the sturdiness of the gate at all and blend in nicely with the rest of the gate .we bought two of these extensions for the hands free gate that we use for our triplets that just turned a year old . this gate including extensions are a lifesaver ! you can read my review on the gate as well lol . the extensions are very easy to add and very sturday . adding them does not make the gate weaker by extending it out like some gates do . it is just what it states an extension . it keeps it just as strong as sturdy ! worth the money !
its tape !scotch magic tape is the only kind of tape i buy . i have used cheaper tapes . they pale in comparison . magic tape is virtually invisible when applied . it is sturdy yet able to be sliced with a fingernail when you need to adjust the length of the tape on the fly . cheap tapes just twist and crumple . no frustration with magic tape . did i mention that it is the only kind of tape i buy ? !tape its tape velcro tape to stick things on walls and doors and yadda yadda yadda . . .thats it done 
i use the quick filters in my water dragon enclosure . i love the quick filter for quick change outs . it doesn t get much easier .i love the fact that you can change the media to your liking and the needs of the tank s environment . that is what sold it for me . i am not against filter cartridges its just that i like the time in between having to change the media and the ease of maintenance . the flow of water is smoother than another brand which i ll keep unnamed . who needs the hood of the tank saturated with water all of the time especially with the most likely lights installed there .overall this is an easy to set up optional media configuration based sturdy and very effective hob filter . the clear case is a definite plus as it allows you to visually inspect and makes it easier to clean . there was a little noise at first setup but what do you expect from a fish tank with a hob filter ? that noise which wasn t that bad had subsided quite a bit in just under a week .you can t go wrong with this purchase . the bio media is very effective and the filter runs very smooth without excessive splash . other benefits are easy to load media and reduced media change requirements as compared to other typical hobs . extend the foam and biomax recommended replacement cycles rinse foam in tank water and do the same with the biomax just inspect for deterioration .i own two of these filters for some of my turtles . they are not as loud and you can adjust the flow rate . the tubes clog easily but all you need to do is knock the gunk out which is not bad . i found that rinsing the cartridges once a month can help increase their longevity . i defiantly recommend them for fish or turtles .
fit my nissan frontier s oil pan perfectly . looks to be of nice quality . torque to ft lbs on the frontier anyway they do work . exactly as advertised . hane no fear on buying these . fit the chevy silverado wt tailgate rods .even though amazon says it does not fit my truck it does fit my chevrolet hd crew cab with . l gas engine . i replaced both sensors and harness . both sensors were rough looking and the rear sensor had standing water on it . it was a little bit of a chore to get to them because you have to remove the intake but it was not too bad .
i recently bought a hyundai tucson loaded to the gills and was astonished at how impossibly wimpy the single note factory horn was . leather seats nav panoramic sunroof bluetooth backup camera kick ss sound system with subwoofer and ipod integration etc . all kinds of toys . yet the factory horn sounds almost as robust as the horn in the vw bus my family had when i was a kid . meep meep . note i said the hyundai horn was almost as robust as the vw . i think the vw horn had a little more oomph . what was hyundai thinking ? ?i found a hyundai tech to swap the original hyundai kia p .o .s . horn with this item and the results are awesome . my first ever new car mod and it worked out great .the k n kn c harley davidson buell high performance oil filter not only works for me it works for the birds there is a red cardinal that likes to see her image in the reflection of the filter .this product made my dodge ram quad cab run quieter . this product seems to flow through the engine with ease . thank you
five stars because it works on my digitech gnx guitar processor which requires volts and about milli amps . this has an output of milli amps . for electronics the voltage has to be correct . but an appliance will only draw as many amps current as it needs . so this adapter is coasting when used with the guitar processor and can be used with other devices that draw up to the mamps . just be sure your v device doesn t require more than the ma this can deliver . but it s a power adapter i cannot be in love with a power adapter .very simple device to connect a quality dynamic microphone or instrument using a direct box to the usb input of a computer . i plugged in my mic and plugged the cable into my pc . win automatically searched for and found the drivers in about three minutes . i then recorded some vocals using audacity a free open source download . recording was whisper quiet with no background hiss or noise at all . recording level was great not sure why some reviewers said it was too low . note that this will not provide phantom power nor does the item description imply that it will . usb only provides vdc and phantom power usually requires vdc . unless there is some kind of power converter which would be much too large to fit in this compact package it is impossible for this or any similar sized cable to provide the higher voltage that phantom power requires . use this with a dynamic mic or direct box and if you use it correctly you will be very happy !it s a well build daisy chain dc power cable . it has good lenght between two plugs . you won t have difficulties to plug your pedals .
we ve had one of these installed on one seat for a few years and the condition of the seat without the seat protector versus the one with the seat protector is obvious . this works .there are two drawbacks however the protector doesn t go high enough up the back . there is still lots of wear on the seat back because of the lack of protection there . this is the biggest disadvantage for me . it makes the seat slipperier . tight installation of the carseat is more difficult to achieve although that may be less problematic with newer carseat latch system . i do have the best method for tightening those seats that still use straps for installation . if you have the captain style chairs install the seat tightly with the chair reclined and then push that seat back up as far as possible and your carseat will not budge not even a millimeter and the slipperiness of the seat protector is moot .this protector does the job on preventing dents in leather seats .remember that these days any type of professional is afraid of a lawsuit and do not want to use any type of aftermarket product that could interfere with their professional installation . that is why no one will approve these mats or even cupholders on strollers anymore ! ! !as a carseat safety fanatic and being pretty educated on carseat installations i felt confident that i could make a decision if this was inhibiting a proper installation . i see no problems . to be sure the carseat is strapped in super tight i sit in it as i pull the straps . it doesn t budge one centimeter left or right or front to back .this saver was easy to put in the car and did not need to be adjusted a million times as i tightened in the carseat using latch tether we use the britax marathon . a previous saver bunched and made installation impossible but this one is very thin firm and stays put . the add on back was the perfect height and did not block the tether strap in our f . it also stayed upright as i put the carseat into place .this blends in nicely with our black seats and looks good . it s available in three colors black tan and grey . let s face it if you re interested in this product it s because you care how things will look long term !this saver is a great combo of safety and function . while it may not perform perfectly with every single carseat car combination if your seat is moving more than an inch in any direction it s not installed correctly whether you are using seat saver or not !i ve only used the infant car seat part so far . very sturdy material easy to install . it s a bit wide though so it might interfere with the seat belts next to it especially if you re using the middle seat . i haven t had any issues with the saver causing the car seat to slide . it has an non sliding mat at the bottom that helps maintain it in place . overall this seat saver does the job of protecting my car and it s amongst the better products i ve seen for it . great price from amazon don t regret this purchase .
this unit folds up so small and flat that i love it for taking to presentations . the only caution i have is that it can get wobbly if you extend the legs to full length and the weight is not centered on the table . the legs store on the underside of the table and allows for a very compact table for a projector . fuzzy wuzzy s summary highly recommended with warm fuzzies !packaging style appearance excellent fuzzies ratingconstruction build quality excellent fuzzies ratingcompetitive pricing value average not good not bad fuzzies rating positives high build quality with good welds and smooth semi gloss black enamel coating . strong steel tubular legs can support up to pounds . if you use this as a laptop riser stand by placing a laptop on the top shelf the surface is perforated with many holes to allow for great air circulation and heat dissipation . negatives there are no negatives with this product this is an excellent solidly built steel stand that both looks attractive with its uniform semi gloss black enamel coating and can support a large computer display monitor or any other item weighing up to pounds . you can either place this on your desk or on a table or countertop e .g . some people have a computer in their kitchen to organize your computer laptop keyboard display layout better .this monitor stand weighs . pounds and has outer dimensions of . width x . depth x . height . the top shelf has surface dimensions of . width x . depth . the space underneath the shelf is . wide which is the . outer width minus the width of the two tubular legs . the space underneath the shelf has a usable height of . which is the . outer height minus the height of the tubular metal that supports the top shelf .even though this is advertised as a monitor stand i am using this as a laptop stand placing a inch laptop on top of the shelf . my computer desk already has a raised shelf where my two display monitors are positioned and my desk has an adjustable keyboard tray where my keyboard and mouse reside . i have multiple desktop and laptop computers so sometimes i place one laptop underneath this stand s shelf with its lid closed and a vga cable connecting that laptop to a larger monitor and another inch laptop sits on the top shelf of this stand . when placing a laptop on this stand where i use a separate bluetooth keyboard instead of the laptop s own keyboard the stand s perforated metal surface functions like a ventilated platform to help cool the laptop . since many laptops have their fan intake vents located underneath the laptop it is advantageous that this stand s shelf surface is a perforated metal grill to allow for great air circulation all along the bottom of the laptop . most of the other laptop riser stands are either made of flimsy plastic or metal mesh that is too thin with too much flex in the structure .but regardless of whether you need to place a large display monitor a large laptop or other item this stand serves as a simple sturdy and modern looking support .measure carefully because i did not . yes the outside measurement of the stand is inches but my laptop is also inches so rather than sitting on the desk below my monitor it sits on the legs of the stand . this means i need to be very careful with the docking station so it seats in properly . but the stand looks nice and will do for now .
when you need a phone during an emergency or power outage when you want a phone that is reliably located on the base where someone hasn t walked away with the handset this is the ideal phone ! the phone comes with a longish cord to plug into the phone base and phone jack . if you need the standard short cord to use with a typical wall mounted base there is a slot under the base to wrap the cord instead of providing a shorter second cord . i like this ! it s nice that companies are engineering with cost savings in mind ! the phone comes with pulse and tone dialing needed to use computerized dialing . finally a phone that you don t need to plug into an electrical outlet no power supply needed just a phone jack .it s just right for it s a steal .you learn that when there is a power outage the cordless will not work because the base is plugged into the electrical socket so its a good little phone to have plugged into a landline that s there when you need it even if you have a cell phone . . . .because you could have a low battery and this landline though to some out dated it sure helps in a pinch . !

the product is very fun for my daughter of months but the sound is so electronic that all of the selective instruments sound kind of the same . how hard would it have been to have actual recordings of instruments ? i guess they don t have actual instruments in china .the quality and variety of the sounds are great . there are cheaper versions but it s worth the few extra dollars to have sounds that are actually soothing as opposed to strange . it has a number of settings timed continuous combining sounds even womb sounds . there are sounds i thought would be annoying like bells but they turned out to be oddly soothing . i bought it for the womb sounds but never used it because i liked the others .the musical sounds don t sound like the real instruments they just sound like a cheap toy . also i thought each instrument would play its own melody how it would in a real orchestra . for example the horn would play the background the flute a lighter melody then all the instruments would combine to create the true melody when the orchestra button is pressed . but really each button plays exactly the same notes except with a different instrument . i was really disappointed and my daughter prefers the music buttons from her tiny love activity center . the ones on that toy are really neat .
this was my dog s first bed . it probably a good choice because he was teething and rambunctious when he was young so a more fluffy bed wouldve been destroyed but this isn t a soft bed . the bumpers are great but the bed itself is just a thin layer of fabricthe photo of this mat looks like it would be pretty padded but it isn t at all . it s quite thin . the back has vinyl dots so it s supposed to grip the crate pan but in my car it ends up sliding around with the dog on it and being bunched up . here are my comments to two claims they make in the product description luxurious plush sleeper bed for both dogs and cats not luxurious feeling maybe luxurious looking but it s just fake fur non skid backing for secure placement definitely not secureit was inexpensive so you get what you pay for . i would not buy this again .i ve got the t rex one . it doesn t feel like rubber it feels like hard plastic ! it s also pretty sharp around the edges . i m surprised at the number of star reviews . maybe it s just me but i m not giving it to me puppy cause i m afraid it might hurt his gums .

some of the negative reviews turned me off to the product but i decided to buy them anyways because i couldn t find a sliding plate cover for my gfci outlets and i didn t want our child to see us removing the easier outlet safety plugs on a regular basis .i think this product must have been improved some because the ones i bought can only be pushed in on one side and they work exactly as per the instructions . basically pushing the left button unlocks the top button and pushing on the top button unlocks the latch from the ground hole . with the top button continually depressed you need to patiently rock the plug up and down until it comes out . it s particularly frustrating if you re in a rush or otherwise tired because on the first pull or two there is very little noticeable progress . personally i feel that the tight fit is a sign of a good design and most certain to frustrate even those toddlers with good coordination .after a few weeks of regular use my husband can now remove them with one hand in a single pull . the best part is it looks like he s just tugging on the plug so our little one is unlikely to catch onto the required button sequence .too bad they cost so much relative to the plain plugs or i d consider using them everywhere since they are fairly low profile and thus inconspicuous .the size and grip of the product might make it difficult for people with large hands or who lack coordination strength in their fingers hands .my daughter has the kind that just plug in and you have to pry your fingernail down between the plug and the fixture to get the darned thing off . i have soft fingernails so it s really hard for me to do that when i want to use and outlet at her house . i got these for my house and they are much easier to use . all you do is squeeze the sides and push the top button and they pull right out . it s great because they stick out a little from the wall so you can get a much better grip on them and don t have to use your fingernails to pry them off . however it would be a challenge for a baby to get them off because he probably couldn t squeeze the sides and push the button at the same time . i m happy with the purchase . i am a year old grandma and if i can do it anyone can .update months later the sliding mechanism has loosened up considerably with use . it now slides smoothly without pinching our hands . i ve found the gate to be strong and secure it has never weakened or popped out when my son tries to stand on it . so if you buy it try rubbing some wax or something on it to help in the beginning because it was pretty dangerous at first . and also be aware that little hands can still get pinched in between the actual rungs when you re opening it . that will happen with any slotted sliding gate . some further negatives i found is that the latch is loud and it s also difficult for grandma to open and close because she has arthritis in her hands . and with it being difficult for her to do she tries repeatedly and the noise is very loud and annoying . i m always afraid she s going to wake the kids . so if you have your mom at your house a lot get something easier . it will save a lot of frustration for both of you ! i ve had this installed for a little over a week and have seriously pinched my skin twice on it . what happens is when you unlatch it you first have to slide the gate in then swing it out . there are metal brackets that hold the two halves of the gate together and in which the horizontal wooden bars slide along to extend and contract look at the photo you ll see what i mean . the sliding movement is quite stiff and hard to do . i m sure with use it will loosen or perhaps i can put some wax on there . but when you re opening the gate in a rush as i did today when we were hit with a sudden downpour and i needed to run upstairs to shut the windows i put too much muscle into getting the darn thing to slide and the outside of my hand got pinched beneath the metal bracket . the first time i did this last week my older son woke up yelling for me and i wanted to get upstairs quickly before he woke the baby . my hand got pinched under that metal part and i thought to myself that i need to be more careful . but busy parents like us don t have the time to stop and think about being careful when opening a gate . when we ve got screaming kids and rain coming through the windows the last thing we should have to worry about is hurting ourselves on a safety gate ! ! i dont mean to beat a dead horse but seriously that s not good . the pinch i got today was major painful i ve got a blood blister that s almost half an inch long !
works great but is on the small side as in not a large diameter gauge would be easier to read if it was bigger .i have several of these in both small and large sizes . the large sizes are strongly recommended . in fact get at least two one to put water and fish and the other to store the net and other tools dry .the smaller size is barely big enough for any average net so it s difficult to handle the fish . however this large container is perfect for just about any net and also can hang on tanks of all sizes from gallon to gallon tank rims .the only drawback is that the plastic turns from clear when new to frosted scratched looking plastic in a hurry . not a problem normally but a problem for people trying to take pictures or look closely at the specimen for details .regardless this is an essential item to anyone with fish or small pets .strongly recommended .a good treat bag for the price . the draw string comes in very handy and it s made of good material . definitely get the larger size i got the cup size but it s hard to cram . cups of treats in there . also i have average size woman hands and it s hard to reach in to the bottom . it might be too small for someone with large hands .
as a foot rest this is probably as close as it comes to ideal . it s heavy with rubber foot pads so it doesn t slide when you put weight on it . it s sturdy steel with a rough sandpaper like texture to prevent your feet from slipping . and it s adjustable via the screws and wingnuts underneath .the foot rest has essentially different degrees of freedom . first the foot platform sits is connected to the mount platform via bolt in the middle of either side . so it pivots to create a flat platform a wedge shape . the mount platform is connected via thumb screws and wingnuts on either side . the screws sit in a specially formed channel in order to more easily lock the configuration you desire . it s hard to explain without a picture but this is where you further adjust the angle you want .having thumbscrews and wingnuts is convenient . it means you don t have to pull out the tools when adjusting the foot rest . but moving the foot rest around via the channels in the mount platform is not entirely easy but i don t see it being something you need to do quite often anyway .the price of the foot rest is a little high in my opinion . you could probably build something like this for a lot cheaper if you had the necessary tools and skill . most people don t so they ll pay a premium for a quality product like this .i find this product particularly useful because not only is it comfortable but my office is in my basement which has a tile floor that gets quite cold in the winter . this foot rest allows me to keep my feet off the tile so they stay comfortable .this is not the same gage of steel used in the s but i guess it doesn t take a brut to pull out staples . i do like the feel and the textured top and bottom as it allows for extra traction .a document holder that s this wide wider than a keyboard but not so wide i can slide mine under it when not in use might be expect to hold say a dictionary or a heavy cookbook . i wouldn t trust this one with a paperback . the vise grips on either leg do not hold the stand firmly no matter how much i tighten them . and the legs wobble . adjusting the position is difficult and not in synch with both sides . the stretchy band stretches too much to hold some types of books pages flat . all in all the design is just crappy .it looks nice and the individual pieces are solidly crafted . the heavy wobbly legs have so far failed to snap the plastic rails off the sides as physics might predict . there are apparently mounts for this that you can buy separately that screw into a surface . this might alleviate the wobble factor although i hope those mounts use grips that actually keep the plastic from sliding down .bottom line a quick search on amazon reveals a number of other document holders . unless you like frustration this is probably not the one you want .
the springs are a god send and do a great job of closing the screen door behind you . they were easy to install and will buy them in the future with our next trailer .picked these up for the solar panels i installed in my trailer and truck . they are nice quality and will work just fine .after years of being an idiot and trying to gently use my fingers to prevent my door from scraping on the wall of my car port i bought this . works exactly like it should . . . by being a barrier between my door and the wall . the thickness is perfect . it could stand to be a little longer for my inaccurate parking jobs . . . but very good nonetheless . even has two holes cut out so you can drill the sucker into a wall if need be .note the vinyl tape that it says is frequently purchased with this product will not work on a textured stucco wall .
first let me say that i was told i was purchasing an oz container of nutrafin betta bowl conditioner . when my box arrived i had this product in the box in stead . not sure what happened in the mix up but i ended up holding on to this product . this review is neutral and does not reflect the fact that the mix up happened .considering the volume of the container i got for the price this is more than a good deal for a chlorine treatment . i usually use api stress coat which according to both bottles should offer the same features . i gave this one a try one week during my regular water changes and my fish seemed to behave normally . nothing wrong with it . the item came as it is packaged in stores with no signs of defects . it is a water dechlorinator for aquariums . that s what the bottle says and that s what it does . no complaints .i have one big problem with all of tetra s products and that is that these bottles are not sealed at the top . it s a goopy liquid i m supposed to pour into my aquarium . i am not qualified to determine whether what s in the bottle is what the bottle says it has in it . when i get api products they come with a seal on top . this one there s no telling if what i m buying is what s in the bottle . since this is an online order there s less risk but i completely avoid tetra products in stores because they re open containers . do i know whether the employees thought mixing them around would be funny ? or if someone opened one up and got something in the bottle ? no ! if it s not something i d be comfortable with for human use i would never use such a product on my pets . sounds crazy but you just never know . fish can be delicate and costly . one wrong move like that and you could ruin a tank .i use this for a bath for new additions to the tank . they get a five minute bath then acclimate . the bottle i received a bottle well packed and sealed with tape . i received it quickly as well . the bottle was fresh and with a long expiration date . it came in the new packaging . a few drops in the bag and bye bye nasty . great for highlighting ick on a fish that it is hard to see .this product is absolutely fantastic i use it at home and at the pet shop where i work . it s safe for just about anything but do not purchase this product from amazon . this is the one and only time i ve ever had a problem with anything i ordered from amazon . twice i ordered it from them and between the two orders i barely got one full bottle . the lids were not screwed on properly and the liquid leaked out both time badly enough the second time that the bottle itself was in a bag inside the box and then the box was in a bag due to leakage . i love stress coat for my fish definitely but i ll go ahead and pay the few extra dollars at pet stores to make sure i get a full bottle .
my daugher was tiny at birth . .but now she is two months and her feet are starting to hang over the edge even with her pushed all the way up . daddy is so she is probably tall for her age beware if you have tall genes . . .this bed will not be useful for long with the non removable foot pad at the bottom .this a nicely molded piece of plastic simple no sharp edges . just the right size . our son started sitting on it for pracice at mo . his feet can be on the ground and hye likes to sit on it . the pail comes out easily to dump and the bottom has rubber so it doesn t slip on the floor . shield is also high enough for potty .this was a total piece of garbage . several things are wrong . . it doesnt fit every changing table . when i attach it to mine it tilts downward and is not level at all . you need to have a bottom slat or base to support it under the top slat it will go onto . . the side compartments keep falling off because they dont attach they just fit over the edges . . the biggest complaint is that the wipe tray does not fit every wipe box or wipe warmer and we have the same brand name wipe warmer that made this product . . consider that you will be taking away inches of walk space around your changing table after you put this hunk of plastic onto it .if you have your changing table in a small area or corner of a room this makes a difference .what a cheaply made piece of plastic .pass this up and buy a wall shelf to go over the changing table instead .
i truly believe this is the best diaper pail on the market . . . it s simple to use can take any garbage bag and does a fantastic job of containing odors . but my complaint is why couldn t they make it bigger ?i ve heard it s the biggest one you can buy but i find it frustrating that my regular kitchen sized garbage bags are only full when the diaper champ requires us to remove the bag . it s wasteful ! i know the simple solution is to buy smaller bags but i feel the product should accomodate the most common household garbage bag the tall kitchen bags and do it efficiently . the whole point of getting the diaper champ was so that we wouldn t have to buy separate bags for it ! diaper champ works well for me . it holds lots of diapers and i do not have to spend money on refill bags . i use tall kitchen trash bags . i am starting to notice an oder escape from the diaper pail but it s nothing that i cannot handle . i just use that as a sign to empty it spray with lysol and replace the bag .this is a must have product for all new moms ! ! ! ! the one thing that sets this product apart from the diaper genie is that this product can use regular garbage bags . . .any garbage bags will fit . the diaper genie needs it s own refill bags in order to work and that s just more money that you don t have to spend . . .this is easy to work and easy to dispose of the dirty diapers . . . .fantastic !
this scratch remover seems to be more of a polish and lube that will remove the surface scratches for the paint . it does not appear to have any grinding type ingredients in the paste .it will have little of no impact on deep scratches or deep nicks in the paint . it is easy to out on and remove and will a decent job for those light scratches . it did not remove any discoloring on my paint such as a stain left by a bird dropping . it ddi make the blemish lighter though .the chair rolls easily and is well constructed . the pad is thick enough to make sitting on it comfortable . i use the chair often while waxing or detailing the sides of a vehicle which is hard on my back and knees without the chair .doesn t add too much of a shine on the surfaces you apply it on its just right and leaves a clean streak free finish . i use this on the non leather surfaces in my car and on the black trim on the outside of my car
this pedal is exactly what i have been looking for since three years ago when i started performing . the distortion on this is deep has long sustain and has a nice tone to it that the classic boss ds pedal does not have . it s perfect for a great sound from heavy rhythm guitar chugging to fat bruising solos .i love this pedal and have been using constantly ever since i got it .however word of fair warning the pedal itself uses a v power charge rather than the typical guitar f x pedal v barrel jack . look at the power supply of a boss pedal to see what i am talking about . this proco rat pedal does not use that . if you buy this pedal you will have to do one of four things buy the power supply made specifically for this pedal . consistently use and replace batteries . find a converter from barrel jack to . mm jack . be an electrical engineer and rewire it yourself .other than the above excellent pedal !nice reverb pedal got rid of my boss reverb . the tc pedals are all that is on byboard except my wah and a phase if they made these pedals i d probablybe all tc electronics ! what else can i say ! ! ! !the bad monkey overdrive pedal does not produce crazy train metal distortion . it isn t made to and thus if you buy it for that sound you re off target . if that s the sound you want i recommend digitech tl hardwire metal distortion extreme performance pedal . what the bad monkey produces is delicious bluesy overdrive at a highly competitive price it currently sells for . here at amazon . unlike so many overdrive distortion pedals the bad monkey has independent and sensitive dials for treble high and bass low and using them can greatly affect the resulting sound they are by no means token dials . in particular the bass dial can be used to increase bass to an amazing degree especially when using double coil pickups it s easy to achieve a fat sound with this pedal . the pedal does not come with but does accept an external power supply i .e . an adapter . it can also be powered with a v battery which is installed under what s literally the pedal portion just as in boss pedals . the bad monkey is made of metal and can be used as a weapon if so needed . it seems extremely rugged again like boss pedals . i have several overdrive distortion pedals but i find myself turning to this one again and again . my impression of the bad monkey is based on using it with i an ibanez guitar with good double coil pickups ii an ibanez guitar with good single coil pickups similar to soapbar style or p pickups and iii a fender mustang ii amp . it works well with both single and double coil pickups . if i lost my pedal i would order another right away . i ve been playing for over years and can say with confidence that this is a great pedal .
my local fish stores swears by this i don t have a reef tank but a freshwater tank . fits in my eheim canister filter i have the small pro alongside the biomedia . i run a pretty intense tank with lots of fertilization high light co lots of food many plecos and a fair amount of mulm and organic debris from the large number of live plants . this helps keep my water clear and in balance . i can t say exactly how much this contributes to the health of my tank but i will continue to use it as a safety net . i also ran purigen for a while but it was getting expensive given the size of my tank so i m saving the purigen for my smaller tanks that also have a discoloration issue from the driftwood and instead use chemi pure in my larger display tank .i purchased the ac for my gallon tank . i really love it . it has an adjustable flow rate which is a really important feature to me . instead of using overpriced filterpads it has a large media basket so you can put whatever filter medium you want in this filter which is also really special to me because i m kinda on a low budget price for filter pads really adds up and i don t use carbon in my tanks pretty much all premade cartridges use carbon . as described this filter comes with activated carbon which i put off to the side as i said earlier i don t use carbon in my tanks biomax and a sponge .it also comes with a really nifty device for leveling the filter on the back of the tank . since it is clear you can see when the mechanical filtration media is starting to get clogged up . the only two things i have agiasnt this filter is that its made with fairly flimsy plastic and the gph ratings are way too low for the tank size they re intended for . i got the for my knowing that almost all filters were too small for the tank size they were intended for but i didn t oversize enough because the is still too small for my gallon at only gph let alone the gallon it s intended for a filter of this type should have a gph at least times the size of the tank it is intended for . now lets do the math . times the tank size it is intended for is so this filter is off by gph for its intended tank size and time is so it is off by gph for my tank . that means an aqeon is more suited for my tank then the ac . i am now getting the ac which is gph . in conclusion it is a very good filter just make sure you don t get fooled by the up to your tank size here gallon tanks rating and get one that is to times more gph then your tank for example you would need the ac gph for a gallon tank . if you are looking for a filter for a new tank i would highly recommend this filter and remember to cycle your tank good luck !perfect for my and gallon tanks . had a larger version for a gal tank like another reviewer and i don t know what took me so long to buy the inch size . love it !
i have used this on tile metal glass and interior walls and all surfaces are compatible with this mounting tape in my experience . i did notice that if the surface is ice cold make sure you warm the area up with a hairdryer if possible for a better stick . to remove i slid a razor through the foam core and used goo gone to remove the rest of the square worked great ! i was able to hang a wipe board near my front door than i had been meaning to mount for months this stuff gets the job done !great little stand . i use for my external hard drives to allow heat to dissipate . i also used for my ps to avoid overheating .we homeschool and use pretty much any available surface to write on during lessons white boards sliding glass doors windows the glass on the table tile and oilcloth . if it is handy non porus and previously tried then we will use it . the one major draw back with these markers is that they leave a residue which means i have to break out the glass cleaner that much faster . making me work harder gives it a lower rating . i do like the clear barrels and the chisel tip has held up rather nicely though .
these stickers work great cover labels well and work great with my usps priority boxes i use for shipping . however i do prefer the model that has one shipping label and one receipt per page instead of two shipping labels . the thin paper receipt is easier to deal with than a second sticker with the receipt printed on it . if your shipping service lets you print the shipping label without a receipt so you could use both labels for shipping than this one would be ideal .update after learning how to disable printing receipts from paypal read the other reviews i will now use these labels instead of .the avery white x inch ink jet printer labels work just as expected . they adhere well and are easy to print . most label printing programs should be able to handle this standard size and templates exist for programs such as word if needed . a solid choice for half sheet labels .the avery internet shipping labels make it easy to recycle those boxes and padded envelopes that you ve received . this saves money and is a green practice . this package contains sheets . x and each sheet has labels . x . .important the avery labels are for ink jet printers only . i called avery to ask if these labels could also be used in a laser printer . i was told that they should not be used in a laser printer because the heat might melt the adhesive material and it could damage the printer . for laser printers useavery white shipping labels for laser printers with trueblock tm technology inches x inches box of .these labels are designed to work with the us postal service s click n ship stamps dot com and ebay and paypal s online postage . or you can use avery s templates . one of the great things about the avery labels is how easy they make it to fill out the label information . the avery website has more than templates to choose from . you can choose from avery design print online avery designpro for windows and macs download templates for microsoft word or download the avery wizard for microsoft word . you can even do a mail merge for printing multiple labels .
this works great . it s sturdy and fit s nice and snug in a standard gallon bucket . i will be ordering more of these in the future .i use these to cover my original honda floor mats . i had to trim an area in the left upper corner so it would fit but after doing that it does the trick . granted these are not top quality but i only wanted something to protect my good carpet floormats . for . you can t beat it . i would highly recommend .works great . fairly easy swap . just be aware the front window regulators are the same on whether you have a suburban or tahoe or one of their gm family members . not so for the rear regulators . the full size suvs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones . the vehicle input feature amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference . the pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at but the vehicle id feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit . beware ! ! ! ! just so you know the dorman and fit the full size and the and fit the tahoe size vehicles .

these work extremely well have one on each end front and back of wheels took of the movement out of trailer .the feet on this bar slides off the truck bed sides and makes it worthless .when the ratchet is extended the mechanism for that ends up out of arms reach when standing outside the truck .allows me to keep my charger in the garage and my lower in the back of my house . is just the right lenght and the end has a cover so i can hang the cood out side and not worry about rain .
im starting a podcast . i blindly lept to buy the blue yeti . i can understand why one person with a youtube channel would love this . great for voice overs . in sound proof studios . the sound quality was good but it picked up way to much room noise . the ability to select the recording modes is great . if youll use it . i would not reccomend recording people at once on this . however recording a choir or something would work . but i will never do that and neither will you . this microphone only has a usb port . not xlr . so no hope of expanding . if you ever want to host a podcast with people you need to throw this away and get a mixer and new microphones .or you can do what i did and get audio technica atr s behringer xenyx dual mic input mixer shock mount broadcast boom combos and windscreens for the same price as a yeti raidus shock mount the pop pop filter and a generic mic stand .now i can replace my mixer and keep my mics or replace the mics then the mixer and do all sorts of expansions and add ons as well as get quality audio for hosts on my podcast .do not get this yeti unless your doing youtube voiceovers by yourself forever this review is legit i bought this mixer back in august or september cant really remember but i had a horrible experience with this unit but that s my fault i bought this mixer without looking at reviews or anything so i didnt know how to use it .i hooked this up to my desktop through the pink microphone input and got a horrible terrible mix the hiss from the fan ruined it i nearly had a panic attack so i took like months to do research and found out that behringer made the uca uca for this unit and the mixer to remove the hiss and unwanted noise .so buy this with the uca uca to clear up your recordings do not buy a rca to . mm cable if your using this for a studio setting like me and if your beginning like me do not let these wealthy people fool you you dont need thousand dollar equiptment the podcaststudio usb from behringer would be fine .so all in all with my cheap microphone from radio shack and this mixer the quality was good but the hiss ruined it ! ! ! ! ! use a usb audio interface with this from behringer do it if you want star audio quality ! their website has asio drivers to assist you ohhh and go on youtube and search up uca studio you ll get videos to help .please please please please do research before you buy anything ! good day everyone ! di use this adapter on the interface mix board end of channel of my xlr cable snake to change channel into my monitor return . i plug an xlr to female stereo adapter to the other end to create a headphone jack at the musician end of my setup . now i can record with channels and monitor with . it s an channel xlr snake . why do i go through all that you ask ? because i have an channel xlr snake and instead of buying another snake why not adapt the snake i have ? hence the word adapter . . . p i love it . it s a great tool to add versatility to your setup no matter what you re doing . definately recommend this product to anyone that would happen to need to change an xlr to balanced stereo . . . it s high quality and very solid i definately expect this to last me a long time .
it is hard to find a printer that lists windows server as a compatible operating system . i tried some other brand printers and the drivers would refuse to install . even though canon support told me that this printer is not officially supported for server i installed the drivers anyway and it works perfect !i have an old canon i which uses the bci e ink cartridges . fyi should canon discontinue this color e series i found bci cartridges bci c m y fits and works great without any problem . thank you amazon for providing the inkjet replacement information check list .this is a great product for my canon laser copier printer fax .
i use this often to record my band s gigs . now if they would make one that will hold a par can so i can turn my extra mic stands into single can lighting racks !this is a must have for musicians or even speech givers that may want to use a table for their music speeches . it is easily mounted on the mic stand and can be adjusted to your needs . i would not do without it now as it easily replaced my cumbersome music sheet stand . i am using it with my samsung tablet and can also be used with my wife s toshiba tablet . highly recommended .i needed a new stand for my home studio so i thought i was cutting corners when i purchased this one . as it turns out this stand is practically indistinguishable from mybelmonte orchestra stand deluxein construction and material quality . that stand sells for twice the price of this one at the time of this review .the stand is adjustable enough for sitting or standing musicians and is stable enough to use outside . the rest tray mechanism holds a lot of weight without losing any adjustments . in fact i have attached analeratec universal tablet mountto hold an ipad with sufficient room left over for a page copy of thethe new real book volume and it holds those rock steady .another feature that i like is the legs can be configured like a tripod with varying angles which is useful for outdoors with light breezes that would knock over lighter stands . or you can set the legs flush for maximum stability if space and the stand s footprint are not problems .bottom line this is a professional grade stand at a student stand price . i am thoroughly pleased with it and if ever i need another stand this is the model i will purchase .
the flooded battery for my riding mower wouldn t hold a charge for more than day regardless of whether it was trickle charged with a battery tender or charged in recovery mode with my diehard platinum charger . skeptical i ordered this after reading that it was both reliable and had the potential to revive an otherwise useless battery . hours of charging later . . . and my riding mower battery now holds a charge . i also put a ring terminal comfort indicator onto the mower battery and deliberately let the mower sit . . . and the battery moved from green to yellow fully charged to less than charged across a week . . . instead of full discharge in a single day .i probably need a new battery for the riding mower but this charger bought me time and proved its worth doing what my diehard platinum charger could not .i see a lot of negative reviews for this charger that i think are partially due to amazon s incorrect description and the fact that most people don t know what size or type of charger they need . including myself i am a practicing electronic engineer with more than yrs experience . i did not know much about battery chargers until recently researching what a good battery charger should do . this charger only delivers a max of . a . this means if you try to charge a discharged auto battery ah it will take a long long time . this charger does work great for topping off a car battery at . v . the instructions included clearly state the charger will automatically shut off after hours of charging . the charger will restart and continue charging if you unplug and then plug the charger in again . best to get a higher capacity charger . this charger does have a float mode sort of . actually it shuts off the charging current and monitors battery voltage . when the battery voltage drops low enough the charger cycles on to top it off and then shuts off again .my summary st i like this charger and think it does a good job for the price . gold box special was . tax . i would definitely buy it at the regular price for it s basically automatic . don t have to set the voltage and it won t damage anything if you reverse the clips accidently . compact size and reasonable quality clamps .this charger does what it is designed for . that is charge small batteries and top off larger automotive batteries . this is an excellent maintenance charger for all batteries to keep them fully charged when not in use . my opinion personally i would not leave any charger connected to my battery for more than hours . now i use a cheap mechanical timer that is set to turn on for hour every hours . i would prefer a timer that i can set to turn on twice a week for a few hours .the charger is small feels solidly built with heavy plastic . it gets very warm aftercharging at . a but not warm enough to be concerned . no cooling fan i gave this charger stars because price and performance is very good . build quality is good as well .amazon description poor is incorrect in that this charger is not intended to be used to charge a low discharged car battery . the chart in the description that shows the charging times is different than the manual . . the included manual has a chart that states this charger should only be used as a top off or maintenance charger for auto batteries . in addition the charger in charging mode automatically shuts off after hours of charging . a good safety feature in my opinion . charging details i discharged a car truck jump start battery pack to . v or approx charge . typical full charge is . v to . v . to discharge the battery i used a battery alternator tester . i have a voltmeter attached to charger and a current meter in series with battery and battery charger negative terminal . at the start of the charge

after hours the charge current is . a . charge voltage is . v . after hours the charge current is . a . charge voltage is . v .note that the charge current is decreasing as the battery is approaching

declining . charger is in the monitor mode . in monitor mode the charger ac power is w measured with a belkin watt meter .almost hours seems like a long time to charge a battery and this isn t even a full capacity car battery . but it did a good job of gently charging the battery especially when it was near full charge . the important thing to me is the charging current declined as the battery neared full charge . this prevents overcharging and truly tops off the battery to maximum capacity .i tested the battery the next day with a battery tester and it passed well within the good battery full charge limits . the results were much better than the charger that came with the battery pack where it tested near weak .very happy with the purchase . i would buy this exact model again . should there be any problem s in the future i will update this review .ships from and sold by amazon .using this to reach a motorcycle far away from the outlet while . charges just the same and the battery tender still indicates when the battery is charged properly
i ordered tm bk unit but after a couple of delays with my local delivery agent decided to buy a unit locally which turned out to be the korg beat boy .the beat boy is everything that this unit is and then some . in addition to the metronome and tuner it has a record function and drum tracks in all different patterns . the units have an almost identical front panel with the metronome patterns in with the drum options the extra buttons for the record and an external mic for acoustic instruments .had i seen the beat boy first i would have ordered it instead as i was looking for a drum machine anyway . the functions which are shared between the units work really well the tuner is accurate and fast and can t fault the metronome .i will probably keep the tm bk as a spare but i m also glad my local shippers have prolonged the wait . if you just want a metronome and tuner this is a fine unit but if you re considering a drum machine too look at the beat boy before making any decisions .i buy and sell electric guitars and often i meet with someone at a half way point where access to electricity is unavailable . i was surprised at the volume and tone that came out of a unit so small . there is even and overdrive which makes this totally cool as some of my customers want to schredd a little . this is battery operated but can be plugged in using an adapter . i bought a planet waves v power adapter to go with the honey tone . it might work in a busker situation .i like this power supply but i wish that the led s only turned on for the channels that you have a cable plugged in to so for that reason i ll give it stars as opposed to . the quantity of power outlets and the amperage s that it provides are best in class .
look it is a mouse pad . it really doesn t even work it just is except when it comes apart . two days that s all i got . bad dog .with a product like this it either works or doesn t work . this works ! don t hesitate to buy . great for filing .the old clich eacute you get what you pay for is true in this case . i ordered one didn t work laser pointer returned to amazon got another one and it wouldn t work either advance nor backup the slides . returned it and ordered the logitech presenter .
this product works as advertised but you should beware . these are right angled and they will not fit in a lot of pedals including the crybaby wah .you have been warned ! ! !if you own an american strat or tele this is a must have for the neck of your prize . i love this . it proudly states the guitar s origin of corona . california with the classic fender name scribed . wonderful . i have these on all three of my fenders . again these should really come standard on all american strats .i am upgrading my chinese fender strat with american hardware . i own an american strat too and plan on making the best of the chinese one . going to upgrade electronics and everything else too .these are exactly what s on my american strat stars
the width is nice wide enough to distribute the weight but not too wide . attaching it is a snap . the suede gives it a nice grip to your shoulder so the guitar doesn t slide around .this is such a nice bag for the price . nicely padded with an ample zip compartment that can hold your snark capo or whatever . there is a handle and a shoulder strap . plus it is reallly a nice looking bag black with a little white trim in front .a little large and not really light but folds down and the tray folds in a clever way . fits into the supplied bag with shoulder strap . very well made although the bag is a little lower quality . sturdy enough to hold a big binder page spiral bound book and not feel at all unstable . goes up and down and tilts back . no slippage .
i bought this set for my cat . this is a great set at an even better price . i love the dual bowls so i can put food in water or treats in the other . bowls are removable to add food and cleanup easily . if you are looking for a good product at a low price this is it . i highly recommend it !i have black angelfish and they fight each other over them ! they are nicely packed in the container and not smashed . would definitely buy them again for the price .this is a darn good piece of aquarium filer . the price for it on amazon just cant be beat but its worth every penny no matter where you buy it . i love the fact that i dont have to purchase any of there media and you can set it up with as much bio rings or sponge as you want . i bought a second one for my larger tank and put the two bio rings they came with into one and filled the other with some small pieces of lava rock to save money . they run really quiet and seem to be powerful
very good strap but the pick pocket does not hold the picks securely . especially when you take off the guitar for a break . either a pocket closure or a spring loaded clip is neededthis clip does the same thing that the hercules guitar stands do lock your guitar in place so you don t have to worry about it dropping or falling off the hanger . the auto close function on the hanger is the best part of this hanger . simply lift your guitar and it lets go everytime .this thing is tiny and does not have the breakable swivel head of the original snark . this is the only tuner you need !
consistently measures the temp in my tank at degrees . nice size . great quality for the price . highly recommended for your tank .this is a stylish well made container for a betta fish .pluses high quality finish no rough or unfinished edges . the included vinyl background is double sided and appears to be waterproof or at least water resistant available in several colors to suit your tastes . kit arrives with water conditioner and flake food for the novice betta keeper . even includes small diameter gravel which is preferred for beneficial bacteria and the like .minuses water temperatures are subject to ambient temp of the room . bettas are tropical fish so unless your room is heated at degrees the water in this tank will likely fall below that range which will stress the betta . no light included . at nearly it would have been nice to include a halogen bulb light . the marine led light accessory sold separately costs more than the tank itself and does not include an on off switch . gravel displacement it would be neat if the gravel stayed neatly packed in the rectangular basket on the tank bottom . however it is far to easy for the stones to fall out of the perimeter and nearly impossible to fetch any of the gravel once displaced due to the size of the tank and gravel itself which inherently defeats the clean zen look . great concept but hard to implement .seems like people are confusing ethics and lack of fish keeping experience with this product . i have kept bettas in my office with daily bi weekly water changes depending on the container size for years . the main problem with this kit is the difficulty in maintaining a temperature within range that is comfortable for a betta fish . there are . watt heaters available that lack an adjustable thermostat that recommends that the temperatures be monitored . so if this is marketed as a betta kit it just falls short as a heater is needed . if this was sold strictly as a stylish container then i would give it stars .just for reference i originally purchased two of these as gifts for the kids and days later ordered two aqueon evolve gallon tanks to replace them . if one chooses to be a fish keeper do it the right way or skip the hobby all together . . .this inch airstone is perfect for my gallon aquarium !
the listing for this item can be confusing if you are not sure what stereo xlr is . stereo xlr is meant to be similar to your stereo headphones where left and right are separate unbalanced wires . this cable is configured to be a stereo unbalanced xlr to a stereo unbalanced trs cable . this item is not a mono balanced xlr to a stereo unbalanced mic cable .a little bit a soldering can fix this connector by moving the red wire from ping to pin with the white wire . pin then ties to pin with the ground wire .the planet waves instrument cables have a nice heft to them and click firmly into the amp instrument .i have had no problems with them at all .the attached elastic tie down that comes with these custom cables makes it easy to coil the cables for storage . stars .having feet of xlr xlr m f cables that can be used any way i want e .g . ea foot for stereo foot for mono or ea foot for multichannel work is very flexible .the packaging on these was also well done with a ziploc type bag and a velcro reusable wrap on each cord white to store them when not in use .as all of my sound equip is xlr or speakon connectors this worked great for a recent outdoor dj job . i ended up using all of the cords for mics and amplified speakers plus another of their foot cables for interconnect . you can never have enough xlr cables or adapters !
my baby likes the baby einstein play gym . like the other reviewers i have noticed that she loves the twinkling musical star at the top . when my daughter is in play mode she really gets into looking at all of the different pieces the rabbit picture the mirror the birds and she is just riveted by that star . honestly i don t think this gym is better than any of the others out on the market because we also have the fisher price barn yard play gym and she likes it just as well . i would say the advantage to this one is that it folds down to a more compact size and there are no bulky plastic stand pieces in the structure of it like there are in the fp barnyard toy .i purchased it at a local retailer when they had the price marked down i don t think i would have bought it otherwise . it is a little pricey for what it is and how long my daughter will actually be playing with it .if you don t already have a play gym i would recommend this one . you will get lots of fun mileage out of it i would just advise you to watch your local box store for it to go on sale instead of paying full price . also i notice the original list price on this site is twenty over what the local stores are asking as the regular price .when in the market for a baby gym this one will do the trick but i highly recommend the tiny love baby gym over this one . there are things about this one that stand out . as one person mentioned it does have a neat star that eats batteries also the little caterpillar that detaches is very cute .i do not like the way this baby gym handles when putting it up or setting it up .looking at baby toys is so overwhelming . this set has all you need of course you ll end up buying more toys but really this is all you need ! . the toys are high quality colorful and they encourage exploration in play . i highly recommend this set .
please note this review is for people who are buying this gate for your typical standard bedroom doorway which should measure about across .i have this gate purchased at local store and another gate i purchased from amazon . both are great gates and even though they are different brands they are nearly identical in parts mechanics etc .even without the optional mounting cups which can be screwed into the wall for extra security this gate is very sturdy and should be able to stand up to your typical year old i said typical i know there are exceptions ! ! . to open the gate you have to press the top button and lift up quite a bit i am not so sure a year old would be able to figure that out . the gate stands about tall so an average toddler would be able to touch the top of the gate with their hand .i like this gate but if you are only looking to gate off a bedroom doorway there is a cheaper better alternative the other gate i own dreambaby extra tall swing closed safety gate whitethis gate is normally around cheaper than the summer infant gate and is about taller ! but the dreambaby gate can only extend from so is only good for a bedroom doorway or narrow hallway . the summer infant gate comes with two extension pieces .both gates are good i would be happy with either !this gate is really a great product . i love the fact that you don t have to hardware mount the gate no drilling into the doorways required and it s still very sturdy . it was incredibly easy to install and is very safe and secure . my month son knows how the gate opens but cannot open it because of the weight required to push down on the lever . the only negatives i encountered were the first hands free gate i purchased was not painted properly so i had to return it for another one . i had to buy the quot gate extension for the gate to fit in the doorway . so in the end there are additional costs if the opening you intend to use the gate for is not that narrow . but all in all it s totally worth it .this gate works great ! we plan on buying another ! although it is pricy compared to those others out there you get what you pay for a grand gate that is true to it s name very tall and very secure ! i love it . it was easy to install and i love that you can use it either as a pressurized gate or install it as a permanent gate . we have it installed permanently to our nursery s doorway and plan on getting another to use as a pressurized gate to move it to other areas as needed in elsewhere in our house . it also comes with the extension parts if you have large doorway others i learned you had to purchase separately ! .we also have large dog lb lab . our other pressurized gate was shorter and did little to hold her weight when she would stand on it with her front legs . i can t remember the brand but it was about . with a plastic grill and center arm that extended . the sure secure gate holds the weight of our dog and is too tall for her jump over .
i am using these products as a work to create a recipe book . i love the fact that the tabs are big and easy to write on with my sharpie . once set they don t smear or smudge . however i can clean them off to make changes fix errors . i also like that i can write on the divider itself in the same way . i have been adding an index on the actual divider in some cases . these work great and the fact that you get sets means you can tackle bigger projects without running out ! i have used sets in my recipe books so far !what can i say ? avery makes great labels . these are my favorite size and i love that they block out what s underneath so i can reuse shipping envelopes .i use this for everything . i use it to print notecards . i use it to make greeting cards . i use to print door hangers avery charges for door hangers with a little effort you can make from a box of this . i keep coming back i ve gone through four of these .
works wellworks as well as expected the number and variety of pieces comes in quite handy for small delicate work .this is what is needed to get the job done .works great on my wrangler sport . heavy duty rubber that fits well in my hitch receiver and looks like it will last awhile .
wonderfull gate ! it swings in both directions . it is extra tall . you dont have to mount it on to your walls . it comes with two extensions and i have used it with both extensions on it and it dosent give at all . our house has odd openings and i can fit this anywhere . i still have a plastic gate in my kitchen and just came online to order a second one of these to replace that .good news for parents of curious toddlers . the way to open it is a button on the top of the gate since this is an extra tall gate you d have to be the parent of a future nba player to get to it . even if you have a super tall todler you have to push the button over and lift the swing gate to open it . . . it is very easy for most adults however visitors will have problems with it ! ! !also if you need extensions for a gate you need to check the price of extensions . . . i needed both extensions and by the time i added them onto other gates i would have paid . or more . that is the reason i chose this one .this gate is grate especially if you have pets and stairs . the only thing i didn t like about the gate is how hard it is to bend configure each panel of the gate .this is the second kidco product i have purchased . let me start by saying that their products are some of the safest out there and i have every confidence in the security of the gates i have installed . but the first gate i purchased was the standard gateway that uses hardware to install . you can see my review there but the thing that is pertinent here is that they only included limited hardware in the box which would not work safely if installing the gate into dry wall even when there is a stud . so instead of including another set of screws that would ve cost them about . kidco likes to make busy parents go buy that stuff themselves .well this gate has its own torturous surprise for busy parents who are trying to multitask every hour of the day . kidco kindly includes two extensions making this gate much more versitile than most on the market . the thing they don t tell you is that these extensions are held in by the same tension that holds the gate into the wall . each of these tension screws are completely separate from one another which is good design because it allows installation over uneaven surfaces . however because there is no mechanism holding these extensions into place this means that the parent installing the gate must use two hands to hold up the gate make sure each of the separate extension brackets and two separate support bars and the metal extension bars which the brackets slide over none of which lockinto place in anyway don t fall off all the while trying to tighten one tension screw at a time . . . i cannot even explain to you how two limbs are not enough to get the job done and still remain sane by the end of the process .throw me a bone kidco ! how about the brackets clip or screw that holds the brackets into place so they don t slide off while i m trying to mount the gate ? something ! ? !unfortunately you will find that kidco often makes the best products for this kind of thing but they sure do cut corners on the little stuff that would make a parent s life a lot easier .
not much to say here dielectric grease . works as advertised large enough tube that should last quite a while . thanks !not much to say here except it is a plastic funnel about inches in diameter with a long and flexible see through plastic hose . in my opinion this is a must have item for the vehicle trunk or truck tool box and this is one of acceptable quality and function .the handle could be a tad shorter and the weight could have been reduced a little . it feels rather heavy and unwieldy to use and it would have been better if the scraper were on the opposite side of the brush . the brush bristles are plentiful and stiff making short work of most types of snow .overall stars decent price although could be less expensive and lighter in weight . the scraper is sturdy so far and bristles work well in clearing snow . i wouldn t mind it if it were a few inches shorter .
fits all of my cords even my apple cords perfectly . works exactly as advertised .i bought this at babies r us . it did not fit my rail . it says it fits most standard rails but doesn t give any measurements . how are you supposed to know if it will fit unless you purchase it ? what a pain .this car seat base does not work with graco snugride seats . just make sure you order the correct one .
i purchased this plus the little dividers and store my earrings in it . it s just the perfect size . the way i buy jewelry i think i may need to buy another one soon !i don t have anything negative to say about this product or my buying experience . it came on time and was exactly what i was looking for . it works great and i am sure i will continue to purchase office supplies through amazon in the future .this was a great deal and i was pleased with the purchase . will order again when i run out of item .
very transparent with great sustain and a hint of dirty boost if you crank the knobs to max .built well sounds good and does what you d expect .i like how easy it can be attached to the soundhole or for that matter to the headstock where you may get less feedback than with the soundhole . it works well but produces a somewhat metallic sound not quite true to your guitar you will note this in particular with a classical guitar . this can be balanced to some degree with your amp s equalizer and or the treble and bass settings . however compared to the axl pickup which i bought for comparison the cherub is suboptimal when it comes to the sound it produces . it is not bad but it does not reach the quality of the axl . both are inexpensive enough that you may buy them together and see what you like best . the cherub may actually sound better with an acoustic metal sting guitar .this unit is well constructed .switches and knobs feel sturdy .the user guide is informative .it has a wide tone range . i usually play a hofner club bass and it sounds deep and clear .it is useful if you want to dial in a good sound and just leave it set . it doesn t have presets . you can loop an effects processor thru it .
these are airtight and roll easily even full of dog food . i have several of them in different sizes and the quality is great . it s quick and easy to open and close . i highly recommend them . they re far superior to most pet food storage containers .my dog loves these treats . they are handy for training but they are dry so water is needed . they are easy to pocket and the crumbs at the bottom make a nice treat over dog food .smells like mineral spirits . looks like a aerosal can but is actually a screw on top bottle . i pour about cup in dish and run the blades in the wash while turned on . keeps the blades sharp clean and lubed . overall good product .
i love this test kit . i have always had to take water to my area petsmart to have my water tested because i just cannot figure out those little cards that you dip in the water to read the levels . throw them all away and buy this kit . it s foolproof and so easy to use .the charts that you compare the water colors too are very clearly marked and you have no mistake in what you are reading . it tells you exactly how many drops to put in how much water and how long to let it set to read it . the bottles contain enough chemicals to do hundreds of tests . each bottle contains fl oz of test liquid and depending on the test you only use about drops per test . i especially like that all the test bottles and glass vials are in a nice compact case so i don t have all these bottles rattling around the drawer that i keep my aquarium stuff in . and when you do empty one the ones you buy in the store are the exact same size so they fit right into the kit for storage .the written instructions are very clear to understand for testing .this tetra aqua product is easy and effective for making tap water safe for aquarium fish . i like that the bottle has a squeeze top and a cap has a narrow profile and adds both slime coat additive and dechlorinator heavy metal neutralizer . the product also eliminates chloramines .since chlorine and chloramine are both broken down with one tool it s a superior product over the novaqua water conditioner but only if you have chloramines to deal with you need to check with your local water provider .with novaqua you have the benefit of a product that adds beneficial water electrolytes but nothing to cover chloramines unless you also purchase the sister product of amquel . remember you want to add as few additives to your aquarium as you can safely manage to decrease the overall ion load on your fishes gills .the narrow profile of the bottle means i can easily store the bottle among my fish stuff . it slides in really easily on my shelf of fish paraphenalia . it s a nice break from all those round bottles that leave a lot of space unused . it s also more ergonomic squeeze wise .with the squeeze top i can choose to add actual drops for small tanks or use the cap as a cup measure for larger tanks . this takes care of a problem many conditioners have that are either established for tiny tanks ie under five gallons . . .where you should only add a drop per gallon and for larger tanks where you need a teaspoon for every gallons . so this one product can service those one gallon betta tanks from the squeeze top and those gallon tanks from the cap . there are also equal measure marks on the side of the container for making up really big batches of dechlorinated water . each raised measure equals ml or gallons . anyway i like that this container makes my life easier .it would be an even better product if the inside of the cap was marked for each teaspoon amount one gallon amount . as it is i only needed to measure out a teaspoon the first time poured that into the cap and then marked that amount with a sharpie for future use .in summary if you have chloramines in your tap water this is the product to get for conditioning your aquarium water . if you do not have chloramines then i suggest the novaqua water conditioner to add electrolytes instead .each . oz bottle ml treats gallons . directions are drops per gallon or one capful ml for gallons . i prefer this product over another water conditioner because it gives directions to treat each gallon helpful for smaller betta tanks or partial water changes in other small tanks .
i use this paper to print out the original copies of my association newsletter . it makes very clear original prints which then are used to make color copies for our members . much better than printing on regular inkjet paper . also i use it for printing pictures taken in the classroom . the students can cut and mount their pictures when doing writing projects .i bought this primarily for the price ! it is a great buy for sheets of photo paper . i was hoping to print some large photos for framing and hanging on the wall and needed large photo paper . i like the . x since it is easy to work with and fits the printer perfectly it is hard to find a frame other than document frame for this paper but i found a nice document one at walmart that looks really nice most photo frames are x . i put these in the printer hp officejet and printed my photos from iphoto on my mac when i printed i selected hp photo paper for the paper type and hit print . it took the printer about minutes to print the entire page of full color borderless and for a test i ran my finger across the page nothing came off and the paper was dry when it came out of the printer and there was no smearing make sure you use proper settings or you might get smearing or wetness . the print looked amazing and after framing it and hanging it i am very happy ! every printer is different so be sure to make sure your printer supports photo paper and that you choose the right settings for photo paper when you print your document or image . i highly recommend this and you can not find a better buy for full size photo paper anywhere ! ! !i bought this photo paper to make personalized photo albums for family members and for my daughter s nursery school teachers . i am impressed with how easy this is to use and how nicely photos turn out when printed at home on a color ink printer . we have an hp scanner printer copier that we purchased several years ago and the quality of the photos we print at home using this paper is excellent . colors turn out darker and crisper than commercially developed photos . you need to let the photos rest for a few minutes before touching them or inserting them into a photo book or you may scratch the ink or have it stick to the plastic photo sheaths . however after about minutes you ll have commercial quality photos .if you want to print just a few individual photos to frame in your house or give as gifts this is a lot faster and easier than getting things developed professionally and the quality is great !
this is an excellent collar training system . . petsafe is a reliable company that takes pet care seriously . my dogs took to the collars so well they only need to wear them as a reminder a few hours a week . they actually go the hang of it after just one doorbell bark session and actually stayed away from the door the entire time they had the collars on . if the kids get the dogs going all i have to do is grab a collar and show them and they settle down immediately . there is an intimidation factor present and it works wonderfully . the nylon section is strong and durable and i have had nothing but good luck with the product . i would highly recommend it to anyone who cringes every time a visitor rings your doorbell or a squirrel passes by . it truly helps them keep control without you lifting a finger . excellent product !this product works great . just remember this collar takes special batteries that we can only find at our local pet store and are for two of them . otherwise the collar has worked great on our dog . i like that there are three different settings on the collar .i love this leash for my dog . my dog enjoys it as well because he can go more places . my dog is a small dog and i got a med . size leash for him because he can pull real well and he loves the extra long leash .
if your printer requires cartridges the twin pack is the pack to purchase hp tri color twin pack ink cartridge in retail packaging c fn . i always like to have a spare cartridge on hand not because they have little printing capacity but because i never like to be caught with my pants down and no ink to print .i ve had two hp printers over the past four years that both used this cartridge and have had no problems with printing using hp cartridges . this is the larger volume counterpart to the cartridge . paired with a extra volume black cartridge hp twin pack black inkjet print cartridge with vivera ink c fn i get a decent page count out of this printer .although not fabulous but acceptable for printing photographs the cartridge paired with this one does a reasonable job . is not easy to find in stores hp photo ink cartridge in retail packaging c wn .if i m not in a hurry and printing on inexpensive paper i usually ignore the flashing front panel low ink lights and wait until the one of the colors doesn t print anymore . that maximizes ink usage from these cartridges . if the printer stops printing because the lights are on solid or the software refuses to print simply remove both cartridges and replace them you ve now reset the ink level sensor .compared to lexmark hp ink is less expensive . i think hp and epson are pretty well matched on ink cost .despite being very happy with my hp officejet the ink has turned out to be a painful expense . in the past six months i have gone through three of these cartridges . i hate to single hp out but the entire inkjet industry is guilty of fighting price transparency with inexpensive printers and inflated ink . this is not to mention the constant changing of ink cartridges models . does hp really need different models of ink cartridges ? no . it would in fact be much cheaper to consolidate the cartridge offerings . however this would lead to excessive duplication and remanufacturing by third parties .what is particularly amusing and perhaps offensive to some is the enclosed recycling envelope that comes with new hp ink cartridges . this prepaid envelope with the empty cartridge goes back to hp so that it can demonstrate its environmental leadership . of course hp doesn t want the empty cartridges to go back into the hands of companies that refill and remanufacture them . although i haven t done the calculations i would assume the transportation and handling costs would actually do more harm than good to the environment . my suggestion is to fill the prepaid envelope with torn up remains of the consumer packaging that comes with the cartridges .this number tri color ink cartridge by hewlett packard is an essential for those of us who use the hp deskjet d printer or any other printer that accepts this cartridge .the three colors of yellow red and blue well maybe it s a bluish green can be combined by the printer to produce a wide array of other colors very effectively . the cartridge takes up little space if you care to stock up on them and it comes well packaged so that it won t break during shipment . moreover the installation and removal of the cartridge is very easy so when changing the ink cartridge you will rarely have any difficulty .if you care to save some money you can buy this ink cartridge in the same package as a black ink hp this would be even more cost efficient . the ink goes faster than you would think it would go !overall the quality of the ink is rather good despite my one complaint that the ink goes faster than i would like it to go . the cartridge provides you with the ability to print a multitude of colors on your paper and replacement is easy .
comfortable to use with the keyboard . it is ergonomically good to have one . supports your wrist .i always love the gel support pads for wrists so i was very content to find this mouse pad with built in gel support . my experience unfortunately was that the glue of the mouse pad kept weakening and now the gel pad is completely separate from the pad itself . as easy fix however just needs an extra trip to the local craft or hardware store for stronger glue . the tilt features are custom made . it included rubber foot pegs that you can put on the pad underneath to choose your angle . those have not fallen off in the six or so months that i have been using the mouse pad . overall i love it . it allows the wrist to get the support it needs and is makes a very comfortable computer session .the m tilt adjustable gel wrist mouse pad is a great idea if you re looking to improve your computer station either at home or at work . the mouse pad is tilt adjustable with a variety of settings . it is easy to assembly you simply stick on the height adjusters on the bottom of the mouse pad . this will hold it steady and also give the mouse a comfortable angle which is easy on your wrists . the platform also comes with a gel filled wrist pad and an antibacterial coating to keep germs away . it s a must have for anyone who is on the pc for extended periods of time . it also goes side by side with the m tilt adjustable gel wrist rest platform keyboard platform .
well made works like a charm and felt like it was made with quality material and not made of cheap parts and plastic .these a cheaply made with corrugated plastic however they are surprisingly durable . these are not . x paper size . they are about half sheet size .i bought these to replace the plastic bridge pins that came on my fender acoustic . these are easy to install using the instructions or without . these are also sturdy and look very good .
economical and works like it should . always stick with brand inks with your printer . these don t smudge and won t destroy your printer . i recommend canon brand inks .i use this in a black and white laser fax machine and a new hewlett packard color laser printer . i don t think it has ever jammed in either one . it used to jam in my old tecktronics phaser but that was due to the design of the printer .hint the type of critter on the package corresponds to the type of paper . and i imagine it probably doesn t work well on inkjet printers because it s . . .you guessed it . . .laser printer paper !i bought this printer in mid .i don t do tons of printing but enough that i know i wasted a lot of money printing documents with an inkjet printer for years before i bought this brother laser printer . the toner cartridges last and last . and if you don t do a lot of printing another plus is the ink don t dry up .woooo hooooo
i really like this cable ! maybe it s not top quality but it feels solid to me and works just fine . i keep it attached to my little practice amp and play a few feet away . it probably stretches feet if you really need it too . what i really like is that it s compact and i don t have cables laying all over the floor .overall it s a solid cable for practice . i ll buy more .don t know what the delay was but it took forever to get here . the picks look like they will work although they are a little hard to bend we will see if it s what i was looking for thanks !inexpensive and practical . you don t have to watch out too much when placing a guitar on this just about any angle will work . needs little space another plus .
this item is fantastic ! prints faxes and copies beautifully . i still can t believe how cheap it is . my only beef is that when printing photos colors it prints a lot redder and pinker than how you scanned it so you better learn to adjust it .this is an incredible scanner and seems built very very well . i know this will last for a long time just like all the epson equipment i ve had in the past .installation was a breeze no problems at all . just make sure to follow the instructions and install the software before connecting and powering on the scanner . i m running windows xp on a laptop with a dock and it took all of seconds for the scanner to be ready on my machine once i powered the scanner on . very fast and easy .the scanning software is very easy to use . you can scan using auto mode home mode or professional mode each mode giving you more options to choose in your scanning .i tried all three scanning modes and i got beautiful scans with the auto mode so i didn t fret about having to select a bunch of different options when scanning . but i also liked using the advanced modes and getting different looks to my scanned materials . there s a great preview button that lets you view the options selected so you can quickly change an option if you don t like it .the scanning plate for negatives is easy to use and the scans came out wonderful ! i love seeing my old pictures again ! and it s wonderful that i can save the ones i want and delete the scanned items i don t want . no more wasting time figuring out which negatives i should get made into photos . and no more wasting money going to the mall to get photos made out of my negatives !this could very well be my printer of choice for the next five years . i use it to do everything from faxing papers to work all the way to scanning copying and especially printing photos . i have to say that everything works great . a few features that i want to tell you about in particular are printing photos and using the adf automatic document feeder . the mp prints such great photos that my friends cant tell that they were printed . i was astounded by the exceptional quality and the speed that they print in about seconds for the first print and about for each one after that . the adf is really handy when you want to scan up to pages to copy or scan . the software is great because it compiles all the pages into one simple universal pdf file so you can do your business and send an email attachment all in one shot . i was concerned when people were talking about little things here and there that might be just a little bit off . i did not notice any of that happening . if i knew the quality of the printer before i got it i would be willing to spend more than i spent on it .
there good micsgreat microphone at a very good ricegood all around mike . if you are looking for a solid mike to start your studio i recommend this one . best used for guitar and mid range instrument recording but not bad on vocals . best mike for the price and purpose .
don t buy this rear wiper for a st generation xb it will not fit ! get oem or a wiper from elsewhere !probably a good filter but didn t fit the application . amazon made it right but be sure this fits your car before buying .fits my john deere lawn tractor which is model la and likely it fits all the l la and d series lower end john deere tractors . please post a comment if it does not and i ll update this reviewcurrently amazon says it does not fit my third generation miata nc but it doesthese filters come top in most online filter tests and i use them in almost all my cars
a good solid piece of equipment ! it sounds as good as it looks and it is absolutely beautiful ! the description listed slight wear marks on the back but i had to really look hard to find it one . it came as well packed as a brand new guitar and looks like one !works like the picture shows . hangers adjust to required width of head stock . wood finish is nice look on the wall .very nice guitar pics sound almost as nice as metal guitar pics very lovely size was as expected great sound
it s not necessarily easy to pick and choose basic school or office supplies online . a lot of times there are subtle differences in the way things feel or operate . i like to have the item before me so that i may better judge if it is for me . when you look at three ring binders for example you wouldn t think there would be much difference beyond size . but the wilson jones brand offers several different choices basic heavy duty d ring and ultra duty . what exactly is the difference ?basic stars the basic round ring view binder is about the standard when it comes to these three hole binders . it is white plastic covered with a clear plastic covering into which you can insert a title page or decorative art to personalize the generic binder . this clear plastic extends inside to give you two slots to use as interior folders . the three ring contraption itself is made of metal has two metal tabs to open and close and works exactly as you might expect . although perfectly acceptable for most uses the exterior plastic is a bit loose and sloppy and i wished it was a sleeker in design . i got the inch version and i liked that sizing .ultra duty stars the ultra duty round ring view finder claims to have extra durable hinges . i m not really able to ascertain what they are talking about with this assertion . i will say that the white plastic binder may seem a bit sturdier not to a whole different degree though and the covering is better adhered to the product . the metal three ring contraption is slightly different . instead of two metal tabs one on each side this has one plastic tab and is a breeze to open . i m not sure if i think this is more durable it seems a bit less so and i d be afraid of breaking the tab . i picked up both the and the inch versions and while those sizes were nice one already had a noticeable dent once again causing me to question its ultra duty moniker .heavy duty stars the heavy duty d ring view finder also states it has that extra durable hinge . i don t know about that but its feel and construction are similar to the ultra duty . the main difference here is the three ring contraption . it is set up as a d ring meaning the right edge is flat and the left edge is curved . this is really good if you plan to use this as a tool for reading because pages lay flat and nice on one side until you flip them . there are two metal tabs to open and close the unit . personally i prefer the d ring assembly because i think it keeps the pages more naturally ordered . i picked up the and inch versions of this . this is easily my favorite as you get into the larger sizes . kgharris .these tab dividers by wilson jones are colorful but attached to light weight paper . made in china . a better buy is the avery heavy duty index dividers . the paper is heavier and the edges of the tabs and the three holes are reinforced so to make them rip proof . made in usa !this is a very nice pen . it s actually identical to the famous lamy plastic bodied fountain pen except that the body is made of aluminum .i like it but frankly i like the plastic bodied pen every bit as much . it feels just as substantial as the metal pen and it costs less .bottom line this is a very nice pen but unless you just love the aluminum look for some reason i d recommend buying the plastic bodied model . same interior parts same quality lower cost .
i ve been using a dymo labelwriter twin turbo for about three years . i accidentally plugged in the wrong type of ac adapter into my usb hub and poof my printer blew out . so i ordered a new one . i can tell you that for a small home office environment and postage printing this printer will do the trick . the latest software synchronizes with your outlook contacts so it is easy breezy to create address labels for those who are in your outlook address book .i just received my replacement and there s a problem with the installation at least for windows . the disk that comes with the printer installs the software addressing stamps but does not install the driver . if you buy this printer and are running windows here s what you need to do go to dymo s website . . . and click on support drivers downloads . from here you can download the latest software and drivers and you ll be good to go . if this is a first time installation don t plug in the usb printer cable until prompted to do so by the software download .so aside from the installation problem this is a printer you can count on for the long haul provided you don t do something stupid like i did and blow it out with an incorrect ac adapter . lol !it is hard to find a printer that lists windows server as a compatible operating system . i tried some other brand printers and the drivers would refuse to install . even though canon support told me that this printer is not officially supported for server i installed the drivers anyway and it works perfect !update the rebate did finally show up but it took a month longer than promised !the printer still works and i ve applied patches that probably fix the setup bug below . brother s web site and patch software distribution is very hard to figure out but this really has been a great purchase over time . i regularly fax from it copy from it scan from it and even print from it . my wife who was quite skeptical about the value of this complex beast she s usually right to be skeptical is a huge fan .an os x update broke the abiity to send a scan to os x . i didn t fuss with this as it ended up being just as easy for me to launch the scan from os x . i m not sure this works that well with xp either today s firewalls make this hard .i gave this a star rating originally but now i d say stars . original review i have both xp and os x tiger . . machines on my home lan . i installed the brother to both machines . in both cases i downloaded the very latest software patches from brother s site .the xp install went rather well but i realized too late the downloaded drivers didn t include the ocr s . . . annoying . i d recommend doing the cd install first then downloading and updating from the downloads .the os x install was another story . actually this is pretty outrageous . bonjour was rendezvous install didn t work at all . the printer didn t appear in my network display .it took about a half hour of late night hacking and googling and amazon review reading to figure out that brother misconfigured the printer . they didn t define something called a mdns name . without this name bonjour rendezvous doesn t work .how do you define this ? well to make a long story short dig through the cd and find the help file called all engnet .pdf . chapter describes the browser interface . use your browser and the ip address of the brother to get the web ui . you need the admin un of admin and pw of access . this is publicly downloadable not secret you can chang pw . then from the home page click network configuration then click on configuremdns then name the machine brothermfc works . now you can add it as a printer .it s astounding that brother doesn t even mention this on their web site help files . it s a pretty darned serious bug .i ll add the rest of my experience later . the mac is definitely a poor cousin for this device . it does appear however that contrary to the brother specs it is possible to fax to a mac .update i ve definitely warmed to this device . i ve an evolving review with comments on both xp and os x experiences in my blog . amazon does not permit url inclusion in reviews but for more information go to google s blog search and search gordon and n .the xp support is better than the mac support but a geek armed with my review will have no trouble getting this machine working well with os x including push button scanning directly to disk ! i suspect there may be some nasty security implications here . . . it s not however a device for the average user . it really needs a geek to install and configure it .
i use this one to hold salt so when it rains freezing rain or snow and it starts to freeze to ice i can open this puppy up use a small scoop and toss salt around . i use other models to store dog cat food in my room so i can feed the pets without having to walk out to the garage to get a scoop of food . plus i use the largest one to hold the dog food in the garage .i used to just open the bags and then try and scrunch them shut but i noticed the food was drying out so i got one of these and now the food stays moist just like you opened it up right then .iris airtight pet food container navy blue quartslove having this food container since it is a pain when you have large dogs and a lot of food . this will hold more than a lb bag of your favorite food . we are currently not using the wheels since the food container does not move very often . my lab loves food and knows the sound when i open it but will not try to get it open on his own .food stays fresh but we do clean it out after every bag so that everything is freshi resisted getting this item because i was afraid it would be too low and my dogs would try to eat out of it while i was getting the food ready . i have dogs at my home right now some rescue and that live upstairs and are at my side when i am getting food ready . i did not want to have a training battle when i an busy getting food ready . however i haven t had that problem and this has been much easier than dumping a lbs bag of food in it that will fill it up than try to break the bag dog into smaller containers .
i love this leash . it s made very sturdy and the cord is thicker . my puppy was only lb . when i got the first one and she s now pounds . if she does pull i don t have to worry this will snap . the cord rolls out easily and i found a leash accessory bag from flexi here on amazon .com that makes the leash a carryall of sorts . it fits right over the carry handle and i can put treats my keys change . . . .all sorts of things in it . it has zipped sides and the pockets are not those flat kind you can t get your hand in they puff out are gathered at the top and that lets you put lots of stuff in them . this makes the flexi leash even more owner friends . yes i d highly recommend this leash .if you re interested you can get your accessory bag for your flexi leash here on amazon at this link http www .amazon .com gp product b dh ref oh details o s i great product but i unfortunately can t use it for treats .my dog is too food motivated obsessed . if she knows you have treats she ll be at your hip until they re done . instead we put her tennis ball in it and use it as a little carrier for what becomes a mud ball to and from the dog run .the material is really sturdy and i love the drawstring !the only thing i would change would be the clip . i find the clip drags down my shorts basketball shorts pj pants skirts anything without a sturdy waistband elastic waistband . it really needs to be clipped onto jeans or something with a thick sturdy waistband .instead i bought a package of carbineers and attached it to my leash . that really helped !http www .amazon .com purple aluminum carabiner keyring climbing dp b ixlwui ref sr ?ie utf qid sr keywords carabineri can t complain too much as this was not an expensive treat tote . it does the job . i wish i had been able to select the color but not a big deal . my main complaint is that the bag does not seem to sit well when i attach to any pants i am wearing . it sits loosely and gets in the way . otherwise i like that it cinches closed .

water wetter is designed to be used in a system of solely distilled water . water wetter is then added to the mix to help the water have better contact with the metal . redline s claim is that with just water air will accumulate due to the heat on the metal s surface and this does not allow maximum heat transfer to the water . the water wetter will stop that air from forming thus allowing for more cooling potential . according to their results up to degrees .now this can also be used in systems with a mixture of water and antifreeze but the results will be severly diminished down to just a couple of degrees . on top of that beware of the black sludge that can accumulate with water wetter combining with certain types of antifreeze . i would recommened using google to find results on this .redline does recommened draining and refilling the system of water wetter and water once a year . this in my opinion is due to the fact that this is designed to be used in race cars and not so much street vehicles yes even high performance street vehichles . if you are doing research you will find one over riding response if you have a cooling system problem this will not fix it . i purchased this before i did enough research . i have decided not to use the product and take a loss on the investment . my car is a street car and i was going to flush my system and use only distilled water since i live in an area that doesn t have to worry about freezing . after doing my research i will go with just a higher percentage of distilled water to antifreeze . this will help keep my maintenance time to a minimum and also increase my cooling efficiency .although i bought expensive potable water hoses for my motorhome and gave them a good rinsing before connecting them i still detected that distinctive hose taste in my rv s water . installing this filter between the hose and my rv eliminated that taste . it also filters out odd odors and tastes that i encounter with some campground water . when there are high chlorine levels in the water this filter won t get rid of all of it but it does knock it down . be sure to rinse the filter for about one minute before connecting it to your rv for the first time or you ll get black carbon powder in your water . the included flexible hose protector works perfectly enabling me to connect the filter directly to my rv water inlet without the need for any other fittings allowing me to close and lock the access door .after using one of these filters for about a year i would not consider ever connecting my motorhome to any water supply without having this filter on line .if you plan on traveling off highway and transporting extra fuel this makes transferring fuel from gas can to tank very easy . i leave my gas cans mounted on the vehicle and transfer the fuel using this hose . saves time avoids spills and keeps my hands clean ! no more lifting those pound cans and standing there waiting for them to drain !the way this works is simple . there is a valve in the end of the hose that acts as a pump to prime the hose with fuel . this enables you to siphon fuel without having to suck the fuel into the hose which would be unpleasant at the very least and potentially harmful at the worst .i insert the hose into the bottom of my gallon fuel can jiggle the hose until the fuel starts to flow and then stand by while the fuel empties into my jeep fuel tank . the only requirement for this to work is that the bottom of the hose in the supply side be higher than the other end of the hose emptying into the destination side .i ve had mine for years and it has never let me down !
works great ! my child can not open it . i have of these installed . buy the extension if you have wider opening . if you have even wider opening place a piece of wood next to the wall i added an extra piece of x for one of the wide opening in the house . it gives the extra inches needed and also protects the wall .hands free operation is very handy when you have to hold the child or carry other stuff .we have a doorway between the front room and kitchen that must be a non standard width because the gate alone is a smidge too small but when we added the extension the whole unit wouldn t fit in the doorway . it would be better design if there was an overlap of about between the two sizes .after trying different gates that all had high ratings on amazon this is my second favorite . i turned my home into my own version of a baby gate showroom to figure out which one i wanted so here s my take on three different gates .i think they are all pretty good gates it just depends on your situation and what features you re looking for . the key features that ended up making a difference to me were the width of the gate opening and the latch mechanismsummer infant sure secure extra tall gate cost extensions included gate is tall fits doorway width bar to step over gate opening this is the one that i wanted to like because i thought it was the best deal . the gate opening is about which i thought was ok but hubby wanted wider . the latch mechanism is really easy to operate and i thought kids could figure it out easily but because the gate is so tall they would probably have a hard time reaching it . it does come with its own extensions in and so it more easily fits the wider doorways . however depending on the width of your doorway this one may or may not fit as well . for example i had a lot of doorways that are about and this gate didn t end up fitting well in them because the gate without any extensions was too small and the posts had to be extended so far it didn t seem stable . and the extension was too big to add . vs . the kidco gate s extensions add . as needed . it s by far the tallest and i liked that since my daughter has been in the so far . i also just like the way the taller gate looks . it does have the highest bar across the bottom to step over . if it fits well in your doorway it is probably the best value for the money .kidco center gateway cost extensions gate is . tall fits . to . doorway width bar to step over gate opening has the widest gate opening the space you walk thru not the doorway that it fits into of any of them about . this certainly won points from my husband who was pretty irritated when walking thru some of the others . i was surprised after reading so many reviews on all these gates that there wasn t more mention of this feature . this one also had the most secure latch feature . you have to push a button to lift the handle and lift the gate over a little ledge to open it and walk thru . i figure this will absolutely be the hardest one for my little one to figure out . this gate has the most adjustable widths and therefore would probably be the strongest in most door widths . the gate has about . pieces on the ends that you can use or not with the optional extensions more . spindles as additions per box to provide the most width flexibility . because all the gates become weaker if the posts are extended too much this one seems the sturdiest in my doorways . ie . if the gate says it fits up to and your door opening is . it won t seem as sturdy as if the doorway was . it doesn t have its brand name printed on it anywhere a plus in my book so it s totally white . it has the lowest bar across the floor that you have to step over at only high seems less of a tripping risk . this is the one that has the highest rating from consumer reports . child safety gates unfortunately it also is the most expensive of the bunch at about any extensions you need . i do have to say that this one had the most confusing directions but you can still figure it out ok none of them took longer than minutes to set up . it s the shortest gate and i wish it was a little taller . all in all if you can afford the price of this one it s definitely worth it !first years hands free gate cost extensions gate is tall fits doorway width . bar to step over gate opening my gripe with this gate was primarily because the gate opening is only wide ! i m and i felt like i was going to have to really pay attention walking through it so i wouldn t end up bumping it every time . however . . . the hands free step pedal is pretty cool and worked pretty easily . i wouldn t worry about a little kid figuring it out and having enough weight to be able to push it down to open it . for me it just wasn t cool enough to overcome my issue with the gate opening width . good height to the gate . it was very sturdy in my doorway . this one did have a little ramp feature for the bar that goes across the floor that helps minimize the tripping factor . fits only up to doorways so has the best chance of needing an extension . all that being said if you really want a hands free gate and the width of the gate opening doesn t bug you try this one .all three gates seemed to fit pretty tightly in the doorways after being adjusted properly . depending on your walls and if you have moldings etc you might need to take an extra minutes to adjust them and get them straight and hanging correctly . had the same type of post for the pressure mount that is covered with a rubbery material to help it not slip on the wall . were pretty easy to set up . all look about the same from a quality point of view in other words one of them didn t look cheaper to me than the others .please remember that for safety only hardware mounted gates are considered stable enough to put at the top of stairs so don t use any of these for that . think about how you will use these gates in your house and what features you will value . good luck with your own purchase !
the fender mini electric guitar stand is not made for the fender squire mini guitar . the guitar falls through . i will have to buy a differant stand for him rendering this one useless . the fender stand for standard guitars will not work on the size ether .i use this adapter to connect my electric guitar and my acoustic guitar to my computer and it works perfectly ! ! ! very minimal buzz . . . lllove it ! ! !this cover does not fit a full size acoustic electric hohner guitar . i measured the whole at but this cover does not even come close to fitting ! it measures in diameter so check your guitar closely !

i have to reset the top of the skimmer part every day to allow it to float on the top of the water and then within hours usually it has sunk down so the whole thing is underwater again and no longer skimming the surface as intended . also you need to have a cut out on the hood to allow the adjustment knob to stick through unless you have your top water level about down from the top . i like the water level to be above the plastic band of the top of the aquarium so you dont see the water level when viewing .this is a no brainer . this absolutely does not impede the water flow . and if that is a concern of yours just cut the tip off of the middle or first attachment . the tube doesn t have to reach all the way down to the bottom that is what weekly water changes are for .this does exactly as advertized . the little ledge on the top makes it easy to slip under your litter box and it s easy to lift up and shake out over a trash can .
these pellets are smaller than the typical size betta pellets which is perfect for my betta as she is not quite an adult . i also don t have to soak them like other pellets i ve tried and she digests them just fine . i only feed her two pellets twice a day .the only thing i don t like about this product is the packaging . i only wish this came in a container where i can easily pick up the pellets with my hands and not have to pour it out . i always end up pouring too much out and then have to spend time putting the rest back inside . update may i still have this ball ! it s about years old and still in great shape . i have shelties now my older boy sheltie that i wrote about in my original review below has passed away and now i m the proud dog mom to a yr old girl sheltie lbs and a year old boy sheltie lbs . even though they aren t big dogs i m glad i have the large size biscuit ball it s a great size for them . i make homemade gluten free biscuits for them these days drying them so they re hard and crunchy and they don t fall apart easily . because of this the homemade biscuits work nicely in the biscuit ball as they re more difficult to get out of the ball compared to store bought biscuits . original review while dog biscuits don t last minutes in this ball with my sheltie this ball will keep my little boy busy for over half an hour when i fill it with mashed banana or other fruit yogurt unsweetened applesauce or his real meals ground meat with veggies and then freeze it makes him work harder for the goodies inside . i then place it either on our enclosed concrete patio that i can hose off or in his doggie playpen out on the lawn and my little guy goes nuts for it . excellent mental stimulation and much better than him just snarfing up his food in seconds from his food bowl . we ve had this over a year and a half with no signs of wear . and it cleans up in the dishwasher ! highly recommended .these are very small much smaller than the spectrum ones i regularly feed . i like them for my young bettas or for small snacks in between . all of them even those used to flakes gobble them up happily . i ve seen a couple of my shrimp pick them up to nibble on as well .
very big and roomy . folds and sets up with ease . my only complaint is that although you can remove the bottom pad the cover on it is not removeable or water proof so there is no way to wash it and feel like it s clean . there are sheets for this square play yard to purchase separately but they aren t all that cheap and sheets themselves are not waterproof . so if your baby soils through his diaper onto the mattress or your toddler has a barf fest good luck trying to get that smell out . you can spot clean with a warm rag but lets face it . poop and puke requires the washer . and you re not able to do that with this pad .this power strip cover is meant to be a baby safe product but even though i do like it and it leaves enough space for even thick cords and wide plugs my daughter can stick her hand right down in there . that fact pretty much defeats the purpose of even having the cover . but it does at least make the whole thing look less appealing to her so she doesn t bother it too much . but the slot really should be narrower .this is a very useless item . it doesn t protect children from sticking their fingers inside the cover . this is easily done even by myself through the top where the cords are supposed to come out . a child can easily unplug anything inside the cover and get their fingers inside which completely defeats it s purpose .
this mattress pad is soft but not too cushiony . also the waterproof element is located inside the pad so you don t have too much of the annoying plastic vinyl rubbing sound or feel . the pad has protected our mattress from many a baby attack .it does what it is intended to do protect mattress from wetness . but it makes you sweaty when you sleep on it .fits all avent toxic plastic bottles and the non toxic sportster magic cups . does not fit via one of the non toxic plastic bottles avent has .
i use this on my takamine and my tele . it is easy to use applies the right amount of tension and looks very cool . you can leave it clipped on the headstock when not using it . cheaper ones will work but i wanted to try it out . i do like itgoing to these from what i was using i can fit more pedals on my pedalboard so mission accomplished !i got it to have it if i needed it . i have found that i don t really need it that often and rarely use it . if i was really good i can see the need . but this is a keyboard not an organ .
like many other people sitting at a desk is awkward for me it seems as if the chair has to be high up to reach the desk resulting in the floor seeming to be too low . i usually end up sitting cross legged or with my feet resting on the chair legs . this foot rest allows foot angles that feel natural and it virtually lifts up the floor ! it has four rubber like pads on the base to help keep it from shifting around and a rubber like top to keep your feet in place . the width is wide enough that many foot positions can be used . right out of the box the one i received was set at the perfect tension so that i can adjust the angle using only my feet resulting in being able to adjust foot rest positions as needed .while it s more functional than decorative in style it looks better in person than in photos and virtually disappears when underneath a desk . the metal is gray and the rubber like sections are black . there s a little m brand sticker on the front left corner but it s easily removed if unwanted .because my current desk has a pull out keyboard tray which extends the depth of the desk space when it s in use it s a bit awkward to move the foot stool back and forth by getting beneath the desk . i need to move it forward when using the desk and back when not using it . without doing this i am unable to push the desk chair underneath the desk . this maybe wouldn t be an issue however with a desk where the keyboard rests atop the main surface . fuzzy wuzzy s summary highly recommended with warm fuzzies !packaging style appearance excellent fuzzies ratingconstruction build quality excellent fuzzies ratingcompetitive pricing value average not good not bad fuzzies rating positives high build quality with good welds and smooth semi gloss black enamel coating . strong steel tubular legs can support up to pounds . if you use this as a laptop riser stand by placing a laptop on the top shelf the surface is perforated with many holes to allow for great air circulation and heat dissipation . negatives there are no negatives with this product this is an excellent solidly built steel stand that both looks attractive with its uniform semi gloss black enamel coating and can support a large computer display monitor or any other item weighing up to pounds . you can either place this on your desk or on a table or countertop e .g . some people have a computer in their kitchen to organize your computer laptop keyboard display layout better .this monitor stand weighs . pounds and has outer dimensions of . width x . depth x . height . the top shelf has surface dimensions of . width x . depth . the space underneath the shelf is . wide which is the . outer width minus the width of the two tubular legs . the space underneath the shelf has a usable height of . which is the . outer height minus the height of the tubular metal that supports the top shelf .even though this is advertised as a monitor stand i am using this as a laptop stand placing a inch laptop on top of the shelf . my computer desk already has a raised shelf where my two display monitors are positioned and my desk has an adjustable keyboard tray where my keyboard and mouse reside . i have multiple desktop and laptop computers so sometimes i place one laptop underneath this stand s shelf with its lid closed and a vga cable connecting that laptop to a larger monitor and another inch laptop sits on the top shelf of this stand . when placing a laptop on this stand where i use a separate bluetooth keyboard instead of the laptop s own keyboard the stand s perforated metal surface functions like a ventilated platform to help cool the laptop . since many laptops have their fan intake vents located underneath the laptop it is advantageous that this stand s shelf surface is a perforated metal grill to allow for great air circulation all along the bottom of the laptop . most of the other laptop riser stands are either made of flimsy plastic or metal mesh that is too thin with too much flex in the structure .but regardless of whether you need to place a large display monitor a large laptop or other item this stand serves as a simple sturdy and modern looking support .my review title says it all . this footrest offers all i could ask for .designthis footrest is wide and sturdy which is nice if you adjust your feet position a lot during the day . it has a nonslip surface on top for your feet and four nonslip pads on the bottom so it doesn t slide around on your floor which is low pile carpet in my office s case . you can adjust the height up an inch by loosing some wingnuts sliding the top up into a higher notched position in the track and tightening the wingnuts again . you can also tighten the other nuts to make it harder to tilt . it is fine by default but i checked ! materialsthe construction is all metal with recognizable hardware holding it together . it is lightweight but strong and does not look cheap though who s looking at your footrest anyway ! . overall i would recommend this footrest enthusiastically especially over a plastic footrest at or near the same price point .
pros works really well and is easy to use . the sound quality is excellent and bypass works fine too . it is amazing how you can add layers upon layers without any loss of quality .cons it takes a bit to get accustomed to the timing not lest because the switch is somewhat sticky and requires some extra effort which has an impact on the timing . also the led is placed too close to the switch so you tend to cover it up with your foot . they should have put it higher up right next to the dial .overall impression the positive aspects completely outweigh the minor negatives . it s a great and inexpensive looper .i debated between picking up this and the zoom h n and went with the tascam i just couldn t justify the extra or so for the zoom . the unit is simple to use and the built in microphones do a great job . i picked it up because i wanted a portable unit that would let me use inch inch and xlr microphones with my dslr or capture great audio on its own . this accomplishes all of that although i need to use an adapter for inch mics for the inch ports there is no inch mic port which seems an odd omission . the unit is almost entirely plastic which can feel a bit inexpensive i know that one selling point of the h n is its sturdy construction . still it seems well made and i think it s a fantastic recorder for the price .this is simply one of the best velcro tapes out there . it is very well made and resistant to hold every pedal imagined . i would recommend to get a few roles of power grip pedalboard velcro as it definetely holds your pedals much better than the industrial velcros included in most pedal boards and a one meter roll around feet wont last long especially if you have a combination of both regular size mxr or boss and bigger pedals like a cry baby wah or a vox satchurator or time machine reverb or similar . you probably have a few thousand dollars invested in great pedals even rare ones so this would be great for you to keep them well attached to your board and properly organized . maybe the tape could be made a bit wider perhaps an inch more would be great . it would actually increase a bit the sticking surface . still a great product concept . a must buy !
save your paint buy the door gards for your jeep the only thing i can say is make sure you clean the door jam first and make sure you have lined up and its easy if read the instruction don t just peel the cover off and try and stick it on you will miss place the guards where you want them then pull on the clear tape and the cove will come off then just push downthis is the oem cabin air filter for the acura tl and trust me this thing does what it s supposed to do . i couldn t believe how much crud this thing had caught between the b service on my girlfriend s tl .one thing i will say is that this is a pita to replace . after disconnecting the glove compartment door and removing the two screws and push fittings securing the assembly to the console pull the console down . directly down . that means sit in the passenger seat and apply equal force to both sides of the assembly . . . or you ll break a tab and your interior will never be the same . i ve seen two people make the mistake of busting the tabs loose right to left . don t be another .these work great .only need a small flat tip screw driver to pull back on the clips to remove the old ones and install the new ones . don t remove the clips completely just pull them back a little bit and lift the hood gently at the same time . people makes this a flash .
container is made in a pretty heavy duty plastic the hinge where the lid connects to the container is pretty weak but aside from that the rest is pretty well made . the lid has a strip of rubber foam along the outside edge where it comes into contact with the lid of the container which provides an airtight seal .generally speaking pretty easy to use and is as described .i like the clip the size and the durable nylon exterior . also i can close off the top with the pull cord .i orderd this for my g tall . the picture is deceiving . there is a front piece of glass and a back piece of glass and then a small piece of plastic . if you have a hob filter or anything somewhat big you will not be able to use this canopy . junk .
didn t realize that this had a lb capacity and ft lbs for the tongue weight . i m using this on my travel trailer so i can take all our bicycles which all three bikes and bike rack make up a tongue weight of lbs . a great buythese things are rated lbs but that s for gvw so while it s correct technically in reality each item is rated by the label at lbs per each item and if you had they sell them in pairs if you had of them you could put lbs on them technically and according to them . i should not have to rely on user reviews to get the individual weight rating ! ! ! ! gvw is a very deceptive and dangerous way to market and label these products . consider this on a truck the majority of the weight is on the front two wheels while the rear wheels don t have as much weight same is true on a front wheel vehicle . this leads to situations where you could overextend the capacity of these products .i d like a very clear rating lbs lbs lbs for each stand or ramp on amazon so that i know how much weight i can safely put on it similar to what is found on jacks . . . .a jack is not labeled as lbs if it can lift a gvw vehicle lbs means that the jack can lift lbs !after all i m planning to get under these things ! ! ! !on items like this where someone s life very literally depends on the labeling it would be really really really nice and a legal requirement that the specifications on amazon very clearly stated both the operating weight maximium weight and crush failure weight per each ramp stand versus this gvw rating which is deceptive and just plain dangerous .i have very literally found people working underneath lbs trucks without the wheels using jack stands sold as ton when in reality each jack stand was only rated at ton or lbs . . . . .their comment back this is a ton stand and lbs gvw divided by is lbs or ton plenty of margin . when in reality lbs are up front . . . . lb for each wheel and each stand rated at only lbs . . . .making their jack stand overloaded ! horrendously scary all because marketing is so bad in this area . yes people should exercise care in using double protection and users should always read their instructions and warning before putting their life on the line but for the love of god there is a responsibility on the makers and marketers of these products to label them very clearly and in bold with the weight that each can hold and amazon should post that weight for each item in bold yellow or orange wording with very clear warnings .amazon and automotive sellers on amazon need to get on the ball regarding the needs of auto ethusiasts and for the safety of the weekend mechanic who should not have to do complex math to figure out how much weight each item can hold !we really need to get away from gvw it s deceptive and dangerous ! i should not have to rely on user reviews to get the individual weight rating ! ! ! ! nice lightweight solution .reduces endless cranking of the front trailer jack .my trailer only weighs a thousand pounds .what more words !
it will not make a regular octagon even if you have panelsthe problem is it only opens to certain angles and degrees is not one of themit only does and but degrees is good for a hexagon just don t think if you have to have any old number of panels you can make any polygon you want you can t . . additionally the square which you can make with the degree angles are not very strong and not recommended by the instructions especially if you are thinking i can have use panels to make a square it will be very flimsy in the middle of the straight junction . . they specifically say do not do that have sides joined at a degree angle . . basically a hexagon is about all it really works for . . though a sided square works it isn t weak it is just tiny . . so you can have an sided fencebut the angles will have to be half and half degreeswhich is more of a square just with bent sidesnot a real regular stop sign type octagon ! plus it s a little flimsyand no matter what the shape is there is no way to have an easy open close gate you have to either step over it or take a side apart every time very hard when i bought it the store guy said oh what kind of dogs do you have . . ? hmalsowhen your kids get to about months or so they can either move the sides by walking while pushing on a side which changes the angle you had it set to or just lifting it and crawling undergood for babiestoddlers not so mucheither fix it to the floor somehow or accept that they will escapedogs might do that tooespecially just dig under or root it up with their nose and go underwlei use this along with a water proof mattress pad to minimize the number of times i have to launder everything and it is fantastic . it does exactly what it is supposed to do without problems of any kind . and my kids don t really even know it is there .this net does what it says . i don t really like that you have to screw into the railing but a child s safety is way more important . it was also a little wonky to size down the length . i wouldn t say it s too stylish either but a person would be hard pressed to find a stylish railing guard . at the end of the day it does what it says and keeps the kid from falling though the railing .
while the mounting of objects on walls is a great use for double sided tape its unintended uses are also very practical .being able to test fit components with this type of tape before final glued assembly is particularly handy . just be aware that the tape can pull off the top surface of any layered material .you can attach a fairly heavy object anywhere you want on a smooth strong surface . an open end wrench from a model t is currently attached to my toolbox fascia strictly for aesthetic purposes .most often i use it for securing small rubber feet pads at the bottom of items that live on tabletops as well as securing shims of wood cork plastic cardboard metal rubber etc . onto the bottom of uneven items .if you need to re attach or re orient an object that had a single use peel off sticky surface originally applied this tape is your friend . the most common usage in that category is the deer whistles re attachment on my car s front bumper . i always seem to find them on the ground where i park . take the time to remove any residual gunk with a goo gone dissolve it like solvent and then some alcohol to get rid of any oily film first .just appreciate that this tape is permanent in the sense that disassembling the pieces it connects may damage them . you need to pry things off very slowly and carefully . it is also almost structural at the scale of flimsy plastic components which seems to describe most objects these days .there is another variant heavy duty double sided tape colored red rather than white for more massive items and those that you d prefer to not ever come loose . it works almost like an epoxy . i used some most recently for attaching a rubber foam door seal intended for a garage door s bottom edge as a threshold on a tile floor year on and it s still holding .also don t throw the packaging away since it lists the strength of the adhesive which is very convenient when you want to calculate how much to use . wide tape is also available .this product is an indispensable item in my toolbox fabrication drawer . i don t use much but even a small piece is oftentimes invaluable .there are times when flat tape just isn t appropriate . especially when one or both surfaces aren t completely smooth or flat . this is what you need . i have some wiremold that holds electrical wires to a baseboard and when it came time to attach it i knew exactly that type of tape i needed . the slight sponginess to the material forgives any imperfections in the items to be adhered . regular tape just leaves gaps .it is difficult to remove though . the thickness of the material will often result in removing only a layer of it so be careful where you mount with it . on the other hand when things don t stick with regular tape this is what you need . btw for wet applications and others where i want less permanence i have used thecommand adhesivemounting strips . they come inwater resistant too . they are only tabs . . .so it takes a few to hang things while this is a nice long uninterrupted roll where you can choose your own size . this is just a product that serves its particular purpose perfectly ! !the scotch super strength packaging tape is strong resistant to tearing and definitely heavy duty . it doesn t stick to your fingers but it stays stuck on cardboard and any other smoother surfaces . just one wrap around a shipping box should hold it . any attempt to remove the tape will rip off the top thin layer of the cardboard . now that s strong . and it s clear . the tape also cuts easy and doesn t roll up into itself . highly recommended .
sounds a lot more than what you expect this is my nd honeytone one at home one at work . you can use it with batteries or with a v adapter it has a clip to hang it on your belt or wherever you want it also has a headphones input . it gets way to distorted at high volume but come on . . . it s a amp it does what it has to and does it well .this is a superb tremolo pedal its dials allow for enormous control of the effect . it s very sturdy an often noted feature of boss pedals . further it s utterly easy to use allows for both v battery and power supply adapter operation and most important of all it delivers beautiful tremolo . note it comes with a v battery installed but it does not come with a power source adapter . if the price is more than you re willing to pay consider the danelectro cool cat tremolo . this also delivers good tremolo but it does not allow for as much sound manipulation as the boss product it s still quite good but the boss takes the prize . i paid about for mine and have zero regrets .great for the price . it is a very accesible option and does what it has to do . must have for solos

i have to reset the top of the skimmer part every day to allow it to float on the top of the water and then within hours usually it has sunk down so the whole thing is underwater again and no longer skimming the surface as intended . also you need to have a cut out on the hood to allow the adjustment knob to stick through unless you have your top water level about down from the top . i like the water level to be above the plastic band of the top of the aquarium so you dont see the water level when viewing .it heats up but without a thermostat its tricky . when adhered to the bottom underside of my son s leopard gecko gallon tank it got the floor of the tank too hot about f . i had a vinyl tile and reptile carpet in the bottom of the tank but it was too hot . i ended up moving up to a gallon tank and i very carefully peeled this from the bottom of the tank . they say not to do it but it wasn t really too difficult and it works fine . on the new setup i raised the gallon tank up on some inch thick boards and slid a ceramic tile underneath the warm end of the tank . i laid the heater on top of the tile with the sticky side up towards the underside of the tank floor but not actually stuck on about below the floor of the tank . i also added another layer of material similar to reptile carpet under the reptile carpet . now the temperature is perfect in the daytime . i turn the heater off at night and use a zoo med nocturnal infrared incandescent heat lamp watts for nighttime heat . it works pretty well .this let me extend my aqua clear filter for my tall tank so i could clean more towards the bottom of the tank .
i bought this because i was in need of one for my car . it is simple to use and does the job for an inexpensive tire gauge . you can use it to measure your current tire gauge as well as deflate your tire if you have too much air .these caps fit on top of the tri lynx levelers tri lynx lynx leveler or by themselves for under stabilizer jacks or the hitch jack if you have a light trailer . they can also be used on top of the levelers for under the tire s to level your rv . i don t know how much weight they can bare but they do well with my lb trailer for all of the uses described above .it s a leveler . what more do you need to know really . you can roll your trailer onto it to level it out worked for me ! just make sure to check weight of your load you plan on putting on it .
i know most won t think this matters but i was curious of this question myself . i measured the rear compartment of the aquapod beforehand and the measurements for this pump were a little bigger . i bought it anyway and use it as a back up pump in my gallon tank . the pump is strong too strong for the nano but fine for the gallon and can be a primary pump for a larger tank with no problems . if you re looking for a strong pump this is the one . again the pump will not fit in the rear compartment of the nano . the pump can be attached to the glass or work with under gravel filters also as it comes with a lot of extra adapters .i have an unusual use case for this pump . i have four fish tanks with tropical fish . cleaning them can be a chore . i prepare water in a gallon container add chlorine killer adjust ph heat water in winter . after using the gravel vac to remove about half of the water i was using a small three quart bucket to tote water to refill the tanks . not too bad for gallon tank but with a gallon tank it s a lot of toting . and bending over . my back was not too happy doing this . so i got a ft of clear tubing and this pump . i drop the pump into the bucket and just sit and watch while the pump does all the work ! i purchased this pump because i needed to pump the water from floor level to about . feet and this model was rated for that level . my large gallon tank fills in minutes which is just right . i don t use this pump every day but it has been doing it s job flawlessly for almost three years and it is still working well pumping water uphill . this was an economical way to fill my fish tanks and i m very happy with it .this thing is bullet proof ! nice design and really powerful ! great value for just over . i never used the bio wheels because i only use this pump as a water polisher for tank maintenance . i actually wrap the polishing filter with a hepa filter . micron and it powers through the cycling of the water . i m sure other canister filters couldn t do that ! to move the water through that filter takes power that this pump has ! i couldn t be happier with the purchase ! highly recommend this canister filter !
i use the zoo med reptile lamp stand in conjunction with the zoo med mini combo deep dome lamp fixture . it works great and i have had no issues so far over the six months that i have owned it . the bottom of the stand slides right under your reptile terrarium . you can adjust the height of the stand depending on how far or close you want the lamps to your terrarium and it also has places to clamp the lamp cords .this is rods with a connector for the center with suction cups .it works great . bubbles are very evenly distributed and i have a betta who enjoys surfing the bubble wall .works great holds the treats and clip to my belt easy i also like the closable tie on the side .
perfect for exhaust work . i bought it for a catalytic converter and o sensor project because it is rated for f to ffits my john deere lawn tractor which is model la and likely it fits all the l la and d series lower end john deere tractors . please post a comment if it does not and i ll update this reviewcurrently amazon says it does not fit my third generation miata nc but it doesthese filters come top in most online filter tests and i use them in almost all my carspurchased this as an oe replacement per the factory manual for a honda powered snow thrower and it works just fine !
i am currently using the adapters to connect my medela symphony kit to my avent bottles .cons . the adapters leak where it screws into the bottle . it is very annoying to pump and still leak milk all over your clothes .pros . it can be used with medela kits .this conversion kit allows me to pump into the large oz avent bottles which is very helpful as the medela bottles only allow up to oz .i use this to pump with mypump in style advanced breast pump backpackand pump directly into my avent bottles . so glad i got this because i was sick of pumping into the medela bottles came with my pump then transferring the milk into the avent bottles so giving me extra bottles to wash all the time ! just make sure you still use the ring to seal the converter to your bottle or you will spill your milk everywhere ! i learned that the hard way !
the ones i received are not identical to the picture . one can only be installed on the side and the other can only be installed on the front or back . the markings are different for left to right level vs front to back level .received within days . saw mythbusters do a test of these lifehammers and they worked quite well cutting through the seatbealt and any of the windows except the windshield . commit that to memory ! in a emergency situation it will not easily crack or break the windshield side and rear glass only . mine is getting mounted in clear sight and access from the front seat right in the middle of the rear seat benches so as to be easily grabbed by all ! i have had experience with a stuck seat belt and they are a bitch to cut through with a semi sharp pockt knife .easy to mount and adjust . since each one is made identical there is no right or left you just mount the mirror differently one has the tensioner lever right next to the mirror drivers side in my case . that is not a problem if you place it back from your mirror . good sturdy mount and no vibration . once adjusted they are easy on and off .
this is a good looking and sturdy water bowl food bowl for a dog . best for a smaller dog or puppy .this is a good looking and sturdy water bowl food bowl for a dog . better for a larger bread it holds a lot of food or water .my fish love this also contains larger flakes specially produced for some large cichlids . enhances my fishcolor as well .
i had a medela single electric pump and therefore only had one shield . my sister let me borrow her double electric pump in style so i needed another shield . this works perfectly . i already had the tubing that i needed with the pump in style . i m glad i didn t have to buy a whole replacement set to use the borrowed pump .i had this pump on my registry but then was also given a double electric pump medela pump in style all i can say is good thing i had the double pump ! this single electric one just cannot get enough pressure suction whatever . plus even if it did work a single pump means double the pumping time . i know double electric pumps are expensive but beg borrow get your family to go in it as a gift you need it and this single pump is not an adequate substitute for a real pump ! you can even rent a double pump from the hospital or a lactation consultant . just don t bother trying this one .bought these because we were using a medela pump and philips bottles . of course the breast pump and bottle industry can t make it easy for everything to work together . these adapters fit great onto the pump and the philips bottles . don t feel forced to buy all new bottles or a brand new pump just to make your system work !
i received my order today and as other have mentioned there is only one cap although the pictures show a package containing two . i re read the information given and it does not make it clear that there is only one . at that number the price is outrageous . go to a pet store . they are much cheaper there .looked like a good deal . when i received the filter in its box i thought the item was missing . what i thought was packing material was the filters x black sheets of foam . the ad pic shows black and white and says pack of . don t think this is worth it consider another product and company . major rip off .when purchasing this kitty kap patented you are receiving one cap . others have mentioned it and i will post pictures .this is a good cap for the larger . ounce cans and i have not tried it for the smaller cans but it should work . i paid nearly . for the top but i thought i was getting two of them . i hope the seller will make it clearer that the buyer is receiving only one .the plastic is thick and durable and the design with the ridges to fit every can seem to be reasonable . i did want to make note that there was a sticker inside the lid that states intended for pets only keep out of the reach of children ? ? ? ? what about covering a can of human food . . . is that a problem ?why ? does it have something to do with lead content in the plastic ? if so please state this . why the warning or clarification sticker make this clear in the description .the product seems nice but i am giving it three stars for the amazon presentation the outlandish price and the warning sticker .keeping them honest .
i have this paired with the behringer c studio condenser microphone . it matches the mic well color wise and fit . the c fits the mount perfectly . i recommend this mount highly .http www .amazon .com behringer c studio condenser microphone dp b cz rlk ref sr ?ie utf qid sr keywords behringer c this ac adapter in my opinion should not even qualify to be reviewed since we all know it should be included with the product it is powering . that being said it functions as it was intended to which is to power a yamaha psre key portable keyboard . it fits perfectly and stays put all while transmitting electrical current from my home s v outlet into the aforementioned yamaha keyboard . thanks for reading .sposhould you need to connect a condenser microphone to a phantom power box so that it will work with an ordinary amplifier or mixer without phantom supply this is a good length for the link .
i have installed several hitches in the past and this is the first one that i have ordered that did not include a ball mount . . . this review would have been stars if i didn t have to go out on my own and buy the ball mount as well . didn t have it listed as included but i just bought a curt mount for my lexus gs which one was included . . . lesson here is if you plan to install and use on the same day order a ball mount as well . install was a total pita ! ! the bolts holes used to mount the hitch itself were rusted to no end mdx and the only way for me to get the bolts in was to use one of the old ones that held up the tow hook you remove and using that as a thread cutter with wd . . . i also used an old round plastic brush and brushed the threads with lubricant as well ! ! install took almost hours due to this unforeseen problem .because i ordered this device along with a backup camera for my rv . however when i went to install the backup camera their instructions said not to install it if there is a back up alarm installed . the only reason that i could think of was that the current draw of both the camera and the alarm my exceed the fuse capacity of the backup lights and cause it to fail . anyway i am further researching this and hope to get this resolved soon . so the product looks good and is well packaged . but i have not tried it yet .i haven t had the need to install this yet but plan to this summer . i always use acdelco parts when working on my gmc because i know i can t go wrong with genuine gm parts ! i will update this review once i install it . thanks amazon for having acdelco in stock when i need parts for my truck .edit installed this along with theacdelco idler pulleyfor my gmc sierra x . tip if working on a similar truck make sure you remove the top half of the radiator shroud to make it easy to get to everyting . install is pretty straight forward .
when you need a phone during an emergency or power outage when you want a phone that is reliably located on the base where someone hasn t walked away with the handset this is the ideal phone ! the phone comes with a longish cord to plug into the phone base and phone jack . if you need the standard short cord to use with a typical wall mounted base there is a slot under the base to wrap the cord instead of providing a shorter second cord . i like this ! it s nice that companies are engineering with cost savings in mind ! the phone comes with pulse and tone dialing needed to use computerized dialing . phone looks and works fine . if you are looking for an affordable wall phone this is the one . just be sure to read the instructions concerning wall mount mode !what a clean look for a cork board . it has a smooth light oak frame and plenty of room for pinning . it came with hanging hooks nails but i choose to use the command brand picture hanging strips . wish the board had come with that type of hanging hardware as i dislike the damage hooks nails do to my walls . also if a couple of push pins had been included that would have been nice .it is not a heavy board so it doesn t take heavy hooks hanging strips to put it up . this will definitely keep my papers where i need them .
 easy tear out pages very sturdy plastic cover pockets are in the front of the notebook right behind the cover the back of the notebook is a thick cardboard not the plastic cover materiala winner !this mouse pad works great with my optical mouse . it isn t thick and bulky nor is it a slippery vinyl pad . it s the perfect size to sit next to my keyboard along with my bead filled wrist cushion . it is a comfortable mouse pad covered with a soft polyester fabric attached to a non skid sponge rubber base . the texture provides good control for my mouse . for me it s the perfect mouse pad it s a nice color and the price is right too !paper pads you write on them . these are nice and not flimsy with a good stiff back . only shrink wrapped and not overpackaged which is a plus to me .
works just like it needs to . perfect fit for the tailgate on my chevy when the oem clip busted .good bungies nice compact cover can litteraly fit in from fork pouch thin but protective and fit a dyna glide without windshield very wellexactly what was offered fit nicely no major prep work won t fade or crack adjusts perfectly easy removal and fits under seat in truck
acco binder clips in all sizes are good binder clips . they come in large medium small and mini sizes . have used them for years .these medium duty boxes are ideal for most storage requirements . very easy to assemble . the advantage of using standard size boxes is the uniform size . the size is ideal for books papers books and whatever else you might have that requires permanent or temporary storage .i have been looking all over for a to z file dividers just this size . they are great quality material i am ordering another set for a different file box . i wish they had a larger size for letter size files .
these dry erase markers worked perfectly and were very easy to wipe off without leaving behind any residue on my dry erase boards . i have one warning though . a colleague saw me open the package of markers and he told me don t leave them in a hot car ! because all of his quartet brand dry erase markers dried out completely and he had to throw them away .i tried these markers on a dry erase board at least once a day for three weeks before i wrote this review .these four dry erase markers are very easy to use they require no shaking or prepping and as long a you store them horizontally they don t dry or gum up . the chisel tip is an angled tip that allowed me to write in either a thin or thick line .one common problem i ve had with markers in the past is what i perceive as a horrible smell but these are odor free . i have a fairly sensitive nose so this is a real problem for me but i could use these without annoyance . the ink also wipes very cleanly off the dry erase board i use daily on my refrigerator .i bought these for my kindergartners to learn to write on their lined white board . i wanted them because they are larger than than most dry erase markers and because they are shaped not to roll .they work well . the caps are actually a bit strange to work with but aren t a detraction from using the pens . the colors are a bit streaky which leaves a lot to be desired . also they don t wipe away completely . most dry erase markers now clean very well . with a dry cloth you can barely tell anything was on the board . these leave colorful smears that don t come off with merely a dry cloth . so yes they wipe off with a dry cloth though not cleanly .in all they work fine . if you want a cleaner board without having to use a cleaner on it don t get these markers .
i am satisfied with this product and what it does because we all know how rust is and if we don t let me say it can be a pain in the but you know what i m trying to say so to expect miracles would be beyond expectations .will use again .glad i went with the chrome and not the black one i hooked this one up to my gv motorcycle if you have just a little know how you can do it your self all you will need to go with this is a relay that does not come with it . you can get it on here or any part store i have made many people jump due to the sound of the horns loudness .how can one really rate it as it is used for protection and no idae how long it should last yet is was as listed so i give it the benifit ogf the doubt . . .
this is intended to replace a mim screw stratocaster bridge . it only comes with the bridge no body screws no back springs no arm . . . nothing . that s why it s so inexpensive . what you see in the picture is what you get .but that being said it a great value if you want to spruce up your mim strat . the block is huge compared to a standard mim bridge . it was incredibly easy to install . and the sustain is improved .one tip which i forgot do not tighten the screws into the body all the way . the bridge has to be loose enough for the bridge to move like a hinge . the springs in the back keep it back . the string tension keeps it balanced in the front . what i did was tighten the body screws all the way and then loosened them one turn back .i have a taylor ce and this strap had to be forced over the top connection near the neck of the guitar . rather than ruin the finish of the guitar i just got a different strap . plus the nylon slips very easy which is not a plus for me since i had to keep correcting the position of the guitar to where i liked it to play . if the nylon is not a problem for you and the ends fit over your guitar this strap is very well made .this neck plate rides on the body of a mexico made jazz bass which i acquired second hand replacing the blank factory plate . it could be thicker it deformed somewhat when the screws were snugged up . still the guitar now sports the old sixties fender f logo .
this printer may be an ink hog i ll reserve judgment on that but the setup to connect the hp printer to my router via ethernet cable and use it wirelessly with my apple macbook running os . . .for over a year i ve been unable to use my old network printer setup due to changes in apple s software though it could be a configuration issue with my home network my failure to sacrifice a goat before reinstalling the print server or the phase of the moon who knows ? . at any rate i decided that this printer would be the best solution to the problem considering the age of my old hp .the new all in one has a considerably smaller footprint on the desk though it is a less sturdy machine than the old pound tank . i had installed the software from hp s website the night before the printer arrived so the actual setup took less than minutes and the printer was recognized immediately .print quality is excellent even at the most ink stingy quality .this is without question the best type ink to use in a hp printer . . . . . . . . . . . . . . we use nothing but hp printers in our home operation .it is hard to find a printer that lists windows server as a compatible operating system . i tried some other brand printers and the drivers would refuse to install . even though canon support told me that this printer is not officially supported for server i installed the drivers anyway and it works perfect !
after recently purchasing a new hp printer i had to get this ink cartridge . compared to the old lexmark printer i had this ink cartridge is a bargain . it only costs around compared to the for the color lexmark cartridges i used to have to buy . i don t print many colored documents at home so for me this cartridge is just right . the colored documents i have printed have come out looking professionally done with no smears or smudges . however if you have a lot of colored documents to print or pictures you ll be better suited to buy a laser printer or pay to have your photos and large colored documents printed somewhere else . hp brand name used with my hp photo printer colors seem to really take to this paper . it s totally different than just printing photos on computer paper sheets at this price is more than fair considering i don t use this paper that often remember when printing photos ink will be more expensive than the paper it goes quick on high quality settings quality photos when printed !this number tri color ink cartridge by hewlett packard is an essential for those of us who use the hp deskjet d printer or any other printer that accepts this cartridge .the three colors of yellow red and blue well maybe it s a bluish green can be combined by the printer to produce a wide array of other colors very effectively . the cartridge takes up little space if you care to stock up on them and it comes well packaged so that it won t break during shipment . moreover the installation and removal of the cartridge is very easy so when changing the ink cartridge you will rarely have any difficulty .if you care to save some money you can buy this ink cartridge in the same package as a black ink hp this would be even more cost efficient . the ink goes faster than you would think it would go !overall the quality of the ink is rather good despite my one complaint that the ink goes faster than i would like it to go . the cartridge provides you with the ability to print a multitude of colors on your paper and replacement is easy .
i bought these for a cheap price on amazon but when i ran out i purchased the generic brand at wal mart for a few dollars cheaper than the playtex brand they work just as well and do the same thing .i connected two different brands a double jeep and single ? brand which are two different heights . it was slightly difficult especially since the double didn t have much room to put the middle connector on . . but it works ! it s not like a smooth push or anything but it is smooth with same size brand ones i have another same brand single lol but it s worth it ! love !i am a huge fan of sleepsacks and after buying many brands i have found halo to be the best brand for wearable blankets .
this works with our avent bottles . it did leak a tiny bit but what sippy top doesn t . we had trouble using it with ourpura stainless steel bottles . they will fit but with quite a bit of coercion . all other avent sprouts nipples that we used have fit the pura bottles so not sure why these are different .i did not buy this but i have the medela pump in style . thanks to those who mentioned that the evenflo nipples would fit the bottles but it s the evenflo classic nipples that fit not the evenflo elite nipples . now i just need to find caps that would fit without having to buy this whole set .this is an good product little loose for medela oz oz bottles that we have . they almost dont fit the nipple rings of the medela bottles the nipples come out of the ring when my son handles them a little rough and all the milk starts pouring out . we had to use these nipples with enfamil nipple rings capsenfamil slow flow soft nipple countthe only down side is these caps dont take or have any caps .but there is one big advantage of these nipples which is they dont get stuck like other nipples . my baby is used to pinching on the nipple hard other nipples get stuck due to vacuum and milk doesn t pass . this one doesn t get stuck because of the tooth inside the nipple . i wish it fit the medela bottle a little better . it is said to be good for colic babies not sure how exactly that works .i would recommend this if your kid has the same problem as mine . the only thing is that you have to be sure that it fits you bottle these are the standard ones . i think one good test is if the free standard nipples that come with those ready to feed similac bottlessimilac advance newborn ready to feed fluid ounces pack of packaging may vary or above mentioned enfamil nipples fit you bottles then these will fit your bottles as well .
i bought this item for the battery tender . hook it up to the battery terminals and plug it in the battery tender .connected two of these cables to charge my battery on my truck battery charger unit is in garage works perfect .i originally purchased the deltran battery tender jr . to keep the battery on my vehicle charged as it s advertised of being capable of doing so on the packaging . this battery tender did not charge the battery on my car within the hour window and turned off has a built in timer . i called deltran and was told by customer service that the deltran battery tender jr . was too small to use on a car truck battery and that i should have purchased the deltran battery tender plus . i eventually purchased the deltran battery tender plus and the deltran . ft . extension lead dbt . the deltran battery tender jr . works fine on my walk behind lawn mower with electric start and should be fine for anything with a small battery . i would suggest that you purchase the deltran battery tender plus so you can have the option of using it on more equipment . deltran should change the label on the deltran battery tender jr . if it s not really intended for car truck batteries . check out batterytender .com for deltrans complete line .

this notebook has two lines at the top with spaces for the date and the page . oddly the pages if you count both sides don t have preprinted numbers . the rest of the page has a two column format with rather faintly preprinted numbered lines on the right side and a narrower column of unlined space at the left . each page is perforated so you can easily tear it out at need . the covers are sturdy plastic ? . the paper is of acceptable quality for an item you will probably discard once it s full . useful for anyone who frequently wants to hand write lists or even instructional steps with annotations .this college rules graph paper is filler paper meaning it can be inserted into a three ring binder . each sheet has a reinforced strip on it to prevent it ripping out of the binder . the thickness of the paper is adequate and as i expected . the lines on the paper are perfectly consistent throughout the package and they are dark enough . this graph paper is double sided and has different size graph lines on the front and back . on the front one square inch of paper contains squares and on the back one square inch of paper contains squares on it . overall the price is a little high for only sheets but you get both sides of the paper so it s like getting sheets of cheaper single side graph paper . this is very good paper and we like it a lot .this item is x inches . an a z index is included . not every letter has its own pocket . there are slots . each slot holds a pretty fair amount of paper . i only use standard computer paper in these files therefore i am unsure about other paper sizes . yet for my needs no paper sticks out above the file s top . the pockets are deep .the closing flap is thin . i have to pull to get the flap s lock to come loose so i do not expect the closing flap to last too long . the color is a dark blue which makes reading the slot labels letters a bit difficult .all in all this is a good product if your eyesight is good .
the pad itself is perfect for today s laser mice . tracking is spot on . the gel rest provides excellent support for the wrist . m also includes little rubber feet so you can angle to pad to your liking .the pad is made from a composite plastic and has non skid pads on the bottom . the mouse area has a distinctive surface for precise laser mouse control .this pad is excellent for gamers as well .this mouse pad works great with my optical mouse . it isn t thick and bulky nor is it a slippery vinyl pad . it s the perfect size to sit next to my keyboard along with my bead filled wrist cushion . it is a comfortable mouse pad covered with a soft polyester fabric attached to a non skid sponge rubber base . the texture provides good control for my mouse . for me it s the perfect mouse pad it s a nice color and the price is right too !this pad is soft and is this it s the perfect mouse pad . the top is fabric but that s great the mouse always works on this .
it tunes my ukuleles ! it tunes my guitar ! i can even see how close my voice is to being on pitch ! hooray for this tuner .this unit works as advertised . i ve used it to record my garage band shows . making a simple recording and transferring it to a computer for storage and playback is easy to accomplish for a novice . buyers should bear in mind that the unit records ambient sounds e .g . audience and any other background noise so if you want a more pure sound you should record directly to a computer through a mixer or other interface to instruments microphones etc .finally a product that is as simple to use as a point and shoot camera . literally i opened the box put in two batteries the memory card read the quick start guide put the zoom on the included stand and got out my mandolin and started recording . the sound quality is great and you can play it back directly on the zoom by plugging in some head buds included . the control buttons operate like a dvd remote with a menu button using the fast forward and reverse to scroll through entries and the record button as the set .for someone who is not well versed in audio terminology gain sampling rates mics pre post amps levels whatever i just set it to medium gain watched to make sure the lines don t go too far up and was recording away in two steps . push record to test the gain level and push record again red light stays on to record and push record to stop . the file is saved and then you can push play pause to listen back . deleting files is a few extra steps but if you know how to program a vcr you can use this puppy .it is also handy portable and easy to take places . i will take it to record jam sessions music lessons and practice to evaluate my playing and instrument comparisons . the sound quality is great and i could hear how resonant and clear my mandolin is . i wish my playing was as great since it recorded pick noise finger slide noise and other assorted twangs and twings . it records both in wav huge files and mp compressed with various quality levels to choose from . you can easily connect it to a computer windows mac with the included usb cable .the only thing missing is a remote . since you have to push the button on the recorder you have to move to it to activate deactivate it . also picks up noise from your movements . but for the price it s a real gem .i always look for the one thing in a product that is a surprise doesn t cost a lot and delights the customer . on this one it is the included wind sock a tiny foam cap that you can slip on top of the unit to screen the wind for outdoors recording . cool !
these are the only bottles my week old will drink from . its not convinient to constantly breast feed and these bottles are perfect . the nipple on this bottle is so real and is the only one my boy will use . my son did have gas problems but after these bottles the problem fanished ! i find them really easy to clean and i have used these bottles with my now month old twin boys just without the natural nipples the bottom piece is a godsend since i dont have to scrub to get the gunk out of the bottle ! these are truely great bottles and they dont leak either !i use these bottles and avent bottles i have an avent pump and noticed that with the avent bottles my milk had a horrible amount of bubbles . these ones have no bubbles ! which means its probably better feeling for baby ! the size one flow is perfect for my son . he burps as soon as you sit him up this might just be because he is a fast burper ? every baby is different and he has spit up only twice . he is one week old the only problem i have is that i cannot find an adapter that will fit my avent pump and fit these bottles to pump directly into them which makes the avent bottles a little more convenient with breastmilk and playtex doesnt make a hand pump .when i decide to stop pumping i ll definitely give him these bottles exclusively .i was told that avent bottles were the bottles to get and they were the only ones i ever gave to my son . i was very pleased with them right off so i never bothered to try any others . he took the nipple right away and did not have any nipple confusion during the time i was both nursing and giving him a bottle . i have not had any problems with leaking . if the nipple is screwed on correctly not a drop comes out while i shake it to mix up milk or formula . the wide mouth makes the bottles very easy to clean . i just use a bottle brush with warm soapy water then put the bottle nipple and ring in my avent steam sterilizer which i love . i have been using the bottles for seven months now and they are still in great shape .i have a friend who said her baby would not take the avent nipples . since avent bottles are not universal and can t be used with other brands of nipples and rings you may want to keep this in mind before you spend much money on a lot of them .i think that most babies start eating more than ounces during their second month so you probably won t need many of this size . i had seven bottles and that was the perfect amount for us . although my son uses the ounce bottles now i still use some of the ounce bottles to mix and store formula that i add to his cereal .
 later the mic is indeed the behringer c but amazon has provided it with the description belonging to the c u . unlike amazon s description this is not a mic that comes with usb plug phantom power and computer connectivity . and of course none of the advertised included computer software programs is included . it s a conventional studio mic that requires connection to a regular amp p .a . with an xlr jack and phantom power . it will not connect to the usb port of a computer without an expensive adapter and a preamp with phantom power . moreover amazon s form thus far is denying a refund and offering only replacement presumably for another mic just like this one ! if you want the described mic amazon is showing it from a different vendor at about more plus s h . the behringer c mic is the best condenser mic i ve used for the money its large diaphragm capable of reproducing some of the rich and deep sonorities of the costly high end mics at the radio station npr where i occasionally work . however behringer makes a distinction between the c and the c u . the description on amazon fits the c u not the c . so one way or another of the purchasers of this product are likely to be surprised and disappointed .indeed the c u is a phantom powered mic that doesn t require phantom power which it derives from the usb port of a computer . moreover the mic not only saves its owner the bother of a pre amp with phantom power but it also makes unnecessary a costly and time consuming xlr to usb adapter . it s ready to go just plug it into your laptop and start recording . i use sound studio but the included free software audacity works practically as well . on the other hand if the mic is a c as advertised be prepared to receive a conventional condenser mic with an xlr connector and a phantom power requirement found on numerous recording devices and p .a . amps or available on a neat little pre amp sold by amazon the a .r .t . .having just returned a keyboard the m audio pro sx for which amazon mistakenly provided the wrong description for the m audio pro not the pro sx i d be hesitant to place any bets on which mic the buyer will receive the c as advertised or the c u as described . at least if you re purchasing directly from amazon instead of a sub vendor you can be assured of a hassle free return . and if the mistake is due to amazon s description returns are generally postage free .i needed a volt adapter to use with an danelectro n b honey tone mini amp . this was recommended and i am happy with the product .this is a great mixer if you are looking to do simple podcasting or solo music production at home . it s a great little unit . the only set back is that you can not use condenser mics with this without an external phantom power supply as there is no phantom power on this unit . you need to get the model if you need phantom power otherwise this will work fine with regular xlr or hi z microphones .
uniball vision roller ball pen disposable fine . mm point this is a unique pen i simply must review . this in particular is the pen my wife first bought me accidentally instead of getting me my usual pilot pen . this writing instrument is a matter of health for me . so i think you should know about this .the vision is my favorite of all uniball pens containing uniball s special ink . it is slender and these days that makes it tough for me to write with it but i can live with that . the point for some reason reminds me of a fountain pen though it is a rollerball . the ink laydown is smooth and perfect all the time but this pen does bleed like a stuck pig ! its fine . mm point paradoxically offers a much bolder and blacker line than theuni ball jetstream bold point rollerball pens colored ink pens bold point which is a . mm point see my review .uniball is a renowned pen for its special ink called super uni ink or uni ink or a name to that effect which features a non bleeding special ink formula designed to thwart counterfeiters when used for check writing . this is because the uniball ink bonds with the paper the moment it is laid down that means when you write . this ink is long lasting permanent non smearing and non fading so we would technically state the lay down is perfect and . the ink reservoir is generous .when my wife first bought me a uniball pen i was pretty furious . never having used one bearing in mind i m a pilot man all the way when it comes to roller ball pens even though i love across edge capless gel ink pen jet black at . however i keep a medical log . this is no silly diary with entries complaining about phantom heart attacks . my medical diary consists of aide memoires about medications symptoms i have to track and any other problems .it is literally my life on notebook paper even my physicians have come to rely on that medical log during office visits . needless to say the pen i use for that log is vital . the uniball handles even the cheapest of paper as if it were her majesty s triple cream laid paper . it never commits any of the typical gel pen funny business . it does not smear bleed through even one side of the paper to the other nor will it ever fade . in addition this is the type of pen i love to use as a writer author and scientist .note of all the uniballs available be aware of the ones that have the special ink . . .not all models have it such as theuni ball onyx stick fine point roller ball pens black ink pens which is actually adequate but skips too much for my taste .the ones that do contain uniball s special ink besides the deluxe model are uni ball jetstream bold point rollerball pens black ink pens uni ball stick micro point roller ball pens black ink pens uni ball vision elite stick micro point roller ball pens black ink pens . all are available in packs of one dozen in disposable form and most also available in refillable ballpoint style . i advise the purchase of the fine point which is . mm .this is my pen of choice and of necessity for my medical writings . all of my review is the very highest and most sincere recommendation i could possibly make for any product here on amazon . this is a product upon which my very life depends . don t you think you owe it a try ? because i ll guarantee it . . . with my life .this pilot precise v stick rolling ball pens extra fine point pack red ink . . .by pilot pen corp of america is very nice and just what i needed . . . . well done . .pilot g fine point roller ball pens are my pen of choice . i consistently use black blue and red colored penspilot g fine point rolling ball black gel ink pens pack pilot g fine point rolling ball blue gel ink pens pack .likes i like the feel of the pen in my hand . the rubber barrel grip is comfortable and allows me to write for extended periods of time . i like the way the ink rolls off of the pen tip and the ink has a nice look on the paper . there is a sufficient supply of ink to allow a pen to be used for a long time not as long as your basic bic pen but still long enough . i like the retractable pen tip so i don t have to worry about losing pen caps . this pen is affordable ! you can buy replacement ink cartidges so you don t have to toss a pen once its ink runs dry .dislikes though i very much like this pen it s not perfect if you use the pen top draw long lines across a page ink collects at the pen tip and leaves a large blob on the page . if you forget to retract the pen tip and then put the pen in your shirt pocket ink will be wicked out of the pen and leave a large ink stain on your er . . .my shirt this happened to me . the ink will run if it gets wet . it s nice enough that my wife and kids make off with my pens when i m not looking all in all this is an excellent pen but because of a few drawbacks i can t award it stars . even so i still prefer it over other pens i ve used recently .thanks pilot ! any chance of working out the ink blobbing issue ?
portable and easy to use . love the convience and ease of use . only need water and the microwave to kill the germs . very convient and can do bottles at a time or even baby spoons forks even bowls or cups your choice . if it fits inside with lid snapped shut then you can steralize it like me . remember do not force it to close as that will run seal .as some other reviewers have said this item does not stay flat it comes folded in the box and the fold lines were very strong and couldn t be unfolded isn t this not supposed to happen with silicone ? i think this item is a silicone rubber blend which made it hard for the suction cups to stick etc etc . . . between the item not unfolding all the way flat and the unevenness caused by the large suction cups underneath bottom line is that the mat would not stay flat which made it impossible to put a sippy cup on it without the cup falling over and so on . ask me how frustrating this was with a baby who likes to flip everything over anyway to have the items that i expected to stay upright falling over constantly .also other reviewers have noted that this item only sticks to glass tabletops which means that when faced with a tablecloth not only does it not stick but the uncompressed suction cups make a nice uneven rolly playground for all of your baby s utensils foods and liquid to fall over and roll around on nice and messy ! i also want to add that at one restaurant that had fancy wood tables the suction cups had trouble sticking so my husband placed a drop of water underneath each suction cup like they recommend . . . . which worked fine except that the moisture suction blend left marks on the table ! i don t think it was permanent damage but you never know with wood and moisture . . . that s just one more thing you have to be sorry to the restaurant for i bought this one insteadnuk gerber graduates silicone platemat it doesn t have suction cups but it s perfect . it s true silicone and not a silicone rubber blend which means it retains its flat shape no matter what you do to it . and the silicone ness does have a stickiness to it just enough to keep the mat from sliding around . the pic description shows it rolled up but i just fold it into quarters and store it in a quart ziplock baggie in my diaper bag perfect ! it actually ships to you folded anyway . and the edging on it which the tinydiner mat also does not have keeps spills from escaping and dropped food from rolling onto an icky restaurant table . can t say enough good things about the nuk gerber silicone mat .the cup comes with a rubber valve which is the spill proof mechanism . when the valve is on the cup there s no way to suck the water out which defeats the purpose of drinking anything from it . if you take the valve out then the cup is not spill proof . my baby just turns it over and the water comes gushing out . this things is useless . we ended up buying another cup at walmart that works wonderfully totally spill proof no matter what my baby does and easy to suck as well i just don t know the brand of it becuase it s not on the cup itself .
the fender mini electric guitar stand is not made for the fender squire mini guitar . the guitar falls through . i will have to buy a differant stand for him rendering this one useless . the fender stand for standard guitars will not work on the size ether .as a lot of epiphone owners have learned cases designed for the gibson es clones won t fit epiphone guitars as the epiphones have a slightly larger headstock . this case however fits my dot custom like a glove . the padding is perfect the top is arched to precisely fit the guitar and the build quality is better than you might expect at this price level .this cover does not fit a full size acoustic electric hohner guitar . i measured the whole at but this cover does not even come close to fitting ! it measures in diameter so check your guitar closely !
i need this converter v to v for powering a electric cooler koolatron p .i picked this one as it was less pricey like some others ! and the reviews were good .the item works as advertised . of course it gets warm nothing to get excited about . i had a splitter attached to it and powered a electric fan in addition . i noticed only a very small drop in the fan speed once the cooler was attached .i will need another one i am tempted to try the black decker vector cv b travel mate which outputs amps . only amp more am not sure how big the difference would be . it costs more .schumacher sem a . amp speed charge maintainerwell worth the price . . .does exactly what it is suppose to do . update after using this charger less than mos . to maintain my r .v . which is seldom driven i have found that because of the charger failing to cycle back to the charge mode properly the battery that it was hooked to was stone dead . now i ll do some research to find out the annoying process of returning the charger for warranty . update i have contacted the manufacturer schumacher concerning the failure of this charger but after weeks have received no response and it doesn t look like i am going to . so i guess i ll just take the loss of making a bad choice and trash it . btw i am using two chicago electric on board chargers one on my jeep and the other on my mercury sable . both are giving very good service and are less expensive than the schumacher or the battery tender .i love the gripped exterior of the filter . i am getting the same performance as i did with the previous honda filter at a fraction of the price .
i always like to carry extra cable when performing you don t know when one of the one you have breaks and you don t have extras what do you do then it works and it s great to have extra .i have a love hate relationship with compressors . for . you can t go wrong with this one . i use it a lot on my practice rig . if you need a top notch compressor hands down the keeley knob . i use a keeley in my live shows . expensive but worth it . as for this joyo i can t complain . it does it s job pretty good but it does color your tone some what . true bypass is nice it s noticeable in your chain but not to much to take it out . i love for my practice rig . good buy if you re on a budget all us musicians are just don t expect to blown away by it . for give it a shot i did and don t regret it i agree with all the other reviews . these are high quality sounding very comfortable i have a big head too ! durable headphones with a nice long cable and spring reinforced headphone jack . unless you make money with your headphones or have money to burn you probably don t need anything better than the m s . the only thing i would change would be to get rid of the collapsible cans they make the headphones take up less room when folded good for travelling but i m old fashioned and prefer rigid phones they are a bit quicker to get on and off when you don t have to unfold them and flip the cans in the right orientation . no big deal though ! comes with nice screw on to adaptor .
installed on a motorcycle works great . cord included allows for permanent install and can be used for accessories when not charging . great price .solidly built adapter . allows me to plug my trailer into the garage when using the lights charging the batteries or cooling the fridge . a must have for the rver .this adapter works but the clips do not open wide enough to clamp on my battery posts . i was able to attach to the cables coming off the posts albeit barely adhering .
unfortunately i am not able to find this bathtub anywhere my son used to have it years ago . it is great ! it is the only one bathtub where a baby does not slip forward and doesn t go under water . this blue gear is awesome . i do not understand why it is discontinued . i do not care if it is leaking . i did not notice that because it was used in adult bathtub . if somebody has it please i will buy from you .i used this for a short time . it was more of a pain for us .i hated that you had to keep on top of it or you would never know how long it was in there . a timer would have been nice and cheap enough to add .i hated how i had to unplug it and plug it in every time i wanted to use it .yes it may be the best there is out there but that doesn t mean too much . it still has many flaws .now i love avent items but this one they dropped the ball on . there is so much they could have done with this that they didn t . oh well .i really want to get my twins one of these i know they are months already but they still use their exersaucers i rarely use the walker i thought these would be terrific . but i was wondering if you can put one of these on the ceiling or something like does it only have to be in a door way ? my husband wants to put in one large doorway but i feel that would be way to dangerous . does anyone know if you can do that ? has anyone tried ? and is a small month old too old ? i think its great my friend had one for her son about years ago and he loved it . please someone write a review answering atleast some of my questions !update !we bought this jumpster and it has worked wonders ! yes my month old boys still fit though they are scrawny so i wish we got this one earlier . i found that you cant attatch it to the ceiling the top is like a claw and it sort of grabs the molding above a door frame so its easy to put on and move if neccessary . if you don t understand what i mean by claw go to graco .com and find this jumper on their website than it will show you a video clip if you click on the link it will explain . the alasticy string will not snap nor will it come off if installed correctly that is . i can easily pull with all my might and weight and that thing doesnt budge . its very easy to spot clean the seat and very easy to adjust the hieght settings . as to whether you can fit two in a fairly large doorway mine is ft ! the answer is yes and safely ! they are close enough to see eachother but they can not hurt one another . they love bouncing in these things and will for anywhere from minutes to an hour the same as the exersaucer . so i can alternate if they seem kind of tired i put them in the exersaucer to play with the toys or if they are really excited and happy i put them in the jumpster . also if you do not care for the jackpot pattern there are more available on graco .com if your buying online . i did not purchase mine online but at babiesrus i got this pattern and a jungle pattern . i hope this helps everyone !
love the co sleeper . i have twins and both fit in it great . our bed is an average height and the sleeper is still too short to be right next to it though . wish it was just a little taller . the fitted sheet for the bassinet does stain easy but overall great product .i bought it for the playpen which it says it fits . it doesn t . it is a little to big but i managed to make it work . i bought it because i can use it on his crib or it says a twin bed which is would be too small for . it does it s job at keeping the bed clean from wetness which is all i need .it s soft and easy to wear . my daughter like it . if there s newborn size that s will be much better . but small size is suitable too .
the horns were easy to install . they draw about the same amount of current as my stock horns in the . a to a range for each piaa horn so i was able to use the stock wiring relay and fuse instead of having to wire a separate connection to the battery positive . i used installation type b two horns each with a single wire . the stock horn positive connections plugged directly into the positive quick connect of the piaa horns . i didn t have to cut off the stock connectors and crimp on new connectors . the stock horns use a single connection so i ran a separate ground wire from each piaa horn to a ground point near the hood latch .i made an inverted t bracket to hang the two horns off of the location for one of the stock horns . the piaa horns are a bit larger than a typical stock beep beep style japanese horn so you do have to plan ahead to make sure that you have enough room for the horns and whatever mounting bracket you may use . i angled my piaa horns slightly outward instead of hanging straight down to clear an engine brace below the horns .the horns have a nice euro sound and are suitably loud .the rd generation powerprobe includes a number of changes for additional flexibility . in short it is a vehicle powered dvm with both a foot cable and an additional foot extension giving you a foot working range around either the battery terminals or cigarette lighter outlet both clips and a plug are included in the kit .with the series units they use a hard gold plated banana jack to hold the removable probe or cables to extend your reach . if you purchase the accessory kit it includes piercing probes that self center on a conductor pierce the insulation and attach to the jack allowing you to tap a wire at any point to locate intermittant problems .while the dvm is backlit all the time it also has bright white leds facing forward to aid in finding and probing terminals in dark places . the actual probe is hardgold plated with a sharp tip and removable at the banana jack . another identical probe is included with a screw in female banana jack in the accessories kit to retrofit the powerprobe i and ii units to accept external cables and probes .if you need to excite a circuit with a connection to battery ground or to battery positive the switch allows a momentary connection to bridge the probe tip to either voltage which is useful in testing relay driven circuits indicator lights and other small current loads . the prope voltage is always displayed during testing on the meter . the voltage ground switch is circuit breaker protected in case you accidentally drive volts into a chassis ground . additionally since the switch takes abuse it is easily replaced if it fails with just a screwdriver .combined with the testlead set the powerprobe greatly simplifies testing of vehicular wire and big rigs up to a single trailer . the dvm has selectable modes of operation designed for different problems . reading the manual is important to get the full value from this meter .although the price is a little high the design and construction quality are excellent . enough wire is provided to check running lights on trailers or to look for blown fuses . all of the wiring is exceptionally flexible and heavily insulated with top quality connectors . both the tester and accessories come in hard plastic cases that can be stowed in a service box .not mentioned in specifications is that although the probe runs from vdc the meter can be used to measure voltages up to vdc .i cut the horn off the compressor . the horn will fit under the stock cowbell . the compressor was attached under the right side panel to the frame with large zip ties . i ran some hose from home depot to the cowbell and connected it to the stock horn wire . the horn sound goes right between the cylinders and is loud as h ll . many of cell phone scum bags will tell you that my set up works real good .
these are quality labels . easy to print and mine did not smudge when used with both a laser printer and also a deskjet printer . they are the right size to use on either a legal or short envelope x inches .look on the avery site for templates if your word processing application does not have this label size templated .the labels could be a little larger to be more readable on an envelope . . . .hence the four stars . however these do the job and you get more per package .these are quality labels that yield a professional look . they also have a perforated backing paper that bends making them easier to remove from the sheets . if you re looking for a really small no nonsense label that sells with plenty in a pack this product might be for you .however i personally feel they re a little too small for practical use . it s difficult to fit more than three lines of text on this size label and still have it be large enough to read . the typical return address is three to four lines . the largest i can make the common font times new roman is . point in order to fit three lines of text on a label . fitting four lines requires going down to only . . a typical font size is to point . while there s nothing wrong with these labels i prefer using shipping labels as return address labels . using a larger sized label allows users to fit four lines of text a larger font size or even a piece of clip art . while this small size is functional and fuss free and one print yields an impressive labels legibility is sacrificed when labels are this small .these are very high quality file folder labels that can be printed with either an inkjet or a laser printer . i printed mine using a lexmark x inkjet printer . there were no problems with the label sheet feeding through the printer . the labels hold the ink without smearing or blurring or bleeding . furthermore no labels detached from the sheet while moving through the printer a disaster which has happened to me using lower quality labels . yet they are easily peeled from the sheet when it s time to apply them . used over an existing label or writing they are truly opaque . nothing shows through .about half my files are cut manila folders and the other half are cut pendaflex hanging folders . these labels are intended for the cut folders and they work perfectly there . but i found that by restricting the text on the label to about inches total width i could easily use them on the cut hanging folders as well . i just applied the new label to the old paper label insert and then folded over the excess .i recommend that you investigate the design and print online feature available on avery s website . it is far more flexible than a simple template . with it i was able to create a text field for my labels that was short enough to fit on the cut folders . you can select fonts sizes colors styles even add images to your labels . and you can save your layout for future use . the interface is a little strange and sometimes behaves in unexpected ways but you ll easily enough get the hang of it with a bit of experimentation and it has an undo . i printed my first try on plain paper and then overlaid it on the label sheet to double check .the package contains sheets of labels with labels per sheet for a total of labels . searching amazon i find that there is also a label package but i don t see anything smaller than the size . this is fine in a business setting but for home use labels is likely to last more than a lifetime ! i d like to see avery offer a or label version for the home market .these work well and combined with avery s website will get that old file cabinet orderly and organized very quickly .
this issue with this bad boy is not quality features or design . this is a pedaltrain product and just like my pedaltrain this is a well made perfectly designed board that does exactly what it claims it will do it holds freaking pounds of guitar effects stuff . and that my friends is the problem .i am using a voodoo labs x power supply but had to also get a tripplite isobar outlet power strip that i drilled into the upper left corner to handle a couple of the extra pedals . i plug that into the wall and then use a homemade iec power plug in the voodoo . on the pedal i was able to fit jim dunlop volume pedals one is for the looper a crybaby wah tc electronic flashback x sparkbooster mojo mojo overdrive corona chorus hall of fame reverb ditto looper and the shaker vibrato . i also have the mxr flanger helicon harmony pedal for vocals a korg tuner and an electro harmonix pulsar tremolo . i know i know . did i mention this sucker is big ? i feel like they should name it the pedal porch . maybe i can put a few potted plants on it .so getting back to the question of whether or not you should get this behemoth i will ask you to ask yourself do i really need all these pedals ? if the answer is hell yes i deserve them all ! i worked hard for them and can now make awesome sounds ! ! then by all means knock yourself out . just don t get a hernia lugging it around and make sure you book venues with appropriate stage space . no joke .ok so i just installed these things for my krk s no stands . . .just sitting on two other speakers . what can i say ? the bass which previously had disappeared in my studio is now present again ! my monitors sounded kinda thin before because i was losing so much energy to my desk but these things have made a ton of difference ! my stereo image even feels wider now !sure they re a little pricy but hey . . .they work ! if that s what they want to charge for them and people continue to buy them i m cool with that ! i m happy with the reults my got me ! !i hang all my gear up in the studio with these and it s really sturdy . i can t say these are easy to get the guitar down off the wall but that s the point . i ll use a stand if i m going to use a guitar often . i had a lb drummer fall into the wall where i had these baby s hung up and not one fell or almost fell .
highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering suspension work . you will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover .i hate to use the pickle fork . the pickle fork is the last resort for me as it will damage the balljoint boot .i prefer to use the snap on balljoint remover . if that one cannot fit then i will try this tool . if this tool will not fit then i will resort to a pickle fork .i would not buy this product again . it does what it should but if i had to do it again i would just stick with detaling microfiber towels from viking cobra .i hope i never have to use this but if i do i m sure it will perform fine . the hammer point should break glass just fine and the seat belt cutter should work too .
fits my john deere lawn tractor which is model la and likely it fits all the l la and d series lower end john deere tractors . please post a comment if it does not and i ll update this reviewcurrently amazon says it does not fit my third generation miata nc but it doesthese filters come top in most online filter tests and i use them in almost all my carsinexpensive yet works as good as the ones sold by honda dealerships . made true to specs and fits right into the slot on my accord .will buy again .perfect for exhaust work . i bought it for a catalytic converter and o sensor project because it is rated for f to f
love how soft these are and how useful they are for cloth wipes . they clean up well in the wash too ! highly recommended and cannot wait to buy some extras so i have them for my diaper bag .although this product is well represented i don t think i would purchase it again .the concept is good but how do you wash it ? are there covers for it ?i feel like my daughter looks awkward when i put her in this and rarely use it .so i was skeptical thinking that these things wouldn t work ! ! was i wrong ! i put these in the washer and it comes with its own washing bag too and they come out looking perfect ! ! i do not dry them however so i can not vouche for this part of the cleansing process i leave them in the bag and let them air dry which takes a hour at the most ! ! i am a size b with full milk in breast so fairly small boob size and these do not show up under my clothing . a great price for awesome quality ! !
sets under the left side frame rail under the drivers door . ford f . . . if you have the proper filter wrench it s a very fast job .i stuck this mirror onto the wall of my cubicle to keep an eye on spies wondering by . it stuck to the fabric lining and works very well .it is clear and the flip thing works fine . it fit my stock mount on my windshield perfectly . it does come with a mount for you to use just no glue . but as i said it fit my old one with no problems at all .
i purchased this food mill to make food for my five month old baby girl . i will say that it does work very well for some foods but not all . as you can expect it works great with soft foods such as banana and avocado . it does work with other things such as peas broccoli and pears but i found that it still left the food grainy and not smooth enough for my baby who is still eating stage one foods . i had to put those things in the blender to puree them further . i did like that it separated the stings from the sweet potatoes which helped a lot . overall i think it was worth the money . you can even put it in a baggy and take it along . maybe i will use it more once my baby starts stage foods .this is a great food mill . so far i have only used on fruits veg but just love it . when i make dinner for the family it almost always includes a roasted veg of some sort . now i just roast a small portion of the veggies without the salt and toss them in the food mill add a little water and presto ! dinner is ready ! i wouldn t recommend this for a baby who is just starting with solids . this doesn t give you the pureed smooth consistancy of stage baby food in a jar . it s a little more lumpy but still easily eaten by a baby without teeth . it also worked really well on veg that still had a bite to them . they were fork tender but not mushy . this food mill turned them into baby food quickly . will be using this nightly from now on .this is the best product you can buy for your baby . we used it at least once a day to grind up whatever we were eating a super easy just as easy as popping open a baby food jar cheap and nutritious way to feed your baby good quality food that hasn t been pureed water down and cooked to it s nutritional death ! it perfectly grinds up anything you can put in it meat cooked veggies fruit pasta rice you name it ! your child will get used to normal food textures flavors and the transition into non baby food will be much easier . it is incredibly easy to use and clean and makes feeding your baby fresh quality foods very inexpensive . i cannot recommend this product higher !
brother fax personal fax phone and copier a k a the brother fax is a marvel of the fax phone combo and a very fine price for what you get here .since i just received mine all in good order and not at all difficult to set up i have yet to jump for joy upon the receipt of a fax though brother does ask you register your phone fax it to them and they fax a reply . the instructions are clear as day though the book is a scary thickness it is easy to follow instruction at its finest .some reviewers have said this phone does not come with a cartridge already loaded . nonsense . it comes loaded with a cartridge that will allow you about faxes if i recall rightly . you ll need it and need to be prepared with a new cartridge plus your printer paper in order to hook this up and get straight to business .one small concern some might have is the button called hook that button is not a speakerphone which this instrument does not possess . it only takes the phone off the hook as a convenience in fax sending . if you wish to talk to someone you have to use the corded receiver but i love that because this thing is protected against power outages and a good corded phone is de rigueur if your power blows on a regular basis as ours does .i bought this mainly to enable a fax connection between myself and my doctors . mostly i think i will be sending faxes and that is as easy as the push of a button . the rest only requires careful studying of the well written instructions . finally though for me it is a negligible inducement and only as a back up this does a dandy job copying basic black and white documents too .if you want a fax telephone and don t want the hassle of gigantic cost this is the instrument for you . i know it is for me .before ordering this fax machine i did a bit of research well actually a lot because it wasn t so easy to look up the information i needed on the internet or in amazon reviews .first question i asked myself was could i use a fax with my current at t u verse voice ? secondly could i continue to use my phone with an answer machine and two cordless phones without having to use the phone built into the fax machine ? i only wanted a fax for personal use and use occasionally receive and send a maximum of ten pages no color necessary speed of sending and receiving not important cost and efficiency were a must and i would want to use the same phone number for both fax and voice . there was way too many fax machines to choose from and the prices went from low to very high . no where could i find instructions on the internet as to whether or not i could use a fax with my at t u verse voice .through amazon reviews internet tech sites brand names such as hp brother s and so on i searched and still couldn t get any answers . after a great deal of wasted time i finally gave up and called at t u verse voice tech support . the tech assured me i could use a fax with u verse voice . it was very simple i would plug my extension phone to the fax and use the plug from the extension phone to plug into the fax which was already plugged into my u verse gateway allowing both my phone and fax to operate off voip but both phone and fax could not be used simultaneously that is you can t talk on the phone while receiving or sending a fax .after reading amazon reviews and internet reviews for the best fax for me it turned out to be this one brother fax . just to be on the safe side before buying it i read the manual on line from page to page and it appeared this would have every thing i needed .amazon shipped quickly and the installation began . getting my external phone and fax connected was simple . putting the fax together from the box was simple . as for programming the fax now that got a bit complicated but it appears i got it right . all phones have a dial tone . brother allows you to send a test fax registration to them and they will send one back to you . sending my two page fax was slow but easy . when brother sent a fax to me the fax caught the special fax tone just as my answer machine began . it cut the answer machine off about half way through and began printing the fax . the print was sharp better than the ones i ve seen at work .so far i can say this is the perfect fax for me . there is still a few things i need to learn but so far so good . if you have at t u verse voice you can call their tech support if you want . be sure to follow the instructions very carefully . you can use the manual they send you or use the one online which you can download and save . would i recommend this for at t u verse voice ? absolutely ! if things change i will come back and update this comment but hopefully that won t have to be done .maybe i overlooked the information but you can t use just any regular headset or earphones with this unit . you have to purchase the panasonic kx tca headset . the unit does not come with the optional headset and the two models they did this in the instruction guide are discontinued . i purchased this phone particularly for the hands free feature it will be useful if they pointed out that only a specified headset works with the phone .
very useful .this was a gift for a friend who is a fan of the beatles . he was very happy with his gift .as you can tell by the title i ve got another of these little babies . snark improved the readabilty and the new one is bright clear and works great .
schumacher sem a . amp speed charge maintainerwell worth the price . . .does exactly what it is suppose to do . update after using this charger less than mos . to maintain my r .v . which is seldom driven i have found that because of the charger failing to cycle back to the charge mode properly the battery that it was hooked to was stone dead . now i ll do some research to find out the annoying process of returning the charger for warranty . update i have contacted the manufacturer schumacher concerning the failure of this charger but after weeks have received no response and it doesn t look like i am going to . so i guess i ll just take the loss of making a bad choice and trash it . btw i am using two chicago electric on board chargers one on my jeep and the other on my mercury sable . both are giving very good service and are less expensive than the schumacher or the battery tender .i wound up spending or more replacing my vent valve solenoid purge valve and evap canister because i was sold a defective acdelco gt gas cap . i got the dreaded p code and learned the first thing to check is the gas cap . bought the delco brand because of the tassle and hoped that it would be the same as the oem cap . well it s not !after replacing the gas cap and getting the same code a couple weeks later i began to try and troubleshoot the evap system and quickly learned that it is a booger . . .after spending the time and money to replace the above mentioned parts and continuing to get the ses light and monitoring results thru my system code reader i turned my focus back to the gas cap . i had noticed that the tension on the cap before it began to click wasn t even as strong as the old oem cap i had replaced . at my wits end i decided to go ahead and purchase the stant brand gas cap and give it a shot . i read some good reviews about stant . the new cap arrived and the tension and fit on it was times better than this cap . after replacing with the stant cap i monitored the cars system and it passed the evap check . at that time i felt relieved that i found my problem but i was also peeved that i had spent on other parts because of this defective cap . so i would advise anybody out there to buy a stant instead . . . . . oh and the delco is made in germanyplews lub hand pump . works just fine to refill dual pump fluid in my honda crv . must for service every miles .
i love the halo sleep sacks because they re safe they allow my son to move around and they keep him warm . we used the sleep sack swaddle from day and now that he s rolling over we don t swaddle him with arms in . i bought this one so we could have one without the velcro straps for the swaddle and i like that it s cotton so we will be able to use it in the summer without him getting overheated .love this sleepsack ! it keeps my baby warm all night long without the hassle of having his blanket being kicked off and getting tangled . my son is a wiggle worm and does somersaults in his sleep and this is the perfect blanket for him ! love it ! highly recommended .my daughter is now weeks and we have been using the sleepsack for probably a month or so . my husband and i were swaddling our daughter with a blanket but she was getting her hands out and sometimes kicking her feet out . the sleepsack is great because it zips to make sure the feet stay in and you have the option of swaddling with arms in or out . our daughter liked being swaddled and slept better in the sleepsack so i would absolutely recommend it .
love k n wrench off filters . my gm . l v has a hard to reach oil filter . on the first oil change on this truck i had to remove the nipple which attached the oil filter to the engine block in order to remove the old oil filter which became stuck to the engine block and was destroyed in an attempt to remove it . k n are just so simple to remove . i only use k n oil filters because of similar problems with other cars .this item is primarily used for removal not installation of an oil filter that has been tightened too much to remove by hand . the half circles of metal grip the canister of the oil filter and they dig into that sheet metal to prevent slipping when you apply pressure to your wrench handle and start to turn . the tool may need to dig in enough to dent the oil filter canister depending on the degree of excessive tightening by a previous installer . each half circle on the tool is brought to initial grip and held there by a set of springs on a sliding mount to accommodate a variety of filter canister sizes . i used it to remove the original factory oil filter for the first oil change on a new vehicle . i probably won t have to use it ever again . in years of diy oil changes across a couple dozen different cars i ve never had a leak by simply hand tightening the canister to the mount .this is one the best oil filters on the market for the harley davidson motorcycles . i use these filters on my harley davidson fatboy motorcycle because they do a great job in filtering my oil . the oil filter on my harley is mounted on the front of the engine . this location plus the fact the crank position sensor is in the way of using most oil filter wrenches you have to buy a special wrench which will slip in use to remove the oil filter . this oil filter has a mm nut welded on end of the filter housing this makes installing or removing the oil filter very easy . you don t have to worry about damaging your engine crank position sensor which are expensive to replace . i highly recommend this great k n performance oil filter for any harley davidson motorcycle owner who uses regular or synthetic motor oil . great price and it s chrome plated to boot .
i bought the medium already reviewed it with details and it works awesome . this one is smaller in length tho i have read diameter is the same . i searched these reviews trying to see if it would work somehow in my gallon bio cube with some modification . i m still looking into that . the bio cube brand protein skimmer is useless . this one for my standard tank is perfect . well as i was looking through reviews for the term bio cube and i read a review that was confusing for me . f . jones on july th said he chose the hang on back option . he obviously had it outside of his tank . this is not made to hang on the back outside of the tank . it would definitely fall apart anyway as it wasn t designed for that . it s made to go inside the tank . . .on the back yes but in the water . the other option is in a sump perhaps that was his confusion . that said months with my medium i m trying to find a way to integrate this design in my biocube . for the low price i may buy it anyway and see if there is a way i can modify it to fit . thank you to the reviews that gave me hook up advice . i ll add my version of what advice helped me mixed with my own experience for any new perspective buyers what you need you should get a dual port pump smaller pumps aren t strong enough . i tried a smaller single port for a few days as my air pump didn t arrive when my skimmer did and it wasn t very efficient . once my dual port whisper arrived boom ! ! ! great skimming for months now on same stone even . . . so get a good strong pump is most important for success . also a small plastic air tube control valve is helpful in each line to start the air correctly unless your air pump has individual controls for each port but not a necessity if you just unhook the line from the pump that you put air into second . then after upflow is going hook it up . but then i used a valve on upflow too to turn it down some so one on each side is helpful and they are cheap in the multi pack . you will need tubing of course . instructions there was a taped note on the upflow tube telling you your re supposed to start air to that tube first as two air tubes come out of the top of it . idiot proof i would say . do this and the flow works fine . also tells you where the water line should be on the box if i recall . again for that one poor soul that had it literally on the back of his tank outside . . . options are on back of your tank inside your aquarium or other choice probably best if possible is placement in a sump if you use one . quality it s made out of flimzy plastic yes handle with care during installation . after instelation tho removing and replacing the cup has been uneventful and easy . the removable cup for leaning stands well above waterline and above my flat hood so it had easy access . there are some bubbles that escapes the big column tube prior to the cup where the air tube comes out but those few bubbles doesn t affect it s function . initially i found it curious . it is a minor design distraction so don t stress if you see that it hasn t affected the skimming at all . condition mine arrived in fine working condition . but if it comes broke just send back for replacement . once you get the right one for those few cases that recieved broken parts you will not regret replacing with an operational one . this thing skims with a lot do might daily !these were details for the newer tank hobbiest that are confused about the set up . . . i hope it helps solve any more confusions .this squirrel baffle is just about as cheap as they come here on amazon . the best and cheapest ones can be found either at a local tractor supply company or at the tractor supply website . its not quite as big or effective as either a squirrel deterrent or protection from the weather as a dome style but it is certainly far better than nothing . and a whole lot cheaper . the problem with the basic design of this baffle is the swing away system it employs . the same ineffective system that is unfortunately employed in a lot of squirrel baffles . even ones a lot more expensive than this one . the theory behind it is that the squirrel will lay down its paw on top of it with its full weight slip off and then fall to the ground as the baffle swings out of the way . unfortunately this is one of those times when something sounds most logical in theory but is a total bust in actual practice . squirrels very quickly figure out the baffles rational and set out to defeat it . that is to say they just come to learn to hang their feet from above and use the baffles swing away design to their advantage by it moving freely out of their way . just about everyone that has a bird feeder then sees the usual result . a squirrel hanging down from above upside down feasting on and spilling your expensive seed .this baffle can be made far more effective by a simple redesign . just unscrew the two hooks that merge in the middle of the dome from above and underneath and screw in a lock nut so it is flush with the baffle on top and below . then screw the hooks back in . the swing away design is then defeated and the baffle will remain stiff and very hard for the squirrel to move out of the way with his body due to the counterweight of the feeder underneath . also installing the nut stiffens the baffle sufficiently enough to prevent it from being tossed around by the wind as some other reviewers have mentioned . trust me it is very simple to do and it makes this very reasonably priced baffle most effective indeed . i recommend this baffle if you re on a budget and desire something that works very well with the simple modification described above . order several at once to make the shipping charge worth it . . .works great perfect replacement . just remember that this won t hook directly into your faucet and you will need the brass upgrade or original adapter to make the two go together .
the greatest surprise we found when we got it was how twistable it was . i thought it was going to be just forming an but it has so many different shapes then i find myself playing with it while my daughter plays with something else . it is very entertaining even for older kids .my month old daughter likes it very much . it grew with her . we bought it when she was month old and just liked to suck it now she bangs it on the floor or the table . it is resistent noisy enught and the rubber part is nice .we mostly use these in the bath my son is months now but we have had them since he was born . when he was first born we just used them as a cup for washing but now he grabs all of them and bash them together and splash water everywhere and tries to drink out of them . they are fun out of the bath too though ! love them !i started out my son with elimination communication ec aka early start potty training of which amazon carries great books by different offers on the subject when he was wks old . we kept it up until he was months old and then i stopped because my mother in law thought it was weird i tried to start again when he was months but he was already attached to his diapers . i could really kick myself now that he s and many many poop diapers later ! anyhow we had the smaller version of the baby bjorn potty when we were doing ec and it worked great cuz we could manuver him and pee him sitting down . the pee gaurd is in the opinion of more than just our family terrible for toddlers ! after he bumped it sitting down i couldn t get him near the potty for weeks . i am not usually into frills and over the top plastic toys but i love the fisher price potty we got him instead . i didn t put batteries in it too much for me . i love it . my son actually uses it . it has a removable splash gaurd . our boy pees standing up anyhow just like papa ! it looks more like a grown up potty except it has a cartoon smiley face . i thought the smiley face silly at first but since it makes my son like it more it kinda makes me happy now . and the potty seat removes so you can put it on your toiletseat for easing toddlers nerves when moving onto to toilet training . not as simple looking as the baby bjorn but a much better potty in many many ways .
i uses this on a workshop door that has a fairly aggressive automatic door closer . the stop holds the door firmly open .when in the kicked up position the stop holds in place and doesn t have a tendency to drop down .i use this to prop open my heavy office door which is on an automatic closing system that closes and locks the door soon as you release it .the national hardware wedge is long and sturdy enough to hold this type of door open however it lacks enough rigidity to truly do the job . you tend to want to kick it into the door so it wedges into the opening at the bottom but this particular door stop isn t strong enough to be used that way it flexes and bends rather than sliding further under the door . because of this eventually the weight of the door wins and it gradually closes pushing the door stop out of the way .also unlike the product description which says gray the unit i received is dark brown .i suppose it s a fair product for the price but if you have a large heavy door or maybe one on a spring loaded door closer you ll want something more .my parents have had an older model of this key box at their house for more than ten years so i knew that i d be getting a good durable lockbox . i wanted to store two keys to my house in a safe place in case i ever left the keys inside when i locked my door . there s no better way to store a key this handily beats leaving a key in the open in a decorative frog under a rug etc .this key box is made of flame resistant solid heavy metal both the cover and the base . the buttons and lock unlock mechanism are made with high quality metal and plastic and setting the combination is as easy as popping off a cover on the inside and using a small screwdriver jeweler eyeglass flathead to turn some adjustment screws then replacing the cover . the cover can t be removed without the combination once locked at least not without explosives !it comes with three long wood screws to mount it to any surface along with some anchors . i located a stud behind drywall and got all three screws in solid wood . this thing s not going to move unless the house comes down . a tip for opening using the key box press in the combination then when you re going to pull down the release latch keep holding it down while you use the key to unlock your door . then while still holding down the latch put the bottom back in and push it shut and finally release the latch so it locks again . this way you avoid having to enter the combination twice .
this cover does not fit a full size acoustic electric hohner guitar . i measured the whole at but this cover does not even come close to fitting ! it measures in diameter so check your guitar closely !does not work for all guitars . one of my guitars has a more rounded head and it does not fit over that anyway i have tried . though with the arrow shaped holders it works as it shouldthis hanger is very well padded and the padding can be adjusted to custom fit your guitar . it holds the guitar perfectly spaced from the wall .
love how soft these are and how useful they are for cloth wipes . they clean up well in the wash too ! highly recommended and cannot wait to buy some extras so i have them for my diaper bag .i do not like these bags . the twist tie closure system is cumbersome . the bags are small . the plastic is thin and leaks in the freezer when frozen . the only advantage i can see to these bags is that they are easy to hook to the medella breast pump and pump into directly .playtex cups are the best ones on the market . everything they make is interchangeable which is very budget friendly . the valves tend to accidentally go into the garbage disposal or disappear in the dishwasher because they are clear . the replacement package is essential but are not easy to find in stores .
sizes listed in reviews and the two in the description . x . x and . x . x don t match to what i received . . .the bag i received is in between what has been listed in the descriptions . x x empty .while seemingly a good quality bag with a fair amount of straps and attached rain cover hidden in the heel of the bag it seems the manufacturer or seller has no idea how to use a measuring tape !the bag itself is quite nice . . . good padding rubberized bottom to prevent sliding small pockets on either side and zippers seem of reasonable quality .for the price and bag quality i m not complaining . it works great on my cb and it does fit on the pillion of my vt c without having to remove my rider backrest so if you have standard seating or a touring adventure style this bag will do well for you as a pillion bag and with a little strap adjustments it also fits vertical on the front or back of a sissy bar or horizontal on a larger luggage rack . . .would recommend getting a size smaller than what the sizing chart recommends as i measure aroun my leg as recommended and the chaps were one size too large . . otherwise they are awesome quality and buildthe x inch mirrors are a good fit for honda pilot . i had to order via amazon since i couldn t find these anywhere it appears local auto stores only carry the x inch size . these little blind spot mirrors are a must buy item they cover the blind spots on either side of the vehicle very well .
just a basic female xlr to inch male adapter . i use these so i can plug my regular mic cables into my keyboard practice all in one pa .i primarily use this as an usb adapter for my headphones so that i can connect convert the . mm headphone jack into my pc .the audio adapter is well built . it has a yellow led light that is solid when plugged into an usb port and blinks when there is a device that is connected to it through a . mm jack .installation was flawless . windows bit installed drivers immediately .no issues . no nonsense . simply works !as with all boss roland products the boss fs performs as designed . i purchased it to control both my boss me multi effects pedal and my fender blues jr amp . the a switch in non latching mode allows me to cycle through stored effects banks in my me and the b switch in latching mode allows me engage and disengage the fat overdrive switch on my blues jr amp . everything works exactly as planned . the fs rugged compact fits right into my into me carrying case and easy to use .i read a few reviews where people were complaining about batteries . . .something to complain about . as with most guitar players i don t use batteries in my effects pedals i use an volt ac dc adapter . visual sound offers the one spot ac dc adapter kit that has a volt battery snap connector adapter . i removed the battery cover then using a small rat tail file i carefully cut a notch in the battery cover for the snap connector to pass through . i then put rubber feet purchased at ace hardware on the bottom to allow the snap connector cable . . .battery problem solved .i also use the fs as a sustain pedal for my yamaha ypg portable grand piano and a control for my rc loop station simultaneously . the possibilities are limited only to your imagination . it is somewhat expensive but it is a great product ! ! if you need a duel switch then i highly recommend purchasing the fs .
this is like the icing on the cake for finishing the plates . i see a lot of nice cars with ugly dealer plate frames and rusted bolts . . . .why why why ? ? just remove the frame get these caps and hide the ugly screws . make sure your screw heads are not the hex head as it will not fit inside the caps . smaller phillips head machine and tapping screws will fit no problem .these cruiser accessories locking fasteners import stainless are exactly what i needed to mount my plate securely to my truck . though i ordered them for my car it had no plate mount to use them on and i couldn t get up behind the plastic bumper to back up the screws with the locking nuts . nuts !i should have gotten the honda cap . this fits ok but the screws are not captured in the cap . with the original cap the screws cannot fall out . considering the position of the screws when mounting this captured screws are an advantage .
the westcott titanium bonded trimmer with scoring and cutting blades is well made and works efficiently on regular paper cardstock and laminated cardstock paper . very little pressure is needed to create a clean edge as long as the blade is sharp . the grid system ruler bars and swing out ruler make lining up the paper easy . finding the right position for cutting can be a bit tricky at first but once you get use to the location needed for precise cuts it works nicely . i find that cutting multiple sheets of paper can lead to slightly differentt cuts on each sheet due to shifting so this unit is best suited for single sheets in my opinion . the blades are easy to change out once you get used to the method of removal . the scoring blade works nicely on both regular sheets as well as cardstock . overall it s a good unit for the price depending on your needs .this wescott paper trimmer lets you easily cut or score paper . the cutting feature can handle up to pieces of normal printer paper with ease . my wife uses this and a fiskars cutter and she prefers the fiskars because its cutter runs through a trench cut into an overlay and that makes it easy to see exactly where the cut is happening . the problem with the wescott is that there is a bit more guesswork as to where your actual cut will occur . you can get it to within a mm or two but beyond that you aren t sure . with the overlay feature on the fiskars you know precisely where the cut will be and can cut apart tiled printouts with ease .the scoring feature doesn t do much on regular printer paper but it works great on card stock . when you run the score across your card stock you ll get a perfect crease that will fold with ease .this would be a star product if it was just a hair easier to line up the cutting line . despite this minor complaint this is still a very good cutter and the scoring feature could be very handy for making sharp folds in card stock .this is wide ruled paper and is easier for grades to form their words on .there are sheets of paper in a pack with drilled holes and fit perfectly in a inch binder .
i ve seen the reviews questioning the capacity of this cord so i m wondering if maybe there are changes in the cord . the one i received is marked on the back of the package gauge wire amp capacity now i m not an electrician nor do i pretend to be one . i don t know that g wire is sufficient to carry a . i ll be using this for a small gps that i mounted up high and i don t want the cord in the windshield .glad i went with the chrome and not the black one i hooked this one up to my gv motorcycle if you have just a little know how you can do it your self all you will need to go with this is a relay that does not come with it . you can get it on here or any part store i have made many people jump due to the sound of the horns loudness .i purchased this for my avalanche to use while i am towing my foot camper . prior to having these all i could see behind me was my camper now i can see any car that is behind me it s a must have for anyone pulling a trailer that is difficult to see behind and is much better and more stock looking than the other mirror options out there .
this printer is the biggest ink hog i have ever seen . it wastes all of the ink colors even if you are only printing black text . it cannot be made to print black text if it is out of ink in any of its colors . it pumps its ink out in a ritual cleaning process that you cannot limit . my favorite problem is that it has trouble grabbing a sheet of paper from the hopper . the message is media out or not loaded correctly will be displayed and there is no fix for it . i can have fresh paper in it and after printing several sheets in secession it will miss feed and after several miss feeds it will get back to printing . we need a lemon law for this printer .when my old expensive fax machine failed in i was forced to look for a replacement . the many choices were mind boggling but the brother mfc n caught my eye for several reasons . it was selling then for less than . . . after rebate the page replacement toner cartridges sell at retail for less than . . . less than per page and this machine has additional features that i could not have imagined when i bought my previous fax machine more than ten years prior .now after nearly three years this machine has proven its reliability is selling for nearly . . . less and there are third party sources for toner cartridges that charge less than . . . for them further lowering the cost per printed sheet . based upon my positive experience with this machine i recommended it to a friend who ordered it from amazon . i installed it for him in may of and noted that the software has been upgraded and the network installation is now much easier than it was in .aside from being able to scan a page fax in about a minute and then transmit the pages automatically from its memory the brother mfc n has a built in cat network interface enabling it to serve as a network laser printer . any user on the network can send a fax directly through this machine without printing it first . this machine also performs well as a digital ppm auto feed photocopy machine . the machine s automatic document feeder which holds about pages also works with its scanner enabling anyone on the network to scan multiple page documents into any application that supports scanning . i use it to automatically scan pages into adobe acrobat which is much more convenient than hand feeding the pages into my flat bed scanner . the included software package will also perform ocr optical character recognition and translate printed documents into text that can be edited .in addition to its automatic document feeder this machine also has a flat platen to scan copy or fax bound or bulky documents . this multi function machine s built in website enables the network administrator to set up speed dial and one touch dialing from a computer monitor the status of the machine s consumables and obtain other statistics .after using this machine since here are the things that i like about it . this machine has the lowest price that i ve found for a machine with so many features is simple to set up is reliable and has never needed any repairs . . scanning a multi page fax is fast and dependable and it automatically sends documents at the fastest speed possible to other fax machines from memory trying again if the receiving machine s line is busy or doesn t answer . . from a cold start this machine can print or copy faster than other machines and its fax print and copy image quality is excellent . . the cost of consumables is reasonable dramatically less than ink jet and lower now than they were in . . this multi function machine is surprisingly compact lightweight and takes up much less space than a separate scanner copier network printer and fax machine would require . fax pages come out face down in the same order as they were received so you don t need to reshuffle the pages into the right order . . using the cheapest standard lb photocopy paper available i ve rarely had paper jams or problems with the automatic document feeder . . the machine can be programmed to automatically reset its internal clock in the spring and fall for daylight savings time . a free firmware upgrade is now available for download that installs the new changeover dates . . built in memory can store hundreds of fax pages .things not to like . the paper tray holds only a half ream of paper . . scan quality is adequate but not good enough for critical work . for serious graphics work you would need to use a dedicated scanner . . if you depend upon this machine or any other multi function machine for all of its capabilities you ll lose them all when it needs repair or replacement .in summary the brother mfc n takes up less space and costs less than buying a separate printer scanner fax machine and copier . it also costs less than other laser multi function machines . yet it does all of those jobs capably and quickly . this makes the brother mfc n ideal for someone with a tight budget and a small office or home application where all of those features would be useful .when i bought this machine it was selling for less than half the current posted price . at the current price shown more than it doesn t represent the very good value that it did a year ago .i bought this as a replacement for my old photosmart p printer which was good but didn t have a fax machine . the office jet does and the price was right so i got it .this is a straightforward multifunction in office machine . what s good about a in is that it does things in one ! the has a fax machine with built in . kbps modem a color scanner copier and printer . the fax machine has an auto document feeder which is nice for sending multiple pages . up front is a panel for the various functions scanning faxing and copying . there s an alphanumeric pad for faxing and a backlit lcd dot matrix display . you can hook this printer up to a home network . there are slots for memory cards also . there s an ethernet cable port in back so it s network compatible . i have mine hooked up to my home wireless network through a router and it works fine .hp says this will do pages per minute black and white and color . obviously it s an exaggeration because it depends on the print quality . a fast draft print will come close but for anything else forget it . i d get good color prints in over a minute on the maximum dpi . it uses print cartridges quickly also . i burned through a color and a back and white in a couple months of light use less than pages . hp cartridges are expensive and rarely go on sale .this does print great photos although not as good as a dedicated photo printer like the photosmart series . the canon pixima in series machines do the best job but were a lot more expensive . black and white text comes out clean and sharp but not as sharp as a laser machine . the scans come out good but expect to wait for them . same with copies . scanning and copying are both painfyully slow with the . other machines do much better and the higher end hp in s perform all these tasks quickly .overall this is a good machine for light use or occasional use . it would be best for someone who needs to send an occasional fax scan or copy something . it does everything i ask it to and does it good enough .pros low pricehp qualityreadily available ink cartridgesquick printinggood print qualitynetwork readymulti card

despite being so small it will fill most rooms completely ! these are lasers ! you can buy one of those cheapo keychain sized lasers and those go for miles so you know this thing will deliver . the patterns they go in are mesmerizing no matter the pace . i haven t tested the sound feature but i ve seen it on videos . i recommend this to anyone want to be entertained !these cables are great in microphone or di box applications . they are clean of any electrical noise . having color coded cables are also good too .i mix and master all my own music on these guys . before the audiophiles try to stone me to death listen ! i cant have giant krk monitors blasting in my small apartment but what i can have is a solid pair of affordable headphones that present my music in a very true light . these are not beats by dre they will not make all your songs have super bass and they aren t a great fashion statement however they are work horses and will show you how your music really sounds . nicer headphones exist true but these are the best in their price range in my opinion .
i purchased this diaper pail after struggling for several months with the diaper genie . the diaper champ was hands down the best diaper pail i used while my child was in diapers i used three diaper genie easy saver diaper pail and the diaper champ . i didn t have to spend loads of money on the special diaper genie bags anymore it had far superior odor control as compared to the easy saver diaper pail and it s really easy to use drop a diaper in flip the handle over done ! i actually developed pain in my elbow from all the twisting the diaper genie required as it wrapped each diaper into its little sausage like casing . i passed this diaper pail on to a friend once i was finished with it and will happily purchase it for other friends in the future .i love this diaper bag because of all of the compartments . within the main compartment there are two pockets to hold diapers bibs clothes or wipes at least that s what we use it for and the outside has multiple pocket possibilities as well . we can carry just about everything we need or could want to have with us when we go out with our little one . i like to be prepared so we have usually have in the bag diapers a container of wipes a bib or two infant tylenol mylicon a change of clothes a bottle formula in a small dispenser baby food a spoon or two insurance cards a booklet from the pediatrician immunization records my wallet chapstick and cell phone . my husband teases that ew could go camping with what i carry in my purse but i always have whatever it is that he needs . . . i also really like the zippered bag included for dirty wet clothes nothing else get contaminated and it s easy to wipe out . the padded changing mat with zippered pockets is great too . i keep diaper cream in one of the pockets they unfold so baby doesn t lay on them when being changed .we like it that this diaper pail uses regular garbage bags instead of specialty diaper pail inserts liners . the mechanism works well to dispose of the diapers and attempt to keep the smell isolated but at a certain level of the room usually nose height when you re sitting on the floor you can still smell poo . it works well to bundle the diapers into compact little bundles and use the velcro to seal the bundles before you put it in the diaper hole . overall we are very satisfied .
while the product came as described the build quality felt a little lacking . on the website it mentioned that it accepts the shure ksm threading but it does not so if you re threading matches the ksm look elsewhere .i love the snark tuners and i own several different models . they all work great and of the various models i prefer the sn red . i got the white one because i just liked that it was a unique amazon only model . the sn display is like the display on the sn and offers lower resolution than the sn sn sn displays . still it works beautifully and the glossy white looks nice clipped on my pearl white apx . its also easy to find should you drop it in the dark .i recently ordered this ukulele and others while researching products for my senior adult choir at church as i wanted to give them a few options .okina uk soprano ukulele with rosewood fingerboard naturaldiamond head du ukulele naturalmahalo u or painted economy soprano ukulele orange lanikai lu soprano ukulelekala ka s mahogany soprano ukulelethe okina diamond head and mahalo were all under at the time and within price of each other . of the three i thought that the mahalo was the best offering both visually and in terms of tone quality . the okina had a poor sound quality even compared to my own and year old ukuleles which had the original strings . a string upgrade to aquila strings helped significantly but even then the okina still had a far worse sound quality at this price level .the diamond head and mahalo both sounded better even with the stock strings and each includes a very nice for this price little gig bag . incidentally what the mahalo product description says is a color matching brown gigbag ended up being black but black is pretty standard gig bag color . the mahalo has the most island look to my eyes and the best sound . much of the sound can probably be attributed to the strings which are more substantial than the diamond head s . that being said it still makes financial and practical sense to get the mahalo since it s so near the same price compared to the diamond head and has better strings already installed . i ve also reviewed the lanikai and kala on their own pages .
while this hanger is not unattractive and is well built i could and will modify it to better suit my needs . the design of the hanger causes the neck of the uke to stand off of the wall inches at the head and inches at the hanger itself and inches at the base of the body . this is not an easy fix but it is doable .like many here the case could be an inch bigger . for my ibanez i cut the bottom material along the edge against the side wall enough to take out the bottom foam and then put the material back . now mine closes without pressure on the bridge .and works well for it . my only concern is that the shaft that holds the weight is plastic and not metal . i don t know how long it will last . i might find a tube to place over it and make a lager hole . but the price is right and the stand is solid enough . all areas that touch the banjo or guitar are protected and should last .
i bought this item as a new fish tank owner not knowing what i would need and this item helped me get the right balance for my fish tank .all my fishes love this food . i have a gallon tank with comet goldfish red platy and electric green glo fish .i bought this to use on my gallon breeder tank . it is very handy and informative . i recommend for fish tank owners
this keeps all of the sticky stuff off of my leather seats and thats exactly what i wanted it to do . it has also kept those deep indents that car seats leave behind off of my seats . the plastic is thick enough to protect the seat but does not get in the way of the car seats installation .i didnt know you had to lift the seat up to use this . there is a rubber thing inthe back that stops you from placing it on the seat itself you need to lift up the seat and place it on the dirty part of the rim . . . .all b c of that stupid rubber thing in the back . i evem tried cutting it off but it still doesnt help . this was a poor design .i like the squishiness of the seat but after my son has been sitting there a while min . the rigid plastic base still cuts a ridge into his legs the seat squishes all the way down . i think once he gets more efficient at using the seat this will improve . the urine guard at the front is also a separate piece just tucked in between the seat and the base so when my son climbs on he sometimes knocks it out of place doesn t guard well then . i do like that it s a bendable rubber type material so it has some give when he scooches his behind over it . my dad had to fashion a filler block out of styrofoam attached with packing tape to the back of the seat because our toilet is oval so this potty seat slides back when my son sits down . the description said it works with round and oval seats . this is true it does fit but slides to the back of the toilet opening so my son s feet don t reach the stool and he gets scared . with the seat braced to the front it s fine . great colorful graphics !
i love how this is a universal fit to all of aquaclear powerheads . i just wish it came in different lengths because this item might be too long for smaller tanks . the only other improvement i could see making is to have separate chambers inside for some biological filtration to be added to the mechanical cleaning pad .i dangle this heater mat from the center of my roach enclosure . it works well . i actually run this plus another small great choice brand heater in the enclosure . the room the roach enclosure is in averages about of and the roach enclosure with this and the other one stays about of .works well in conjunction with a fx canister other fluval media . keeps my g w large mixed cichlid stock crystal clear .
i bought these classic erasers from amazon when a special price was offered . the erasers now reside at the learning center that employs this potato head . the pink pearl erasers come in handy there since the erasers on the ends of pencils are short lived . i like that these papermate erasers have wedged ends that help with fine control .others tell me that the erasers work smoothly with no smudging and no pink residue left behind . of course some eraser dust stays behind but that can easily be brushed aside with a sweep of the hand .amazingly these exotic made in malaysia erasers have a faint rubber smell . i used the erasers a few times myself so that i could have firsthand experience with them . since i seldom make mistakes myself most of my experience with these fine erasers is necessarily vicarious .stop using those cheap red erasers . put down those pencil erasers down . use this staedtler eraser . now !i can confirm and agree with other reviewers and countless people who haven t reviewed this that this eraser is indeed one of the best .the eraser has a smooth feel and consistency when erasing . it s not rough and does not destroy the surface that is being erased . for the most part it can handle any erasing job .immensely useful for drawers artists students teachers everyone . anyone can benefit from this phenomenal eraser .the need to constantly sharpen the eraser tip has been dealt with by the paper mate tuff stuff eraser stick designers saving time and eliminating distractions .
great product for getting animal smells out of fabric and carpet . doesn t necessarily prevent your pet from using the same spot again but it does get rid of the odor without smelling all flowery or perfumey .this along with a medium large scat mat definitely eliminates critter on furniture problems ! and it s clear so it doesn t ruin the appearance of the furniture . we ll remove them once our pets get the hint . i have used this product for many years to treat pet stains from accidents . it has always done a superb job of removing the stain and odor . if used properly the animals are not attracted to the same location to make another mess . i highly recommend this product .
this product has a great womb sound very clear without obvious loops in the sound . only wish it had white noise option as well . . . . . .i love that you can mix and match sounds with this sound soother my girls like the womb sounds particularly . however this thing is not even close to being loud enough to qualify as white noise . you have to put the thing directly into an infant s crib making the cord a choking hazard in order for them to even hear it . if you are like me and need the white noise to keep your baby from waking up from other sounds in the house you need something a lot louder .we received this product and our little one really likes all the colors and the squeaking noise but i m not sure where the crinkle part comes from because our product must be defective . there isn t any crinkle but we can live without .
this works perfectly with my aquarium exact temperature is displayed and also a convenient green zone marked to know the temperature for tropical fish .this is not hot enough for a uromastyx . it advertises as heat and ub light but then the instructions say you may need an additional heat source . even with additional heat not hot enough for a gallon for a uromastyx .while i am sure this would make a great under tank heater for any reptile i am using it for temperature control while fermenting homebrew beer .i purchased the medium sized pad and it is working like a champ in my freezer that has a seperate controller for cooling . i use this along with thehydrofarm mtprtc digital thermostat for heat matsto keep the temperature from going too high and causing the freezer to cycle on when the ambient temp is low enough to avoid the need for cooling .last night it was f in my garage . the controller for the mat was set for f . the mat kept everything between all night i have a seperate fridge thermometer that records high low . the mat seems to heat up quickly and provides a constant even heat . recommend for homebrewing .
it s nice for my son to be able to stand his five string bass up in his room on display while still having it be kept safe . it helps him remember to practice when he sees it .i have run sound for several large churches providing services for both live sound and television broadcasting . the way that you have to mix for each of those is vastly different especially when applying vocal effects . i have also run a small recording studio for the last years .the rule says that if you can get of the sound you re looking for with of the work be satisfied . this mic mechanic mm is more like of the sound with of the work .i actually use this more in a studio setting than for live sound . primarily because it solves so many problems that you face as a sound engineer . adaptive tone . the mm continuously listens to your voice and adjusts the compression gate eq and de essing . even when recording dry vocals at a minimum you should at least set your compression then in post production add parametric eq to place your vocals where they need to be set .now ? i hit the tone button and all that is done for me . it makes a dynamic mic sound great ! it makes working with a condenser mic easier . reverb . most home recording enthusiasts have problems applying reverb . they either use too much or too little . with this when you it equally between wet and dry you get the right amount of reverb to bring recording to life . i recorded a vocal with club room and hall reverb . each one sat just right ! when you solo the vocals you can tell which is used . in the mix it was more subtle . good job ! pitch correction . i have to admit my own vocals aren t perfect . when you record your own vocals and you re like me you ll hear a chorus sound in your headphones . that s because you re hearing you own vocals and the pitch correction through the headphones . this takes a second to get use to .when set in the center you can still do your vocal gymnastics slide into notes and it seems . . . natural . it pulls you to the closest not in the chromatic scale so if you re way off it will make your vocals sound out .i m not a singer but this has renewed my joy in singing !this is an awesome way to get into the in ear monitor game without dropping hundreds of dollars . adjust your volume of the main mix and adjust your instrument mic level relative to the mix without affecting the main sound or your band mates feeds . perfect for that singer or musician who is constantly asking for more me in their monitor . you can also use this to control a floor monitor if you want .
i hooked this up to the output of my mackie mixing desk . i have my powered monitors via a y cable on one output and my headphones on another .i can now play my guitar write record etc through the speakers or the headphones and very quickly switch between them without messing about with cables and whatnot .because my headphones are closed dj type they cut out a lot of background noise and i previously found myself wondering are the speakers off ? . it was particularly awkward in that the power switches for my speakers is on the back . not handy !now i ve installed this headphone amp it s definitely become an integral part of my setup and definitely worth the money . now i can actually get on with the music another excellent behringer purchase . recommended without hesitation .the us works fine for my needs rough and ready audio tracking with bit cubase on bit windows . my pc is for general use with a non studio configuration no mixer non phantom power mics headphone monitoring .if you re buying for a studio setup requiring phantom power or multiple inputs you ll need a separate mixer and or standalone phantom supply . from the mixer you can cable to the us s line input via rca jacks on the back .there were a couple of hiccups during setup but i don t blame the device . it uses stock o s drivers that loaded right up . the documentation is minimal and only covers up to vista but it s accurate and you ll manage with win . on the windows side make the usb audiocodec your default recording and playback device to override any onboard or card based audio and speakers i have realtek onboard and . desktop speakers .i m using asio all with cubase and cubase crashed a couple of times while configuring vst connections and i o busses . once configured however it s been solid .i d recommend checking out user forums for your particular software platform to find similar gotchas and to set your expectations .on an xp machine changing the default sound devices often means the hassle of toggling settings before and after launching the daw . on win once i unplug the us the settings revert nicely to my desktop speakers . if i plug the us back in the settings revert again very reliable . even better if i want to use cubase strictly for midi the software detects the change and i don t have to reconfigure connections or busses . that may be a function of cubase so again it pays to research your particular software .while the us is connected you ll hear nothing from your computer speakers and have to rely upon the us s headphone jack or audio out rca jacks . this is where the balance control is very helpful . it s not a pan it s a center position gain mixing the computer s output from within your daw as well as outside system sounds with direct monitoring of your input signal . very simple to use for overdubbing . some people may prefer a hard left right pan while overdubbing i can live with the center mix though a switch to toggle a true pan would have been a terrific feature .if you do want desktop speaker playback after your tracks are done there are a number ways to go unplug the us and restart your daw . run a cable from the rca outs on the us to the mini jack aux in on your desktop speakers run a mini jack extension cord from the headphone jack on the us to the aux in .while using the headphone jack the rca audio outs are muted and vis versa . rather than having to pull out the headphone i would prefer a push switch that toggles the front to back output but i can live without it .again the us works great so long as your needs meet its capabilities . you can t rely on the product description or packaging to answer that . fortunately there s enough user information out there for just about any setup it shouldn t be difficult to track down .great stereo sound out of the keyboards .my keys had a single stereo out so this cable was needed to get it to convert to a true channel stereo so we could eq it properly and it worked like a charm . i highly recommend this cable .
this color print paper works great on my epson stylus color printer . the only caveat i have is don t lay the paper down on the clear plastic envelope that holds the paper as there is a sticky strip on the clear plastic that will ruin any paper it touches . also do not leave the print paper out in the light keep it in the dark and in the box until you are ready to use it . great stuff ! is not terribly expensive either .works just fine . not sure what to say . i use it for work . its glossy photo paper . for when you don t want regular paper .i use this paper to print all photo s i take . it does a good job wouldn t use any other paper ! also you can sometimes find it on sale .
it say s that it doesn t fit on my crown vic but it does just to let people know !i recommend it to everyone who has a hi lift jack or something like to buy this product . it fits very snug hard to fall off . it does exactly what it is suppose to .this product will do what is says it will do . that being said it does not inspire confidence in heavy use situations . it does not appear very rugged . nice that it comes with the mount but again the mount is very thin and light and probably won t last very long . also the wire coloring does not match with the standard us codes . white is ground on the item while in most cases in the us black is the ground wire . where was this thing made ? again it is a good price and a useful product but just beware it might be very rugged or reliable . make sure to read the enclosed documentation so that you match your wiring correctly .
it workshighly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering suspension work . you will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover .i hate to use the pickle fork . the pickle fork is the last resort for me as it will damage the balljoint boot .i prefer to use the snap on balljoint remover . if that one cannot fit then i will try this tool . if this tool will not fit then i will resort to a pickle fork .exact replacement from oem . exact fit worked perfect . have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs .
this is the best pencil in the world . writing is crisp and clear . my daughter has used them for all school reports . true to the advertising . my daughter loves them ! thanks to toconderoga website the number on a pencil indicates the degree of hardness or softness of the writing core . the writing core is made from graphite and clay . the more graphite in a pencil the darker the mark . the more clay in a pencil the lighter the mark . for example h is hard b is black f is a fine point and hb is hard and black . ticonderoga pencils are available in five degrees b extra soft black hb soft hard black . f medium fine hf hard fine h extra hard sharpie permanent markers are not only classic markers but they write on abso frickin lutely everything !this cool new pack fine point includes the standard black red blue and green but also includes orange purple brown yellow aqua lime green turquoise and cranberry . these splendid markers also come in chisel tip and ultra fine too if you prefer fatties or skinnies !beautiful vibrant colors that you just can t beat !happy marking !this is a shade of blue black a nice combination color . it is made to fit perfectly a genuine lamy refill replacement .
the fender mini electric guitar stand is not made for the fender squire mini guitar . the guitar falls through . i will have to buy a differant stand for him rendering this one useless . the fender stand for standard guitars will not work on the size ether .this product works as advertised but you should beware . these are right angled and they will not fit in a lot of pedals including the crybaby wah .you have been warned ! ! !it works well for guitars and basses so long as they are the clover style . other then that it works just like it says it will .
i can see this strap lasting a long time . i love how i don t need new strap buttons considering that the screws may be smaller than the original strap button screws which facilitates the strap button falling out and your guitar smacks the limestone floor ! .you can lock each strap button with one hand great product !i received this yesterday in my order . it fits on my guitar fine but i can t seem to get my guitar strap affixed to the head stock strap . the button is so rounded and smooth that my guitar strap just won t go over the top of the button . not sure what to do now .once you install a full dunlop strap lock on a guitar and strap that strap becomes unusable on any guitar that isn t equipped with dunlop buttons . since i only use about straps but have more than guitars it didn t make much sense to buy full strap locks . my only concern when i ordered these buttons was that they might not be exactly like the dunlops and not securely keep the guitar and strap connected .these buttons look and act exactly like the ones that come with a full set of strap locks . after testing a set i have now purchased buttons for most of my guitars . the side benefit is that they are fully functional when used with a guitar strap that is not equipped with the dunlop locks .
as a lot of epiphone owners have learned cases designed for the gibson es clones won t fit epiphone guitars as the epiphones have a slightly larger headstock . this case however fits my dot custom like a glove . the padding is perfect the top is arched to precisely fit the guitar and the build quality is better than you might expect at this price level .the fender mini electric guitar stand is not made for the fender squire mini guitar . the guitar falls through . i will have to buy a differant stand for him rendering this one useless . the fender stand for standard guitars will not work on the size ether .this cover does not fit a full size acoustic electric hohner guitar . i measured the whole at but this cover does not even come close to fitting ! it measures in diameter so check your guitar closely !
works perfectly for both my martin dreadnought and my fender stratocaster . solid unit good material and construction though it is made in china apparently but hey thats why its such a bargain !i purchase this hercules gsp wb a g guitar hanger for my yamaha . is just perfect for what is made for . satisfaction .it is sturdy well made feels hefty in your hands with an extremely smooth action everything the shubb winder is not .well it is made in china while the shubb is made in usa . but what is the point if it is so much inferior ?i think it proves that it is not about where it is made but how it is designed and manufactured .
it s larger than i expected but i will keep it until my son can fit into it . my son is lbs and around inches which is why i bought the large based on the weight recommendation but even the medium is quite large on him right now . would suggest using the height recommendation as a closer indicator of what size to buy rather than weight .it s soft and easy to wear . my daughter like it . if there s newborn size that s will be much better . but small size is suitable too .do not look at the weight ranges when deciding on a size . my son is at the top end of the size large weight range but this item will still fit him for many months . instead look at the height ranges for a more accurate size determination . my tall son is growing out of size month clothing but the size large sleepsack size months will fit him for many more months .
does the job for which it was intended . added to hot water and dissolved pour it into the base of the air o swiss humidifier to clean any scaling and other old water contaminants . then thoroughly rinse without dunking the base under water and do this about every months .i use this filter to fill up my gallon water tank as well as using it inline on the city water connection . that way i m assured fresh clean water if i m dry camping or at a fhu campsite ! sometimes i go the extra distance to fill up a couple of britta water filter bottles and put them in the fridge for cold fresh water !the water coming our of this filter feels almost as good as a home water softener . it will help prevent sediment buildup in your fresh tank . run it for a minute or two before the first use to flush the carbon dust . i cant comment on taste as i bring bottled drinking water but i have used the water for cooking with excellent results .
this is one of those products that you hope you never have to use or take advantage of . but it s a great idea that more manufacturers should get involved with .azoo also offers a similar battery backup unit for about plus they have a self contained ac battery combo pump for continuous use which recharges its volt battery priced at about .one reviewer complained that the power cord didn t work and that his unit only functioned with battery power . news flash ! ! that s the way it s supposed to work ! ! this is a battery backup unit ! !the way it works is simple ac power holds a relay open . when ac power fails the relay closes and completes the battery circuit to power the pump . the power cord serves only to keep the relay open not to power the pump .unlike as in other reviews here the unit i have isn t all that noisy maybe it s a new model . the one thing i don t like about it is a stupidly short power cord only inches ! ! not good for mounting more than inches or so away from the aquarium or high on a wall to prevent backflow . make sure you install a check valve in the air line . also you should know the included air line is way too short .recommended for emergency use . stars . .this is perfect for a backup system for your aquarium . plug it into an outlet put batteries in and then it will turn on automatically when the power is out to that outlet . i plugged mine into the same power strip my filter runs off of so if the filter stops the bubbles will start and save the fish .runs a bit loud but that s to be expected from an emergency backup system . i actually like that it makes noise so you can be alerted that it s running right away so you know something wrong with the power to the tank .takes d batteries but can run on a single battery . i didn t notice a change in output with one vs . two batteries so i m guessing one battery just runs out quicker than with two .as an included bonus you can use this air pump to aid in transporting fish long distances .you can t just add tap water to the fish tank you have to dechlorinate it . this product does just that . it works instantly so it is very convenient . it comes in a nice little bottle with a built in dropper . this lets you easily measure out how much you need . you don t need a lot . i do wish that they had instructions for the amount of drops you need per gallon . it just says to use tsp per gallons which isn t appropriate if you are just doing a water change or if you have a smaller tank .
works just like it needs to . perfect fit for the tailgate on my chevy when the oem clip busted .it a belt . . . it fits it hold and it rotates . there is no noise coming from it .happy with the fit and performance .good bungies nice compact cover can litteraly fit in from fork pouch thin but protective and fit a dyna glide without windshield very well
it s good product to use for aquarium light .because my light hood only takes blubs so i had terrible finding one but here it is .it gives purplish white color but it s better looking then full white spectrum light .recommand this light blub for your tank !not much to say really .you screw it in turn the aquarium lamp on and then you and your fish can enjoy the light .the light is bright and clear crisp white .not yellow not blue but some what of a true white .under this bulb the fish and tank design colors really pop and look good . x better than old school incandescent bulbs .the temperature graphic has a dark green band printed at the most critical ideal temperature range .unfortunately the tiny mercury column is red and provides no contrast to the green ink i find the temperature very hard to read without a strong light . the package graphic shows a strong mercury column and light green ink this is not the case .
this net does what it says . i don t really like that you have to screw into the railing but a child s safety is way more important . it was also a little wonky to size down the length . i wouldn t say it s too stylish either but a person would be hard pressed to find a stylish railing guard . at the end of the day it does what it says and keeps the kid from falling though the railing .i have two very busy almost two year old twins who were fascinated with the power strip in their playroom . this cover isn t the most attractive thing but works . they cannot reach into it or access anything not sure what hole people are talking about and have left it alone . it s about the size of a one liter soda bottle and slides together apart to extend the length . it is tall enough but not quite long enough to secure together firmly on our extra long power strip . it still works however and is the best solution i ve found . would recommend .i bought this at babies r us . it did not fit my rail . it says it fits most standard rails but doesn t give any measurements . how are you supposed to know if it will fit unless you purchase it ? what a pain .
this is a great basic mic stand for live and studio use although i don t suggest using this and playing guitar . great for a lead singer or micing drums and acoutuc instruments . it does not come with a mic clip so you ll need to get one . it s a great deal buy it !does what it says it will do and it does it very well . the connector is a in female slot so make sure whatever it is you re buying can connect to that . the mic boom stand i bought and the on desk stand were both in male so i had to buy cheap adapters each . i also am having some issues really locking in the audio technica condenser mic to the shock mount . so far it stays in but isn t super secure wobbles just a little if it s moved but maybe i m just doing it wrong . aside from that though great product .one thing i love about this extension bar is it will fit over the relatively large diameter down tubes on my hi hat stands . i use anon stage microphone inch gooseneckto connect to the bar then i attach either anady dm drum and instrument microphoneor dm microphone . the bar gooseneck arrangement is sturdy enough for that mic model .this also works well for mounting on microphone stands . i use it and a shorter gooseneck to mount the dm for tenor and alto saxophones or a dm for baritones . again it works perfectly for my situations .i always keep a few of these plus various size goosenecks just in case i need to mount an additional microphone and i am short on stands . it s one more tool to make set up less stressful .trust me when you need one and chances are you will if you re a drummer or a sound tech you will thank yourself for having the foresight to purchase it for situations i cited above and those that i have not foreseen .
this mic is good considering the price . does it sound exactly like a ? no . do it have a decent quality sound ? absolutely . if you re expecting an sm then buy an sm . if you want something close on . a budget this is your mic . great value and good sound .this is a pretty hot pedal ! honestly i have compared this against a suhr riot distortion and an mxr classic distortion and quality wise it is really really hard to not hear the difference in terms of quality tone distortion overdrive . great price and well made . joyo . . .nice job here !this is a really cheap microphone . i m usually amazed how good cheap mics sound e .g . the shure pg line is fantastic but i m not amazed by this mic . it sounds like a cheap mic . it handles high sound pressure ok but sounds tinny and is more prone to feedback than a nicer mic .for the price however you should not expect any better .likes price . this is essentially a toy . stand and cable too !dislikes sound quality . maybe you want a lo fi sound ? you could make it work .overall this is a really good bargain for an extra back up or kids mic . it is not a horrible mic . it is usable for applications like speaking . for hi fi music recording however you ll notice it is a cheap mic .
this adapter works but the clips do not open wide enough to clamp on my battery posts . i was able to attach to the cables coming off the posts albeit barely adhering .i love the simplicity and reliability of this unit . it comes with alligator clips and o ring clips to hardwire to something like my atv . i hardwired the connector to the quad so all i need to do it connect and disconnect the quick connect clips .if monster cable could only see the copper inside this jacket . normally when you cut a piece of heavy cable in the center and strip back the insulation you see nice shiny copper . granted the ends may be oxidized a bit but they are open to the air i cut this at the halfway point to make shorter cable sets or equal cable pieces . this cable while being nice and flexible looked like an old penny inside heavily oxidized and ugly as sin . i suspect its reclaimed copper times over without proper slag removal . that s the only reason i took away one star .also the crimp lugs supplied leave a tad to be desired but they include some properly sized red and black heatshrink . you are supposed to put the stripped cable into the lugs then fold each half over the other with electricians pliers my professional crimper was able to fold them but not close them tight on the wire so out came the persuader a oz claw hammer and some cement . yep that closed the crimp nice and snug on the wire . now it has a good snug grip . i did buy some professional lugs at the hardware store made of copper like a shiny penny and my professional crimper did those justice so their lugs are a tad sub par but you can put them on with just about anything . alternately i could have hit it with a propane torch and fed some solder to it which i may still do if there is excessive loss in the cable . i prefer soldered connections wherever possible .i also bought some nice bolt on attachments at the hardware store for pr that have a bar which snugs down with ea bolts and nuts on the back side . now that was a solid connection i drove the bolts home with my dewalt impact driver and a socket which grabbed the wire and would not let go then gave me a big ring to tie to that did not look like someone pounded a crimp lug with a hammer on cement to make it grab !i realize copper is expensive these days but this stuff was recycled or times over . new copper wire shouldn t look like a s penny under the couch . it sure makes monster cable s oxygen free copper look bright and shiny by comparison . on the other hand i did especially like the fact that the insulation is color coded properly red and black . i have seen high current wiring kits where the wire s insulation is entirely black entirely white or some other way of not coding the positive and negative by insulation color . even the space shuttle wiring is entirely white no matter what purpose it serves . the only identification each white wire gets is a black wrapper with a or digit number that is referenced in the schematics . nasa s wire is also silver plated copper and thus carries the same current of cruddy copper wire size larger with the same loss and less weight at x the price .other than the cruddy copper it s a good value you re getting feet of cable with precrimped lugs on one end and trimmable to length on the other end with a set of lugs you can pound onto the wire . it certainly has the heft of feet of too this shipped at over lbs most of which was the pieces of cable . it ran my inverter just fine so no harm .you also get a green ground wire to tie your inverter chassis to whatever ground you have be it in a car or a ground rod in the earth . like me you probably don t think you need a ground for a battery powered device when wwas the last time you grounded your remote control ? in theory ground wires should cary no current nor any voltage but the spinning fan on the inverter can cause static electricity . you do need to equalize any static charge buildup or leakage in capacitors or alternately stray magnetic fields causing voltage in metalic parts . sure these are small voltages between . and . v but they can flip a logic state if not returned to ground and also making troubleshooting a nuisance . while not absolutely necessary if you don t ground it be sure that somewhere from the output path of the inverter to your load you have a gfci plug . that way if the current finds another path back to the battery or to the inverter chassis it will cut off power in a fraction of a second preventing electrocution yours not to mention damage to the equipment .keep in mind that wire can carry s of amps approaching amps and will do a nice job arc welding . once you get this installed treat it with a great deal of respect . don t be shocked no pun intended when you make the final connection if there is a small arc emphasis on small the reason is that there are capacitors in the inverters that help to smooth out the current flow and they charge instantly when power is applied . when finished disconnect from the battery . use some extra caution when using tools like crecent wrenches around deep cycle batteries don t bridge to the other terminal . i had an electrician drop a crescent wrench inside a pac bell phone central office onto the vdc buss bars that powered the building s phone switch . it didn t even blow the fuse just vaporized the wrench into sputter . we crawled down to the buss bars and there was nothing even resembling a wrench where it made contact with the vdc bars . this product box even has a warning that if you are not familiar with high current wiring have someone who is do it .
there are plenty of rv park type campgrounds out there . however i like the scenic view and smells of a wooded campground . there s just one problem with these . in my area of the country these are usually built on a ridge and the pads aren t always as level as they could be . for owners of most larger rigs you know well that the stablizer jacks have no ability to level a trailer that isn t level . enter the camco tri levelers . back your trailer into within of your intended final stopping point on the pad . lay a pair of these right behind the rear tires of the trailer making sure their parallel with the tires . back up until you ve achived your desired height . on asphalt these will not move . then use a pair of standard chalks to chalk the front tires . after that your set drop your trailer and set it up .why do you need them ? of course camp long enough and you ll see everything from people driving their trailers onto x s to slabs of concrete . these are much safer will not rot will not slide and will not crack . they are study and made of think ridged plastic . each one i would say weighs about lbs so they ll still be lighter than anything else you carry . and they will last forever ! you could safely leave these under your rig for years without worrying about damage from weather or sunlight .why not stars ? three reasons . . . it s not safe to use these on your own without a spotter . an experienced rver can back his rig onto a pad with no assistance . however with these it s just not safe . you could easily back off the back edge since the rear lip is no taller than the ones to each tier of leveling . these are only suitable you rearward sloping pads with minimal side to side slope . due to the face that these are only long they cannot level a tandem axel trailer from side to side as both axels will not touch the leveler . and they are too long to fit a second tri leveler under the front tire for standard trailers . though side to side leveling would be possible for single axel trailers . final placement is important as it could damage your tires especially if being left for a season . when i use them and the trialer is still hiched it pinches the tire . after leveling this seems to go away . but if it didn t and you were concerned for your tires this would mean rehitching and adjusting . each level is only about long by approximately wide . so tire contact can be an issue . for more agressive slopes my recommendation after using them a couple of times . drive you rig onto them until the rear of the chock whichever level your using is pinching your tire . and making sure you don t drive off the back ! then when you let the tongue down it will stop pinching and sould be just right .final thoughts . . . these levelers are purpose built for the most common type of leveling . they do very well at that . they don t do well with other types of leveling . though i suppose you could use them with a foward slope as well if you were creative with your tongue jack . if it seems like i m being critical of them i m just trying to give an honest review . i do think they are a great well built product that is worth owning if you enocounter this type of issue with your trailer . if you have issues with side to side leveling there are other products out there that will suit you better as well as cost you more . personally i own both since i never know what type of situation to expect . i like the simple design . no assemlby means they re easy to move . unless the situation requires it i will always grab these first for just that reason . one final thing to consider . anytime you raise a tire or pair of tires on your trailer you re obviously going to have a more significant rise on the end of your trailer . make sure your carrying something to let you sill use your stablizing jacks .this seems to be one of the better levelers . there are two different scales on these levels . one is for the side to side back of the coach and the other is for the front to back side of the coach . the reason there are different scales are they are more or less calibrated in inches .for example it is simple trigonometry to determine how many inches the coach is out of level simply by using the formula for right angles and solve for one side . the input values are the angle determined by the level and distance from the level to the point at where you want to know how many inches of lift are needed .for the side to side level the markings are pretty accurate as long as you put the scale in the center of the coach as most coaches are within an inch or two of width from another . however for the front to back level even though you put the scale in the center the result will vary wildly due to the length of the coach . using this level on a ft coach will result in a far different measurement than say a ft coach .also if you don t put the level in the center in the side or back then the two ends of the coach will be different . for example if the level is in the center then when the level measures off level that means on either front or back . but if you put the level off center then the level reading might truly be on one end and on the other . again it is simply a principle of right angles in trigonometry .also do not rely on the self adhesive backing as over time it can move . as hard as it may be for you to do drilling a couple holes and inserting screws into the levels is the best bet .i grew up in the s so i remember well playing with legos . building everying from cars to forts . well the tri lynx comapny has brought us back our nostalic youth with tri lynx levelers . these are large square plastic pads roughly x x thick that are stackable to just about any confgiuration you can imagine . you can stack them in a column fasion for leveling jacks . or you can stack them in an offset alternating brick wall fasion for an interlocking leveler that is safe to drive on without fear of displacement . they can even be stacked side by side for larger duel wheel rvs . for my use i wanted to use them for my leveling jacks and for pads were there was a side leaning tilt . the box says to never stack more than levelers high for a single configuration . i ve gone to under my jacks and they still feel rock solid once pressure is put on them .i m on my th set of lynx levelers . i m convinced you can t have too many . with that i fianlly invested in these stop n chocks wonderful ! ! ! as i said these can be used under your wheels as well . so the stop n chalk stacks as the last piece at the rear of the lynx configuration to allow the driver just back up against them . now these are the most versitle set of leveling chalking pads you can buy becasue they allow for front to rear leveling and side to side leveling . if one side of the coach is lower than the other you can build up just that side and use standard chalks on the other . also if you have enough of the tri lynx levelers you could potentially place say of lift under a front axel on an tandem configuration and or even under a rear . the one draw back is that you would need enough to building this as one continous pad say long or so . but like legos if you have enough your imagination is the limit .a couple of notes you must use these in conjunction with trilynx levelers . they will not work on their own . in addition there is a noctch carved out of the front to force the user to stack in the above mentioned brick wall alternating fasion so that there s no risk of sepertaion between the levels as the rig is driving on or off the pad . also i stongly suggest a spotter ! driving a rig on or off a wide rail is dangerous and having someone to tell you that you a little too close to the edge is a must .
works as advertised . the labels do warp a bit with age but this does not affect how they print or attach .works just fine . not sure what to say . i use it for work . its glossy photo paper . for when you don t want regular paper .this tape does exactly what it s supposed to do ! it s virtually invisible on wrapping paper and holds everything in place .
i have two different laser printers each with a special envelope slot that is meant to feed envelopes so that you can print an address directly on each envelope . there are two problems with both . first you can feed only one envelope at a time they won t accomodate a stack of envelopes . secondly half of the time the envelope jams and you must pull the printer apart to fix the problem . so i have given up on running envelopes through my laser printers .the avery easy peal mailing label sheets fit into the standard . by tray and feed flawlessly through the print track . i can print labels in less than a minute and each label peels off the backing easily and can be stuck to an envelope or package quickly .the drawback is you must run a sheet of labels through the printer even if you need only one label . but if you have a lot of mailing to do this generous quantity of labels helps get the job done quickly and inexpensively .so far so good . . . i print a few labels at at time on a page so i may often put the same sheet back in my printer several times . not having the white column separation paper in between the columns helps eliminate the chance of jamming . removing a label from the page is easy and trouble free . for my type of use it seems a good choice . thumbs up !these tabs are really great and save a lot of time when you are preparing a lesson plan . the idea is to use them to indicate where the chapters start so that you can easily flip to the right page and not waste a bunch of effort paging through the book . we only use one chapter at a time and these tabs are just the thing to make it easier .
as far as foot rests go this one is pretty nice . large enough for my size feet to have plenty of room so i can sit comfortably at my desk . the up down swivel feature makes it easy to obtain different inclines instantly so that i m not forced to sit with my feet at a constant angle but can rock the top of the foot rest back and forth as desired . i like to sit barefoot sometimes at my desk at home and the top of the foot rest has a rough grip adhesive but it s not at all painful to my feet in any way . when barefoot though i must be careful not to run my toes too hard along the outside edges of the footrest lest i might get a cut . with shoes on this will never be a problem but it is made out of sheet steel metal and the edges on the sides though not sharp could hurt if you suddenly slid your bare foot along it .other than that it s a good footrest . it makes it easier for me to sit in my chair and use my computer . before i got the footrest i was using all sorts of other things to try and rest my feet on but they never worked well for very long . the height is adjustable i like it at it s highest setting because my legs can get extremely tired if no extra support is given to ease the strain on them while sitting in my chair . i have long legs and the distance from my hips to my knees is about or more inches beyond the edge of my chair seat and after a while that part of my legs gets tired . the footrest raises them off the edge of the chair enough to relieve the pressure and i can sit comfortably for a long time before getting tired .this foot rest is heavy . it has very rough surface that can hold your shoes in place . you won t feel slippery . it has two height adjustments . you can swing it back and forth . very comfortable and sturdy .the stand wobbles a bit going side to side but not enough to really be a problem . the legs stackable things to change height don t lock in place so they keep falling apart while trying to move the stand around .
my ski club like to name name tags available so new members can meet people and these works great with all types of fabric .easy way to print up name badges for your next meeting or get together . they are large enough to print the names big enough for people to see them . they look very professional . no more handwritten name badges . avery labels are easily printed in word . i highly recommend these name badge labels .i tried another brand of badge labels months ago so this is a comparison with that other brand which i won t name because frankly this product works just as well .name tags are a necessary item when you are meeting with folks you don t see often . but name tags are also great for things like rpgs where you want your players to interact as their characters not themselves . i primarily use these labels for convention games because it helps get everyone in the proper state of mind .people wear all types of clothing so i need labels that won t damage them . these come off of almost any type of fabric but here s a warning it does not come off of paper or plastic . so think before you apply them .the sheets worked well in my printer and were easy to use and store . these are inexpensive forms of name tags when the people meeting changes often or you meet rarely . if you need name tags more often i d go with plastic ones you can use over and over again .
i use this mirror in the office to see if there is anyone coming to my desk . i sit with my back to the aisle and i was startled many times by people who d stand behind me and snoop on my computer activities .i attached this mirror to the upper left corner of my monitor using the douple sided tape that was pre attached to the mirror s back and secured it additionally with a couple of scotch tape strips . now with my periferal vision i notice if there is a reflection change in the mirror and i will be aware if anyone is approaching my desk .i receive the unit with a black power adapter not white color like the picture show . but no big deal !it comes with all mounting screws and stripes of foam double side tapes . i will not use these tapes these are some cheap foam type . i don t think it will hold for long . i use black m heavy duty exterior double side tape for mounting . i did not use screws because i mount the laser unit underneath the garage door opener . for ceiling mount screw is still the best ! i use heat gun to warm up the these tape for mounting it works like a glue !this unit comes with a mounting bracket first you have to mount the bracket than hook the laser unit onto the bracket . however the laser unit is not secure on the bracket . it can come loose very easy ! which mean it can fall onto your car . so i add an electric tape at the back of the unit now the unit stays !the red laser is bright and clear it can be see clearly in day light . the laser will turns on and stay on about to minutes . v battery for power outage backup is also a great feature !great buy !after i got my cv from the auction i ordered some fancy new headlight bulbs for it . they did not come with aiming instructions which seems silly if you ask me but who asked me right ! .if you ve ever searched the web for headlight aiming instructions good luck ! no two are alike ! i contacted the manufacturer of the bulbs and even they had vague instructions . this is the best explanation i found . . . step one . . . put some gas in the tank . the adjustment will fluctuate a little depending on how much gas you have in the tank yes i did it on empty the first time and had to re adjust the height . and other load spring shock conditions .on a flat surface you drive the car as close as you can up to a wall and mark the center of the headlight beams . this varies from bulb to bulb and can range from a well defined rectangle to a somewhat defined top and a vague bottom . some bulbs have a kind of a z that you align where is zigs and zags .now back your vehicle up . this is an industry rule of thumb not a mystery as some manufacturers may have you believe . my lights were shining on the ground at this point waaaay off !on the back of your lights are little screws with mm hex heads . the top ones towards the outside of the car are for up and down the lower ones towards the inside of the car are for left and right . i tried pliers . . . no good i tried that little crescent wrench . . . no good i went to sears and bought that pretty miniature set of metric wrenches that goes down to mm for what was i thinking . . . and i was actually able to do some adjusting by turning and turning the wrench back and forth back and forth dropping it into the frame . . . you know what i m talkin bout ! . . . i did discover if you re short of cash and have a little wrench already that by taking the yellow bulb assembly out of the headlight that the little wrench will spin around without taking it off the post .since my daughter and i both have these cars i decided to look for a real adjustment tool and found this lisle product . wow ! now i can do both headlights up and down and right and left in the time it took me to do one screw before ! this thing fits perfectly it ratchets smoothly and you can pop it on and off easily ! it s like a miracle tool ! note to self ! ! ! do not back the adjuster screw all the way to the metal panel behind it with the tool on the screw ! the tool won t come off and you can t reverse the tool other than to remove it from the screw and turn it around ! and no i didn t actually do this but i came darn close !k i digress sorry about that ! now you have your car backed up from the wall hood open radiator access panel removed there s a little thumb screw you turn if you re lucky . lights on low beam then cover one of the lights with a dark towel or something and it will be easier to see the light you re working on .vertical adjustment up and down . . . at this point there are several variations of the rule . i have found on my car that aligning the top on the headlight pattern at or just below the horizontal centerline for the lights that i marked on the wall is good . this is pretty easy to see for any of the bulbs that i have been using .horizontal adjustment side to side . . . this varies a lot ! the recommendations in the link in this post has you align the driver s side of the beam rectangles this varies from aligning the centerline of the beam rectangles to two inches to the right of the centerline in some recommendations and various other recommendations just up to the vertical centerlines that we marked on the wall . if you can actually see a definite outline of the beans this might work . on one car the beams are defined on the other i can not see a defined left or right edge on the wall so i had to play it by ear and eyeball the adjusters so as to not get them too far in or out erring on what i thought to be aiming the beams more to the passenger side of the centerlines . keep in mind that the goal is to illuminate the shoulder passenger side of the road the lane you are traveling in and i believe to illuminate somewhat the oncoming lane without blinding the other driver .commonsense and a test drive will tell you if you have it right . if the street signs are glowing like the sun from a mile down the road you re aimed too high ! a quick check of the high beams while in front of the wall may verify your aim . you do not adjust high beams they are supposed to be self aiming when the low beams are aimed however they should be somewhat centered over those centerlines we marked earlier .the glory of this tool was then when i did the test run with the radiator access cowling off already and i could see the beam was too far towards the driver s side middle of the road i just pulled off the road opened the hood and popped the adjusting tool on the screw easily flipped it a few turns you will know which way after you adjust it a few times and it came out perfect !please verify all information this can be dangerous for everyone if it s not done correctly . safe driving !
finally a phone that you don t need to plug into an electrical outlet no power supply needed just a phone jack .it s just right for it s a steal .you learn that when there is a power outage the cordless will not work because the base is plugged into the electrical socket so its a good little phone to have plugged into a landline that s there when you need it even if you have a cell phone . . . .because you could have a low battery and this landline though to some out dated it sure helps in a pinch . !when you need a phone during an emergency or power outage when you want a phone that is reliably located on the base where someone hasn t walked away with the handset this is the ideal phone ! the phone comes with a longish cord to plug into the phone base and phone jack . if you need the standard short cord to use with a typical wall mounted base there is a slot under the base to wrap the cord instead of providing a shorter second cord . i like this ! it s nice that companies are engineering with cost savings in mind ! the phone comes with pulse and tone dialing needed to use computerized dialing . 
they fit my aquaclear . it s a snug fit but they fit . great for extending the intake tube as far down as possible .this is a well built super strong lb capacity ramp that performs as advertised . for the money it is probably the best one that you can buy . i bought this and was impressed with the quality but i m sending it back . here s why . this thing is huge x inches and weighs lbs . due to the weight and size you cannot easily fold it pinched my fingers then it takes up a lot of space in the rear of your vehicle . my lab refused to walk on it which created a further training issue . i also purchased a dog crate for the back of my suv which also had to be returned . due to size restrictions of the vehicle my dog just barely fit in it . a good plan that fell apart .i found a solution . purchased from amazon was a luxury bench rear seat cover . it s a heavy duty quilted polyester water resistant non slip cover for the rear seat . it has a hammock fitting option that totally covers the rear seat and back of the front seat area . the manufacturer is knines . basically your dog is restricted to this one area containing the mess and hair and not destroying the rest of your car . it works . this product is fully washable . this is a viable option you may wish to consider .this is a good harness . it fits my lb yorkie he s larger than average but not fat . when we travel i use this harness with the kurgo automobile zip line so he can go back and forth in the back seat . the harness allows me to pick him up and put him in or out of my car easily . it is easy to put on and remove with just one buckle on his back .
do not look at the weight ranges when deciding on a size . my son is at the top end of the size large weight range but this item will still fit him for many months . instead look at the height ranges for a more accurate size determination . my tall son is growing out of size month clothing but the size large sleepsack size months will fit him for many more months .the quality of this sleeper is good . it s soft and has a cute design . the only problem is that it is huge . i ordered a large based on the description my baby girl is months old . i think i could have fit of her length wise into the sleeper . i returned it for a medium and the medium is still huge . i also would prefer it to have sleeves . i am a huge fan of the carter s sleepers . they are perfect and have sleeves . but they come in one size months . my month old is just about to grow out of it length wise which is why i ve been looking for something bigger .i have no complaints about this . i did all my research before purchasing ie measuring the size of my daughters changing table . . .and this was a great fit . she s now months yes just writing this review now and we still use it . her size huggies diapers fit fine and of course you get a lot more newborn diapers in there . all her creams lotions and accessories fit in the side compartments . very pleased .
i give my year old car a full cleaning treatment at least twice a year . about a month ago when i just finished my pre winter car cleaning ritual a neighbor walked by and ask me if it was a new car shining in my drive way . that s when you know the wax did its job well .meguiar gold liquid wax not only does a great job it is easy to work with if you follow simple steps below washi wash the car first using a detergent designed for car washing as it removes the grime better . i use microfiber towels to wash . what you use to wash makes a big difference a good micro fiber towel makes the job go faster and it does a good job with the smallest amount of effort .be cooli wash either in the shade or in the evening when the sun is not strong . strong sun will dry out the water too soon and working with dry finish can lead to small abrasions . hot paint finish is also easier to damage . so i make sure the car is cool while i am working on it . i wash the top of the car then the bottom of the car . i don t want dirty water streaming down on the clean portions .drythen i dry the car which helps remove whatever dirt might have remained on the car after the wash . i use more micro fiber towels . i like costco s micro fiber towel bag for you get a big bag of high quality towels of just the right size .clayi check the car for any dirt that the water did not take off and clay those areas . i don t clay the entire car just the areas where i see imperfections .waxi apply the wax to another micro fiber towel spread it on a small portion of the car feet by feet then wipe it off with another micro fiber towel . if you let the wax sit too long it will become difficult to buff off that s why working on small areas is better . if i drop a towel i move on to the next one . even tiny dirt particles you can t see will scratch the paint surface . i try avoid getting wax on plastic parts . if i do get it on the plastic parts see back to black described below .back to blackthe final step is to apply back to black solution to plastic parts of the car . it makes the plastic look new and it is not harmful to the painted surfaces . back to black solution effectively removes any wax residue you might have gotten on to the plastic parts it also takes care of the sun damage to the plastic .this procedure takes me about an hour . i love riding in a shiny clean car plus i always get great value back when i sell my cars .meguiar s gold wax is one of my secret weapons to make a four year old car look like new . i recommend it !ali julia reviewi love these microfiber cloth ! i use them to clean everything ! mostly for my cars ! they do not leave scratches on your car and can be use for almost anything !used in place of the cheap microfiber cloths and was truly impressed with how quick they cleaned and polished interior of car and also i use one to wipe down chrome wheels . leaves them streakless . thanks .
i have a parakeet cockatiel and a small parrot and the cockatiel size works for all three birds they all like these nutriberries a lotthe fish really like this food item although i thought it would be a little larger in size . roughly a good replacement for chow mein noodles as a prank on a friend lol . types of fish that like it in juvinile and mature sizes that i have that eat it clown knifes parrot cichlid varying african cichlids texas cichlids osphronemus gorami even the really large ft ones love it got this for under on sale . decent sized container . my dwarf gourami and betta seem to enjoy the granules as do my tetras .
this is a nice steering wheel cover . i m not completely sure its leather but it feels nice . i read reviews where buyers are one starring this product saying its plastic and one even said he cut a chunk out for his to see if it was leather . i m going to say this . if you want something that smells like top grain italian leather this is not the product nor the price range you need to be looking for and it definitely isn t the expectation you should have if you paid less than for a product . for that price you get what you get regardless of what the manufacturer may claim . reviewers on amazon kill me with unrealistic expectations like products that are purchased at low costs like this one should be perfect and expensive grain leather is unrealistic and ignorant . a nice cover it is . top grain leather it is not at least not for . want top quality ? spend multiples of the cost of this product ! ! ! ! i like mine and itinstalled in a snap .it fucntions ok for being all plastic . and for the price i wont complain .of course made in china but ok for the price . useful to have but don t bank on it if you exceed pounds not as stated . the receiver tube is of a thinner gauge hence it feels light . the hook feels solid and the inside weld is plentiful . remember a chain is as strong as its weakest link .i give three stars because of the price delivery but not the quality . ok for light duty use
this is a great value . i contacted the company for measurements inside the case to see if it would fit an ibanez rg series . it fits perfectly . thank youi have this paired with the behringer c studio condenser microphone . it matches the mic well color wise and fit . the c fits the mount perfectly . i recommend this mount highly .http www .amazon .com behringer c studio condenser microphone dp b cz rlk ref sr ?ie utf qid sr keywords behringer c i purchased this to work with my ion system and my shure mic . arrived as expected very solid great fit . it works ! ! ! !
the wolo model ba heavy duty commercial grade back up alarm is perfect for the rear of any rv of size . it s small about wide x tall and deep and loud enough to alert anyone you are backing . the sound is exactly like what you hear on garbage trucks and many commercial vehicles .wiring the unit is simple and one of the mounting bolt screw holes automatically grounds the horn to the vehicle chassis . i used the backup light wiring in the truck to trailer cable that was not used by my trailer to get the volt positive voltage to the trailer . i then connected to the trailer wiring block using a gauge hot lead to take the voltage to the backup alarm mounted on the read of the trailer . whenever i have the trailer attached to the truck and then shift the truck into reverse bingo . the alarm begins beeping . of course anytime the truck backup lights are activated like using the key fob to shut off the truck burglar alarm the backup horn activates for about seconds .this extension cable allows me to hook up my battery tender plus to any vehicle in the garage . the polarized end connectors maintain the proper polarity and that is important when charging batteries .this four station battery tender is just as simple to use as the single units . one simply plugs the unit in and connects the battery via alligator clips or a connection affixed to the battery . its a simple task to tell what state the battery is in . if amber the battery is deep charging if green range it is to charged . after the battery is charged leaving in connected will put the unit in float mode which will keep the battery topped off without damaging it . my only concern is the housing is plastic and all of my single units are metal . it does have mounting holes so it can be wall mounted or affixed more securely to a shelf etc . like the single units total time from opening the box to charging is about minutes .by the way instructions for deciphering the state of the amber and green lights are not in the instruction manual but on the right side of the unit .i also ordered the foot extension cables a good call if you need to have your batteries more than about four feet from the unit .
use with canon printer and canon inks for outstanding color prints . have compared canon to other papers and canon papers always is my choice .i had been using an hp business inkjet printer and hp photo paper for a long time . i thought the prints were pretty good from the hp inkjet printer until i recently bought a canon photo inkjet printer and some canon photo paper with the canon printer .to make a long story short the hp photo paper whether used in my hp inkjet printer or my new canon inkjet printer is trash next to this canon photo paper . the hp paper takes far too long to dry and ink pools on it for a long time . this canon photo paper has a much nicer finish and the print quality seems much better to me on top of the fact that ink does not pool on it and it dries much faster than the hp paper .after trying this good canon photo paper i actually tossed out my remaining hp paper never to use it again . i had trouble with every hp printer i d ever bought laser printers and inkjet printer and hp photo paper is trash next to this canon photo paper . i definitely recommend this canon photo paper .i also tried some canon photo paper plus glossy ii and found that it has a slight orange peel texture to the surface of it and doesn t seem quite as glossy as this canon photo paper glossy .the ink cartridge is o .k . but the epson r printer is a huge ink hog . the epson printer s that use this cartridge should all be recalled .
bought these because we were using a medela pump and philips bottles . of course the breast pump and bottle industry can t make it easy for everything to work together . these adapters fit great onto the pump and the philips bottles . don t feel forced to buy all new bottles or a brand new pump just to make your system work !the listing doesn t specify that do come in a package . yea ! they work wonders when you are storing your breastmilk right from pump to bottle . it has a tight seal to prevent any milk spilling and you can just add the nipple when ready to use for feeding . a must have for breastfeeding moms .these bottles are the best for switching between bottle and breast . my daughter hardly ever has to take a bottle but when she does she has no problem with these . she would try to inhale smaller nipples because they didn t have the broad base like the breast does and like these playtex nipples do . plus playtex now has a storage system for pumping into the liners . this set comes with an adapter to connect to the pump and some caps . you can also buy more caps . they make it so easy to store milk and then just pop it on the bottle . the adapter definitely works with the medela pumps . i think it will work with all except maybe avent .
hard to mess up a floating square . it does contain the food .negatives . . . .to me at least the post that attaches it to the side is long . this puts it far from the corner .overall size float size is l x w . pretty large .inside float dimensions are approx . l x w .this ring could be reduced by a third or half . the foam material does support algae and is quite visible unless you keep the water level up to the black trim .i m used to a simple x clear plastic ring with trapped air floats . this type stays in the corner with the surface tension of the water .all in all i ll use it but wouldn t buy another due to the size .i orderd this for my g tall . the picture is deceiving . there is a front piece of glass and a back piece of glass and then a small piece of plastic . if you have a hob filter or anything somewhat big you will not be able to use this canopy . junk .it s great to use for your chick brood as you can slide the flat bar under the edge of the chick brooder . it adjusts to the height you need weekly for newly hatched chicks . i wish i had purchased !
got mine for under and it s a great mic . i can use it for vocal tracks or recording for webcasts that kind of thing or recording studio guitar sounds etc . awesome mic .i ve used this mic with my tascam us audio interface and pc to record a high school chorus concert and have gotten very good audio reproduction from this microphone . i placed one of these microphones as a soloist microphone and one as a piano instrument microphone and have gotten great results from both . the reproduction of the sound was very good . the mic seems very solid in build and able to possibly take a little abuse which is good with a travelling recording system but i definately wouldn t try dropping one even though they re a nice metal case and metal grill . i d recommend these mics to anyone looking to get a good reproduction of sound for both vocals and instrumentals on a budget . i have yet to try these with micing guitar amps but that s my next step as well as drums .this microphone is great for singing with a pa and an electric guitar . i sing worship praise songs and southern gospel and it is very smooth in the mid range and when you get up close it enhances the bass nicely . i don t think it is the same as an sm but it is exactly what i need . built to last and it is a shure .
i thought this twisty toy would be something new fun for my month old to chew on . i m not a huge fan . mostly because i think it s too awkward and big for a baby to try and hold and get their mouth around . she hits herself in the face a lot too trying to get it into her mouth . maybe when she is older she can play with it just for fun but as a teether it s not functional .i have a . mo old who loves when we tap on toys when he has them in his mouth yes sounds weird . husband is a drummer and got him obsessed with the tapping even when he is drinking out of his bottle my baby will try to tap the bottle with his hands to feel the vibration . he has a mini dodge ball and he sticks his face mouth on the ball and all you have to do is tap the ball and he s a happy baby . i also bought an infant gum massager electric toothbrush because he was always interested when i brush my teeth . he loves that as well but has to be supervised so he doesn t choke you think for long skinny objects made for babies that they would make a guard block to prevent any type of choking .this teether will be better if it had an on off button my baby not able to bite down hard enough to turn it on and once again we have to hold it for him to turn it on . i was trying to find a teether with vibrations he can use by himself .this product sucks . my little boy loves to chew on things while he s teething and he bites down hard . he was never able to bite hard enough to get this dumb thing to vibrate . very disappointing .
i use this to prop open my heavy office door which is on an automatic closing system that closes and locks the door soon as you release it .the national hardware wedge is long and sturdy enough to hold this type of door open however it lacks enough rigidity to truly do the job . you tend to want to kick it into the door so it wedges into the opening at the bottom but this particular door stop isn t strong enough to be used that way it flexes and bends rather than sliding further under the door . because of this eventually the weight of the door wins and it gradually closes pushing the door stop out of the way .also unlike the product description which says gray the unit i received is dark brown .i suppose it s a fair product for the price but if you have a large heavy door or maybe one on a spring loaded door closer you ll want something more .very basic pencil sharpener that works exactly like i would expect it should . cord is long enough to run behind a desk and plug in on a power strip on the floor . the unit is all black no silver grey color on the front as pictured in the stock photo . also it has the product name on the front which is also not pictured on the stock photo . easy to empty the shavings there is a small drawer on the front of the unit that slides open to dump them out . the drawer stays securely shut when you want it to so even if you lean the sharpener forward it wont accidentally slide open .sharpens pencils fine . no lopsided sharpening or sharpening in a way that causes the lead to break inside and slide out . an adult finger will not fit into the sharpening hole but small kids fingers could so keep out of their reach .great sharpener at a inexpensive price .great door stops ribbed on top and bottom . for really large gaps two can be interlocked and hold the door open .
we bought the plantronics hl handset lifter to go with ourplantronics cs dect . digital wireless office headsetand have been very pleased with both devices . using the handset lifter give you the ability to answer calls directly from the wireless headset which is good if you spend a lot of time away from the physical phone to which the headset unit is connected .setup was amazingly easy just following the directions allowed us to get this installed in just a few minutes on our very inexpensive no name speaker phone .like our plantronics headset this has passed the test of time and i would buy a new one if it failed today .highly recommended !cfhvalue performer gets new lookba users may like to know that texas instruments has released a new look ti ba allow me to call it it ba n which may come with just more than cosmetic improvements over the popular ba .improved lcd displayi was able to observed from a short distant away that the lcd display of the ba n is clearer and more contrasty than the orginal ba which i own . ti gets a thumbs up for doing this improvement quietly plus giving a facelift to this already highly regarded value for money business financial electronic calculator .did texas instrument killed some bugs in the ba ?although i have not yet been able to test the ba n ti may have also incorporated some improvements and killed some bugs on the popular ba . it is also probable that some improvements or new functions incorporated on the september released ba professional ba pro may also have been also incorporated into the specs of ba n .i would like to believe that some small but extremely annoying bugs of the original ba has been quietly fixed on the ba n . in particular i wish to see the reset button nuisance which clears all user input formatting on the ba has been done alway with . most users of ba would know that an accident user soft reset would return to the default number of periods per year p y to this would upset the results of many tvm calculations when user has set the p y to to use the calculator in number of periods instead .battery replacement woes on the ba i was not able to exam a unit of the ba n to see if end users would still need a screw driver to unscrew and pry open the ba casing just to replace the cr battery . it would be nice if ti would incorporate a user accessible slide open battery compartment for the ba n or future upgrades of the ba .my recommendationwould be buyers should get hold of the ba n or buy the ba pro if you have a bigger budget . budget conscious users could see that for the price of a ba pro a screw driver and spare batteries new users could afford to purchase for themselves two sets of ba n .an advantage of having a spare ba n set on hand is that users could free themselves from the trouble of carrying a philips screwdriver and replacement lithium batteries to important assignments or to the examination centre .how different does the ba n looks ? i have downloaded the ba n jpeg picture from ti s calculator site and posted it to the amazon s picture gallery .important note i have commented on the ba n as an end user and i don t work for ti hp or any of the manufacturers for the products which i have used reviewed and posted my comments on the pages of amazon .com . it is my pleasure to be able to share my first look at the ba n with you thanks for reading !this is an excellent cordless hands free phone as long as you do not have any other wireless devices at home . i have been using this phone for several months now and i have a wireless g network at home . this phone completely shuts down my entire wireless network . i have tried everything from changing the channel on the wireless network to changing the channel on the phone but the problem is resolved only temporarily . it somehow changes its own channel to the same one that my wireless network is running resulting is total disruption of all computers and laptops . not only does it interfere with my wireless network it is also affected by microwave oven . if you are talking in the kitchen and using microwave at the same time this phone will pick up the waves from your microwave creating so much noise that you can barely talk . i have used other cordless phones before and none of them created this kind of wireless hell that this device does . after using it for several months the disadvantages outweigh its advantages and i am looking for a substitute .
this is very clever in the sense that you can clip the magnets to a whiteboard that lacks a ledge to hold pens .but i ve tried each of the colors and even the dark colors purple green black are so thin as to be practically invisible .the light colors yellow blue for some reason the red barely are readable either .not sure how these could help or be useful !these are such lovely vibrant colors really sharp and clear and bright . they show up wonderfully on dark paper . very pleased with the effect . colors orange blue green yellow and red folders of each color .the two brighter colors are orange and yellow . the blue is more like medium sky blue lighter than the picture red and green are as shown in the picture .the only problem is that the inside pockets are fairly stiff and there is no cut out in the center to help the paper go in easily it takes a bit to get the paper to slide in . i may try cutting out a slant on the inside of each pocket and see if that helps with sliding the paper in .
these comes in a box of small plastic bags in two rolls of bags per roll . the bags are similiar in size to ones you can purchase in a grocery store or lowes or home depot . they are hooked together with a perforation between the bags and are easily pulled apart . i purchased these bags at the same time as the shredder because i did not know if they were actually needed to catch the shreddings . they aren t . the bags are placed over the removable shredder bin and when the bin is pushed back into place you are left with a view of an ugly plastic bag . for office use the view is not a significant factor but if using at home in a location that is highly visible it may be worth considering the shredder use w o the ugly bags on display . you really don t need any bags .you can get of these ugly fellowes bags for . . or you can get glad bags of similiar size at lowes for one half that amount . the main difference is that the fellowes bags come packed with a supply of ties whereas the glad bags have the ties built in far more convenient and the bags are significantly less ugly . i give the fellowes bags three stars for two main reasons . first because they are ugly to begin with but also imprinted with black typeface in numerous languages which is an additional major contributor to their ugliness . second the price is outrageous and totally unwarranted .we use these plastic bags with the fellowes powershred ps cs shredder . using some of type of bag with this shredder is a virtual necessity . without a bag a complete mess occurs in the process of emptying the bin . these bags do a suitable job of collecting the shredded paper .the bags fit comfortably in the shredder although the top hangs over the front of the bin and is visible . they do seem to be overpriced considering that they are made of flimsy plastic . i imagine someone could fabricate a suitable substitute bag for less money . but since the cost is cents per bag and a bag lasts us for several weeks it really does not seem to be worth the time and effort to find a substitute .bankers boxes come in very handy for storing anything from files to toys to holiday decorations or anything else you need to stash away . these boxes are easy to assemble easy to carry and easy to stack . plastic storage containers might be a little cheaper on sale at retail stores .
using a little permatex dielectric grease on the spark plug connectors will help remove them later as well as sealing out moisture .eventually . if the o sensor leaves mangled threads this will clean them up without having to pull the manifold . great toolreplaced the washer nozzles on a subaru outback with these . they spray an even mist which i like .i had replaced the driver side nozzle years ago with parts from the dealer and the one nozzle was . item was also very easy to install hardest part is figuring out how to get the old nozzle out . in my car once i pulled the hose off the nozzle shaft it was just a matter of tilting the nozzle shaft forward or backwards and it popped right out . hope this helps no instructions come with the kit .
honestly the filter is a good filter as i got one from petsmart a year ago and was looking to add more filtration to my tank . the one from petsmart gets out of stars . i subtracted one from it because i have converted to cannisters . now onto my experience of ordering this product from amazon which gets one star . . .i ordered two of these filters and both were cracked broken . the first one i immediately discovered when taking the filter out of the box as the sharp plastic piece that was broken on the bottom lip of the filter was very sharp and almost cut me . i immediately returned the filter and went to order another one thinking that i just had bad luck and it got damaged during transit . the second one came in and looked a little banged up but i didn t notice anything too bad except a few scratches . it was months later when i noticed that my floor was wet that the nd one had a very small crack in it on the same side as the cracked first one and that water was slowly leaking out of down the side of the tank onto the floor . i would not order this product from amazon as they are for with this product . i have since ordered a canister . i am not a happy customer as i do not think i will be able to return it as it has been months since i purchased .i broke my old cover years old the last time i cleaned the filter . fast shipping and fit like a glove given that it was a manfactuers piece that is to be expected . the fluval cansiter series is fantastic very little maintenance and just keeps working i have only replaced the impeller once and i replaced this cover and the o ring on my in years . what a long term bargain this is .and now the magnet is in pieces instead of one . after a very short time the magnet separates and causes the impeller to stop turning . i have called the company several times about this and they send me new impeller assemblies that has the same failure .i have of these units and the newer ones i have purchased all fail . this is a problem on newer models . the older models have a piece magnet and are no trouble . everyone that is having a problem check the magnet and see if it is starting to split in half
pee and poop odors are the worst when house training dogs . this is the only cleaner that eliminates the odor so well that my dog doesn t return to the area to do his business .whenkeep off ! repellentwasn t doing the job for me i tried to find something better . boundary makes strong claims but ultimately it s the same product as keep off . from the label it s clear that at least of the ingredients are the same but the undisclosed other ingredients might not be different either . both products smell the same . the active ingredients are the same . a close look at the labels shows that out of the many paragraphs of text most are the same word for word .i had higher expectations from lambert kay . theirfresh n clean oxy strength cat odor stain eliminatoris the best odor eliminator i have found . but with boundary they are selling a product that may repel cats for a while but might not keep them away for an entire day . i expect that this will work for some people . some cats are likely to dislike it but not necessarily enough to stay away .i would not go so far as to say it doesn t work . if you buy this you will be taking a chance . for some percentage of customers it will be an ideal solution . but don t expect a guarantee .what can i say ? it s clumping cat litter . it does exactly what it is supposed to and the cats don t run from it howling . this is not my favorite brand but that just speaks to my preferences and not the quality of the litter . if you need litter delivered this is a good choice .
i dont use the tray top but the bottom part is great in that it fits easily under the table unlike my other high chair which claimed it would work as a booster but couldnt fit under any tables and has a couple of levels to move him down as he grows taller .so it s not an eddie bauer high chair . it s not fancy but it is easy to clean and it buts snugly on most chairs .this bowl is cute and difficult for my daughter to lift and throw . however if your high chair has a smaller tray this bowl will not fit . for example we have thefisher price healthy care deluxe booster seat blue and the bowl does not fit on the tray it is too large for the tray .
this pedal has been on the market for a very long time and it was a smoking deal for a boss pedal at . the pedal works great with almost any guitar pickup set but sings with my emg powered schecter and tube amp .different distortion levels can be dialed in and to my surprise it works good with a bass although bass players know they will lose some bottom end .the guitar universe always raves about boss and the distortion pedals and how any guitar player should have one of the distortion pedals . buy it and experiment with the gain and settings and find your favorite tone .i may buy another one and mod it to use with my bass .in my opinion this is one of the finest pedals to exist . the crybaby is still on my pedalboard and will be for as long as i can foresee .nice reverb pedal got rid of my boss reverb . the tc pedals are all that is on byboard except my wah and a phase if they made these pedals i d probablybe all tc electronics ! what else can i say ! ! ! !
a must have tool to work on any car if your check or fixing electrical problems it makes the connecting and disconnecting that much easier and you don t have to break anything with this tool ! !this is one of the few well documented safe and reasonably effective products you can add to your gas tank that will not harm any part of your engine and perhaps help various issues depending on what your car needs . it is safe because it has been used for years in chevron gasoline . the highest concentration of it are in the premium grade . there have been lots of studies done on techron . the only difference between a bottle of this and the techron in the pump at the gas station is that the techron in this bottle is a much higher concentration . the reviewer who said that chevorn stations were disappearing did not know what he was talking about and as to his manual stating not to use additives that may or may not be the case but for techron since it is in pump gas it makes no sense this product would be included . it is designed to clean deposits in fuel injectors and carbs and to some degree help clean or prevent buildup of deposits on valves . it may nor may not increase mpg that is entirely dependent upon the issue you are having and how much a detergent added to your gas can clean . if your fuel injectors can have a better spray pattern then perhaps you could see minor increases in mpg . it is more likely to help an engine run and idle smoother and have power closer to what it was new if the fuel system has become inefficient due to becoming dirty with deposits . in many instances it can help clean deposits to an extent where there is a noticeable improvement in how your engine idles because it has helped to unclog your fuel injectors . again it certainly is one product that will not in any event harm your engine . it also will very likely help keep those deposits from becoming an issue in the first place if used on occasion . however this like any other gas additive can only do so much . it is reasonable to try using it before moving on to a more expensive repair but no gas additive can take the place of a mechanical cleaning or replacement or a fuel injector or repair of a damaged engine . so if you are going to use a cleaning fuel additive this is one of the best and the safest to try . just remember there is no engine rebuild in a can and the bulk of products such as oil additive mask serious wear issues at best . if you have relatively minor issues that could be helped by cleaning of the fuel delivery system this is one of the first easiest steps to take along with changing fuel filters and any other maintenance that your car may need such as replacing spark plugs . if this does not work there are machines at shops that are made for cleaning fuel injectors and related systems such as motovac which runs a cleaning fluid in a closed loop for a long period of time . that is a step up from adding something to your tank . if that fails than a mechanical remedy is needed . the only other two products i would consider using are made by redline and lucas . they make good products in general and have had good reviews on their fuel system cleaners . so feel safe trying this but don t expect miracles . proper engine maintenance is going to be your best and lowest cost way to avoid repairs and keep your car running like new more than any other thing you can do .works perfectly on engine and transmission oil drain plugs on all cars and most valve gaskets on imports . i use this stuff any where i can on the engine to prevent leaks happening .
i got this pedal cause is not so expensive and i love music . i used to play in big concerts but no more but i can tell you that for the price is good who ever wants to have some fun and learn how to use a pedal .i am editing my previous review on this little guitar after taking the time to properly set it up dial it in and play it for a while . i edited yet again as someone didn t appreciate my gloating over other guitars i own . sorry to offend you .i made a knee jerk review again right after i got this . but in all fairness i received my gibson les paul on the same day buying it from my local music store and professionally set up ready to go . i was comparing apples and oranges so to speak . but now even after comparing them to each other they really aren t that far apart .the gibson is the best guitar i ve ever owned and made my previous comparison based on it . but this little baby is now my second favorite .my other review was not fair ! ! ! ! ! ! i paid a lot more for the gibson and bucks for this epiphone . dollar for dollar this little ephiphone is a steal ! ! ! ! wow ! ! !i must honestly admit the edge goes to my gibson but not by as much as you d think . this little epiphone is an outstanding guitar regardless of price . if i were to play them each blindfolded i would never guess one was guitar ever ! the tone of the epiphone is much like the gibson les paul . it s easy to play comfortable and has a sweet sound . i can either rock out with it or mellow out and play the blues or classic rock .to be honest i will probably play this epiphone a lot more than the gibson . after all if i ding this one up i haven t broke the bank . i think i ll tend to use this one a lot more than the other .i am very happy with this epiphone les paul and will proudly play and own it . i am amazed they can make this thing for the money they charge . i may purchase another one and put it away as i m sure the price won t stay this low . plus i ll get another one in a different color ! ! you can never have too many guitars . . i am going to an a pickguard to this one . the finish on it is outstanding and i d like to keep it that way .if i were thinking of learning to play the guitar this one is a no brainer . . . .buy it ! ! !if you re an established player looking for a really nice practice guitar i d buy this one is a heartbeat . i was shocked at how sweet it sounds how good it looks how comfortable and light it is and how well it plays . sure it was way out of tune and required a few height adjustments but now it is fantastic .new rule for me no writing reviews until i own the product for at least one week ! ! ! ! !i love this tuner . it measures vibration with the option to switch to microphone . i find it really useful when trying to figure out what chord i want to play next . i can sing the note into it and then i know which chord i want to play next !

at least a couple decades ago i bought a panasonic electric pencil sharpener . it was black like this one but was a different model . mine was horizontal rather than vertical . in any case the panasonic sharpener been an excellent office appliance and i ve been very satisfied with it . the auto stop puts a perfect point on the pencil every time . i ve had no trouble at all . i hope these newer models work as well as my ancient one .gary petersoni ve owned the panasonic kp bk vertical electric pencil sharpener for about years now and i can attest that it s the most reliable sharpener out there . i m a teacher and i used this in my classroom where it got a big workout from all of my students . it held up well all this time which is probably the best testament to a superior product .i especially like the top loading feature here i ve found that electric sharpeners which are front loading are less efficient and take longer to sharpen pencils . i ve also used a boston front loading sharpener and it simply doesn t compare to the panasonic top loader .now about the price i have no clue why the amazon price here is so high for this sharpener . i paid under for the one i ve been using for the past ten years and i see them routinely advertised for not much more than that now between and . i would not suggest paying over for any pencil sharpener even one this good .highly recommended excellent product . check around for a better price .i purchased this item july th and finally got it today . when i put in a pencil nothing happened i tried other outlets which were both working and nothing . i should have listened to the other reviews and stayed away from what they called junk .x acto heavy duty electric pencil sharpener black unitupdate nov . th had replacement sharpener for months now works fine .
if you have a little one who likes to pick up his or her plate and drop it on the floor this plate is not for you . the plate can be easily picked up . plus the plate is too large and fits awkwardly on our highchair we have a boon high chair that we love love ! i do however really like the spoons . my son has more success and less mess with these spoons more than any other kind . . .for one thing the spoon bowl is quite rounded compared to some spoons that are only slightly rounded or even flat which is helpful as the child raises the spoon to the mouth the spoon may be tipped this way or that and the rounded bowl of the spoon helps to keep the contents on the spoon instead of falling back onto the plate . plus the shape of spoon handle and texture of the materials makes the spoon easier to grasp .i purchased this seat when my firstborn was a toddler . i m guessing he was around . years old .it came with pieces a base and a cup .the base has a wide stable bottom on it to prevent tipping and a nice back on it . there is rubber on the bottom to add stability and keep the potty from sliding across the floor . there are no sharp corners just curves which are very easy to keep clean . there is a hole in the base the cup is set into this hole overlapping the edges . the edges all slope towards the cup so any liquid drains into the cup .the deflector is not removable it is all one piece with the cup . i love this design . it is smooth so that it will not scratch tender body parts and it cannot get lost .the cup is removed from the top of the base ! with my other potty i had to turn it around and remove the cup from underneath the seat . if my toddler ever tried to empty it himself he ended up making a big mess . with this potty it was a lot easier for him to empty it without spilling .having the cup on top also means that he is sitting on the edges of the cup . there are no gaps or tight corners for pee to get into . the deflector could be a little higher in our experience but it wasn t too bad . i think if it was taller it might be annoying for a girl so i can understand why it is the height that it is .an added bonus is that this potty chair is not an eyesore . it s rounded corners and pleasing colours are easy to look at .while the design looked promising my month old was easily able to pick this plate up off a flat surface and dump its contents everywhere . the spoons are very ergonomic for a toddler but the bowls of the spoons are a bit large for their small mouths . the cloverleaf design does appear to assist her in getting food onto the spoon rather than chasing it all over the plate . overall i d say this plate is nice but over priced .
these are a good accessory to have because the clips are decent quality and the varied colors are helpful in keeping track of all the wires .please note these are not white but beige . . . other than that they are standard rv baggage catchesthese are light duty jumpers but will work for occasional use . there are times when the voltmeter needs to be connected and you cannot hold the leads . these are fine for that .
it does what it is supposed to do that is to increase placement distance from the car to the electrical outletthe rd generation powerprobe includes a number of changes for additional flexibility . in short it is a vehicle powered dvm with both a foot cable and an additional foot extension giving you a foot working range around either the battery terminals or cigarette lighter outlet both clips and a plug are included in the kit .with the series units they use a hard gold plated banana jack to hold the removable probe or cables to extend your reach . if you purchase the accessory kit it includes piercing probes that self center on a conductor pierce the insulation and attach to the jack allowing you to tap a wire at any point to locate intermittant problems .while the dvm is backlit all the time it also has bright white leds facing forward to aid in finding and probing terminals in dark places . the actual probe is hardgold plated with a sharp tip and removable at the banana jack . another identical probe is included with a screw in female banana jack in the accessories kit to retrofit the powerprobe i and ii units to accept external cables and probes .if you need to excite a circuit with a connection to battery ground or to battery positive the switch allows a momentary connection to bridge the probe tip to either voltage which is useful in testing relay driven circuits indicator lights and other small current loads . the prope voltage is always displayed during testing on the meter . the voltage ground switch is circuit breaker protected in case you accidentally drive volts into a chassis ground . additionally since the switch takes abuse it is easily replaced if it fails with just a screwdriver .combined with the testlead set the powerprobe greatly simplifies testing of vehicular wire and big rigs up to a single trailer . the dvm has selectable modes of operation designed for different problems . reading the manual is important to get the full value from this meter .although the price is a little high the design and construction quality are excellent . enough wire is provided to check running lights on trailers or to look for blown fuses . all of the wiring is exceptionally flexible and heavily insulated with top quality connectors . both the tester and accessories come in hard plastic cases that can be stowed in a service box .not mentioned in specifications is that although the probe runs from vdc the meter can be used to measure voltages up to vdc .i used this controller to replace the horrible factory dodge controller in my ram . this controller is worlds ahead of the factory controller in terms of features and available settings . if you are hauling a large trailer it is a must have . the boost function is a great feature that applies the trailer brakes ahead of the truck brakes . you can set boost to levels to meet your desired brake feel . my fiver weighs around lbs more than my truck and between this controller and the exhaust brake stopping is effortless .
i use this often to record my band s gigs . now if they would make one that will hold a par can so i can turn my extra mic stands into single can lighting racks !once i read about the bugera b i knew i wanted one . why futz with tube like effects when you can have real live tubes two in fact ! only five watts yes but that s still enough to fill a room . but it s the extras that cinch the deal this is built like a brick house you can jump up and down on it if you want to . it has an internal cable for the speaker so you can easily plug in a different cabinet . comes with built in reverb . headphone jack standard . best of all an attenuator so you can get the cranked sound even at low volume levels . easily upgradeable i put new tubes and speaker into mine though i probably didn t have to . a small but effective little amp .edit i had modded my bugera with a jensen mod and used it for bass but recently i found a source for celestion super drivers and popped one of those in . amazing low end output for such a small cab !this little stand serves so many purposes for me . .at home it is a keyboard stand and even a stand to put my pedalboard on when i want to test out different pedal configurations .at my gig it holds my presonus mixer a laptop and all of my wireless transmitters and receivers . . it is so versatile because it can be narrow or wide and short or tall . .as well i have the onstage connector that will allow you to connect a mic boom to it . . i plan on using this one day to hold my ableton live machine as well as a small octave keyboard and i will use the mic boom arm at that point ! even as a keyboard stand i like it because i can put pedals underneath it . . with it fully extended to long mode i can fit both my pedal train pro and mini underneath it . . of course that is solid inches of stage front though . . which is indeed a lot for the small places i fit into with my duo . .
works as advertised . the labels do warp a bit with age but this does not affect how they print or attach .does what it does and has what it said .works good so far .buy it when you can have compatible staplersit met all my expectations and does what it is supposed to do . easy to operate when put to the task .
i didn t understand the sizing of wolf as being a medium bone . my dogs need large bones but they love it anyway . it just won t last as long .although i ve been buying nylabones for my dogs for many years i only recently realized that amazon carried them for a better price than petco or petsmart so i now order all our nylabones strictly from here . nylabones help curb destructive chewing ease boredom and clean teeth .like any toy nylabones carry a risk if not used properly . there is no such thing a completely safe toy .with that said i ve never had a problem with nylabones nor do i know anyone who has . it s all about being responsible and knowing your dog . when it all comes down to it they can be quite child like . they need you to use your head . make sure you re buying the appropriate size for your dog . don t buy one that s too small simply because it s cheaper . if you re using a bone that s too small it will greatly increase the chance of your dog biting off pieces that can be harmful .if your dog is an aggressive chewer then don t leave them alone for extended periods with any toy . nylabones included .be safe and smart ! ! your dogs depend on you !i don t really know how the solar snowflakes are until next christmas . the nala bone has sharp edges when my dog chews it . he is a pittbull lab so he really chews . i would like to find a bone that he won t destroy . please let me know if you have anything like that .
this works great for my fish fry tanks . it lets me keep my hang off the back filters without having to worry that the filter will suck up any of the babies in the tank .if you are tired of carrying buckets back and forth the fish tank this one is for you . it attaches to your faucet and you can siphon and fill the tank . i use this on the laundry faucet which i needed to buy the additional brass adapter . it allows me to leave one piece connected to the faucet and the other to the plastic connector . then when i need to use it it snaps in place to the faucet and it is easy to remove .was looking for something to go in my tank and fill it with bubbles . i put this in a six gallon round tank . it works wonderful . it sits under the decorations and fills them with bubbles which all come out a hole in the roof of the building in the bottom . this is a great way to get some bubbles in your tank .
this monitor is great . i really like the features that it offers . not only does it have lights that light up when baby cries it can also vibrate if you have that option turned on when baby cries so you ll know even while running the vacuum . i like how the battery on the parents unit is rechargeable all you have to do is plug it in . this monitor picks of up every sound which is great to have with a little one .the fisher price sounds n lights monitor offers some good qualities that make it a worthwhile addition to the household with infants and young toddlers . its best feature is its ability to pick up and transmit even the slightest sounds . any slight noise in the babies room like a slight cough or even a deep breath is detected by the transmitter and sent to the receiver . depending on how loud the volume is turned up concerned parents will be able to hear these and other sounds with ease .sounds are most important but the fisher price sounds n lights monitor also offers lights to let parents know about the activities taking place . the lights indicate the intensity of the noise and they work even if the volume is turned completely off . the arcs of red light on the fisher price sounds n lights monitor include four arcs and they light up based on the intensity of the noise . they aren t absolutely necessary but they are good for those who would rather monitor with their eyes as opposed to ears .does the fisher price sounds n lights monitor have any drawbacks ? yes it certainly does and the most annoying among them is the static . no matter how little activity is going on within the vicinity of the transmitter you still get static and it is especially loud if the volume control is turned too high . sometimes you can reposition the receiver and or transmitter of the fisher price sounds n lights monitor and reduce the static . changing the channel can also help . but you can t do much with the antennae and there is almost no way to get completely static free reception .another potential problem with this monitor is its ability to sometimes pickup the sounds from other people in the neighborhood . if someone else is using a baby monitor or even if they are just talking on the phone the fisher price sounds n lights monitor might end up receiving some of the sounds . this can be quite shocking when it happens the first time . you will think there is someone in your babies room when in reality the sounds are coming from the neighbors .taken as a whole however the fisher price sounds n lights monitor is a good monitor for new parents and while it doesn t offer anything special it gets the job done for minimal cost . there are certainly better monitors out there but this monitor completes its task without doing too much damage to the pocketbook .simple without lights and music that can be too much stimulation in a bed . i got this for my grandaughter who had vision problems . it immediately attracted her gaze and continues to do so . it allows changing height by removing links as vision range increases . cost is very reasonable .
this is a leather spray that does help keep the leather soft and looking nice . it is not a heavy duty cleaner thus if your leather is in really poor condition like one of my chair covers this spray will not do the job . this works well on my auto seats and does give a good shine and soft feeling . i like the product . it is easily applied . do not apply if the leather is really hot after sitting in the driveway as it gets sticky . i should have known better .armor all is a miracle worker for tired dried old upholstery . it cleans seals protects covers scratches and makes leather and vinyl look new again . i ve been using it since the early s and highly recommend it . i use it on the seats dash inner doors and even on the tire sidewalls . i ve also used it on leather and vinyl purses an office chair and leather book covers .just spray let it soak in then wipe it off well . if you buff it it doesn t leave an oily residue or any odor . don t use it on any place that would be a slipping hazard like floors because it does leave a slippery finish .try armor all and you ll be amazed at how great your car seats can look !i don t know why wranglers don t come with some kind of door sill protection but these are inexpensive and easy enough to apply .look great appear to be durable and have no odd edges to snag .
these are perfect for shipping items such as clothes shoes diapers etc . these will fit large pairs of jeans sweaters and even women s jackets . they are very tough and do not rip easily and i find that the sticky closure sticks very well ! will purchase again !these are very thick plastic pocket dividers and they come in several bright opaque colors .features insert able label tabs diagonal pockets on each side three holes to fit bindersi had been looking for a folder with multiple pockets to carry the various papers i need for work and i found these and put several of them in a binder with velcro pocket and ta da i have a wonderfully organized clearly labeled and easy to use work kit . my favorite part about them is how incredibly durable they are . i m confident i ll be able to lug my binder around in the field and the pockets will probably last longer than the binder itself .i really like these tab dividers . i think it s really great to be able to buy multiple sets in single purchase . this listing comes with sets of tab dividers . each set has tabs . i buy some many of these for my kids for school so i like this option of being able to purchase in bulk .these tabs are a bit different in the sense that your titles for each tab isn t actually on each tab . it s printed off on a standard sheet of paper that is inserted into an included protective sleeve that goes into the back of your binder . the tabs are transparent so you are just reading the titles through the actual tab . it s different but nice . it s really easy to create and print these out . you can simply go to the wilson jones website and input your info there to print out or you can follow the easy to follow directions included with this set to do this in microsoft word or wordperfect . not only can you print out the title page for your tabs but you can also print out a table of contents that goes in the front of your binder behind the included protective cover .these dividers work great in any size binder . the title pager holder has a section that unfolds when you are using binders greater than . this makes the titles extend further so you can read them at all times regardless of the binder size . this is a really helpful feature .i find this to be a very durable set that you should be able to use over and over . especially since you can reprint the tab titles or table of contents at any given time .the tabs are described as square but they are still rounded at the edge as you can see in the pictures . i like the size and shape .i really like this pack of tab dividers and i would highly recommend them .
it is hard to find a printer that lists windows server as a compatible operating system . i tried some other brand printers and the drivers would refuse to install . even though canon support told me that this printer is not officially supported for server i installed the drivers anyway and it works perfect !dymo s website has a software download for intel power macs this software does not work at all even though the mac sees the dymo sitting on a usb port it cannot print to it after a friendly geek struggled with it for the better part of a hour it finally decided to print labels even the geek does not know what he did to make it print so if it goes down it goes to my physical trash bin get with it dymo macs are taking over the computer worldi ve been using a dymo labelwriter twin turbo for about three years . i accidentally plugged in the wrong type of ac adapter into my usb hub and poof my printer blew out . so i ordered a new one . i can tell you that for a small home office environment and postage printing this printer will do the trick . the latest software synchronizes with your outlook contacts so it is easy breezy to create address labels for those who are in your outlook address book .i just received my replacement and there s a problem with the installation at least for windows . the disk that comes with the printer installs the software addressing stamps but does not install the driver . if you buy this printer and are running windows here s what you need to do go to dymo s website . . . and click on support drivers downloads . from here you can download the latest software and drivers and you ll be good to go . if this is a first time installation don t plug in the usb printer cable until prompted to do so by the software download .so aside from the installation problem this is a printer you can count on for the long haul provided you don t do something stupid like i did and blow it out with an incorrect ac adapter . lol !
these work great for the evenflo bottles . affordable and they fit well so the bottles vent but don t leak . my daughter had no issues with these nipples .these discs work well with avent products . they also fit in my lansinoh bottles .these fit both my medela spectra dew pumps . my medela is ancient at least a decade old but the newer pump parts still fit it so these go from the standard bottle size to fit the avent bottles .i have both the super wide nipple avent bottles as well as the classic size and these adapters fit fine .i also have the avent via storage system and the wider converter fits those just fine as well .i don t know what the other reviews mean about leaking . . . . i put the bottle caps on that come with the bottles tops that fit the storage containers on as soon as i m done pumping . if my milk is nearing the top of the bottle container while pumping i switch out bottles . but while pumping i ve experienced no leakage .
avery wasn t kidding when they named these business cards clean edge . they really break off with clean edges and it s so easy too . the quality of the paper is superb and i printed with an ordinary inkjet printer and there were no smears or streaks . the sheet will tell you how to load in the paper and how to break off the cards . they also include instructions on how to download free software from avery and the website also has a lot of templates for business cards and other projects . avery is really awesome for business and creative needs !the text is crisp and the graphics is crisp . . . i can t ask for more . . . maybe just that the printer can include the page toner instead of the one . . . but oh well .if you have paper jam all the time it could be due to the orange thingy in the paper tray . . . . i don t know why but i don t see any paper in the package saying that the orange thingy should be removed . so i had paper jam all the time . after i suspect that the orange things are all supposed to be pulled out then i removed it and then no more paper jam any more !this avery greeting card paper works great for me . i never had it jam up my printer maybe its because i separate all the pages first to see if any are stuck together . then re stack how may i want to print put paper in printer and print away . my cards turn out very well i will buy this paper again .
the listing for this item can be confusing if you are not sure what stereo xlr is . stereo xlr is meant to be similar to your stereo headphones where left and right are separate unbalanced wires . this cable is configured to be a stereo unbalanced xlr to a stereo unbalanced trs cable . this item is not a mono balanced xlr to a stereo unbalanced mic cable .a little bit a soldering can fix this connector by moving the red wire from ping to pin with the white wire . pin then ties to pin with the ground wire .we have used them for three shows and a bunch of practices . sounds great looks great the cable tie straps are nice and the connectors fit into the microphone nice and tight . even fixed another bands vox mic connector his sure cable was loose in the connector this cable was tight . has worked on . . .sm nady starpower akg s mxl marshall and mark bass amps and every one had a nice tight clean connection on the xlr s and on the numerous mixers . and yes color rules !using this as a line from my amp to a single pedal . works great no noise . well made cable with bullet proof molded ts protection . the cable is slightly on the thin side but it functions well . without a doubt a very sturdy cable .
 . . .but it works fine for me .i used to connect a orange micro terror head amporange amplifiers micro terror mt w hybrid guitar amp head standard to a cabinet ppc orange ppc x speaker cabinetthis mic stand will work great for mic ing full stacks and guitar amps .some people have mentioned the counterweight could be heavier but they need to pay attention to how they are orienting the feet in relation to the microphone . you should make sure one of the feet is pointing in the exact same direction as the microphone arm so that way the downward force is applied directly onto the support leg .each bx d speaker has its own amp onboard and power supply . want a channel system buy speakers and run xlr audio to each one . no noise or hum . has both trs and xlr inputs has a knob for gain control on back . most importantly each speaker has an iec connector for power to just that speaker . mine sit left and right of my mixing panel using trs outputs which copy the xlrs those go to my marantz pmd digital recorder w gb of datacard memory onboard and a nice set of vu meters . speakers include a foam stick on bottom to prevent buzzing against hard surfaces . there is however no mounting point no captive nuts or such .you ll need to adopt a philosophy on gain . you can crank the speaker gain to and use your mixer to set the levels but ensure that your recorder gets enough signal to be in the to db range . it may be a tad loud in that case you may want to set both speakers to their oclock position which is power approximately .you could alternately use the mixer to run near db and turn it way down on the speakers . i like to use mine to listen to talk shows before falling asleep at night so i turn the volume way down but drive them with db off the mixer .having a separate power supply and amp for each speaker makes for some great isolation .my first nitpick is there is no grill cover on these like other maudio products have . i will have to fabricate some protection . my second nitpick is i owned the smaller m audio monitors where the amps were in the left speaker and the right speaker connected with twin lead speaker wire to the left i .e . not true bi amping but smaller spkrs for my mixer . the speaker w amps died at mos after buying it . it was not the power supply as being on made the box warm but the led surround around the vol knob would not light and you could barely hear the audio even with db into the trs line in . thats a different cheaper model by maudio but i had to trash it and buy these which are much nicer !i do like this set of speakers . from stereo to . surround they do the job with differential audio inputs . i may get more for ch as i have a sub already .
if you want an eq pedal right away to tweak guitar keyboard sounds this think is great . people are trying to hate on this but it is fine i was expecting the worst from the reviews but still wanted it so i got it anyway . you don t need the adapter they push the behringer brand v best way to work with this is turn all bands all the way down then just go up with each one till you get the guitar sound you like then you can turn it off during this test to go back to your default normal sound to hear the difference . it works nicely and for the price it was a steal . in the future i may get a more expensive one this seems fine for now .this is not a gigging pedal . you do not have time to tune with this pedal at a gig so if you re planning on gigging in the next month or so spend the on a korg . however if you re an at home player who just wants to not have to mess around with regular electric tuners this is worth the price . it sits right on the pedal board the signal flies through it when it s off so there s no monkeying with your cables everytime you want to switch between standard and drop d and it s as accurate as the korg is . it s just also slow . it takes a good seconds to register a change which is fine when you re just practicing or even for recording at home where a few seconds aren t crucial . i just recommend something a little faster if you need to tune quickly between songs .so heres the thing that no one else wants to say . the thing is built like a piece of s . it jingles and rattles and parts are always moving around . i used this times and it shorted out . the lights started flashing and it got hot . i called line and they determined it was bad so they opened a ticket . fyi if you want to deal with the worst customer service in the industry just call line . not only do they not know what they were talking about but in the backgrounc i could hear them lauging and joking like there was a big party going on . i wish i would have never bought this but hopefully i get a new one soon . well see how helpful they really are .
these work fine no cracking they come in a nice assortment of colors and they re easy to see when they get dropped .this is my second case from them . build good for carry and balance . brass color lock that comes with it .i bought this harmonica to go with my guitar and add a little extra music . this was a very nice harmonica and comes with a nice case as well .
wonderfull gate ! it swings in both directions . it is extra tall . you dont have to mount it on to your walls . it comes with two extensions and i have used it with both extensions on it and it dosent give at all . our house has odd openings and i can fit this anywhere . i still have a plastic gate in my kitchen and just came online to order a second one of these to replace that .good news for parents of curious toddlers . the way to open it is a button on the top of the gate since this is an extra tall gate you d have to be the parent of a future nba player to get to it . even if you have a super tall todler you have to push the button over and lift the swing gate to open it . . . it is very easy for most adults however visitors will have problems with it ! ! !also if you need extensions for a gate you need to check the price of extensions . . . i needed both extensions and by the time i added them onto other gates i would have paid . or more . that is the reason i chose this one .this is the second kidco product i have purchased . let me start by saying that their products are some of the safest out there and i have every confidence in the security of the gates i have installed . but the first gate i purchased was the standard gateway that uses hardware to install . you can see my review there but the thing that is pertinent here is that they only included limited hardware in the box which would not work safely if installing the gate into dry wall even when there is a stud . so instead of including another set of screws that would ve cost them about . kidco likes to make busy parents go buy that stuff themselves .well this gate has its own torturous surprise for busy parents who are trying to multitask every hour of the day . kidco kindly includes two extensions making this gate much more versitile than most on the market . the thing they don t tell you is that these extensions are held in by the same tension that holds the gate into the wall . each of these tension screws are completely separate from one another which is good design because it allows installation over uneaven surfaces . however because there is no mechanism holding these extensions into place this means that the parent installing the gate must use two hands to hold up the gate make sure each of the separate extension brackets and two separate support bars and the metal extension bars which the brackets slide over none of which lockinto place in anyway don t fall off all the while trying to tighten one tension screw at a time . . . i cannot even explain to you how two limbs are not enough to get the job done and still remain sane by the end of the process .throw me a bone kidco ! how about the brackets clip or screw that holds the brackets into place so they don t slide off while i m trying to mount the gate ? something ! ? !unfortunately you will find that kidco often makes the best products for this kind of thing but they sure do cut corners on the little stuff that would make a parent s life a lot easier .this gate is really a great product . i love the fact that you don t have to hardware mount the gate no drilling into the doorways required and it s still very sturdy . it was incredibly easy to install and is very safe and secure . my month son knows how the gate opens but cannot open it because of the weight required to push down on the lever . the only negatives i encountered were the first hands free gate i purchased was not painted properly so i had to return it for another one . i had to buy the quot gate extension for the gate to fit in the doorway . so in the end there are additional costs if the opening you intend to use the gate for is not that narrow . but all in all it s totally worth it .
i have a parakeet cockatiel and a small parrot and the cockatiel size works for all three birds they all like these nutriberries a lotwhile i can t yet review how much my bird likes or dislikes the product she s still weaning i can at least review the product itself .the rope is tightly wound giving it a lot of support . the two connectors were very nicely designed and fit my bar spaced cage perfectly . the large perch was just long enough to make a nice loop in my cage and is thick enough for an african grey to sit on comfortably . the packaging seems to imply macaws but i personally find it too small for their feet and may even buckle a bit under their weight .either way it is well constructed and well designed in the regard to attaching to a cage . i think this can add some fun and exciting new perch designs in a cage allowing our birdies to climb and enjoy the different texture assuming they don t decide its a chew toy .works just as i thought . it s sturdy and looks nice . this can be used for almost any bird or small animal cage . it s a nice shelf they can sit on .
this device is a converter that works with rca inputs and outputs . the input seems to be geared for the db range for consumer level audio range . this box also has the ability to monitor the input directly with headphones .very versatile power supply and much cheaper than others . this is not true isolated outputs but it is quiet and that is what counts . i have the fuel tank chameleon and i end up using this because it fits the needs of the pedals on my board the best mainly because of the ma output . here is a comparison of the jp chameleon and the onespot . i have all three .t rex fuel tank chameleon ma outputs v v maoutput v v maoutput v v ma use or only not bothoutput v ac majoyo sp ma outputs v maoutput dc v maximum output of maoutput dc v maoutput dc v mavisual sound onespot ma v only daisy chain power into pedals not exceeding mayou know the problem with v wall warts is that noise in the signal can be a problem . i am powering my unit pedal board with this adapter and it works great . i have used it some at lower voltages but only on my older analog pedals . i wouldn t reccomend running digital effects at reduced voltage . the cord is a little wimpy compared to my boss psa adapter but it is acceptable .
the size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous . the funnel is long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only long . it states that the funnel is x but in reality the opening for the funnel is in diameter at the widest point .it would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless .this works exactly as you expect . if your gap is too small you can just slightly tilt the entire gauge while measuring the gap and the gap will extend some . . . that is measure push to extend re measure and repeat until you have the right gap .you can also use the inside of the small ring area to expand the gap . this is where i think the tool could improve . the small edge of the wedge on the inner ring could be smaller . once i happened to tap my gap too small to fit on that wedge and had some trouble getting the gap to open back up enough to again work on the gauge .all in all though this is a necessity in my motorcycle tool bag .just opened my mail and a . inch long air hammer bit is what i measured . not the . inch as the ad says on amazon .com . hope it still works out ok . i wanted longer one that would reach into the hollow van sliding door as well as the hollow rear side panel . it s a nickle coin size and flat on the impact end . i was looking for a arched shape but this will do ?
i don t use it for any heavy use . i use it for podcasting purposes . haven t had any problems . so i can t speak to really heavy use of the product .i know when i ordered it i was buying a cheap device and didn t expect it to be great . it works . that should be enough but amazon requires a certain number of words .a very recent purchase . . . .i have not used it yet so i can t say much . . .however i have loaded the software on my laptop . . .the software has soooo many capabilities its about mind boggling . . . . .very good deal for newbies like me ! ! !
very quick and easy mounting and really adds to the look of the rear of the jeep . these are metal and not a cheap plastic and mount with included screws into the existing lens cover screw holes .i decided to try these out and i m glad i did ! the black ones look really god in combination with the carbon fiber license plate frame i also got from amazon real carbon fiber license plate frame tag cover ffsince most plates only use two screws one set covers front and rear if you are lucky enough to live where a front plate is required the white ring mounts like a washer under your mounting screws and the black cap just snaps over the top . seems to hold well enough to not fall off but they pull of easily if you have to get to your screws . another reviewer mentioned that they trap water in and rusted his mounting hardware . that is good to know . i would suggest going with stainless steel mounting hardware just in case . which isn t a bad idea anyway it bothers me when front license plate is screwed directly to the bumper . considering the cost of these mounting brackets i wish manufacturers included them as standard equipment it would show their attention to detail .when i found cruiser accessories mounting plate it seemed like a good value . i especially liked multiple slots for mounting onto the bumper . these slots provide a good number of mounting and adjustment options . i used the upper two vertical slots because they were spaced exactly like the existing holes in my car s front bumper .unfortunately there was a couple of frustrating issues that spoiled the experience . four screws that are included with the plate are too long . i saw them being long and i am glad i checked for this before installing the mounting plate onto the front bumper . i used included four screws to attach the license plate and the black cruiser accessories classic lite frame to the mounting plate screws sharp tips protruded from the back of the mounting plate . if i had installed the mounting plate onto the bumper first and then tried to attach the license plate with the included screws i would have damaged the front bumper in two places the bottom two holes ended up over an air intake slot on my car . i expect all pieces included with the product to be carefully engineered for that product and working properly . these screws obviously are of the wrong size . the fact that i had to go to home depot to find properly fitting screws not only was frustrating but also increased the overall cost . . the thin pieces of plastic at the top and bottom of the mounting plate are too flimsy . when i unpacked the plate these areas of the mounting plate were slightly deformed bent inwards . fortunately the license plate covered the problem .when the mounting plate is installed it looks nice so i am not completely disappointed however i found a similar product from bell at autozone and it was cheaper though bell s mounting plate had very long screws too .
rear facing position will require inches or more depending on how your backseats are made from the backseat to the front seat in order to get it level . if you have bench seats in front less than that distance forget it . it doesn t recline enough to act as an infant bed but as of this writing you may put a rolled up towel under the front of the base in order to further level it out . double check that before you do it as things change . i have a minivan and the top of the carseat still pokes out between the two front bucket seats and they both had to be moved forward to accomodate especially the passenger side .that being said my baby has been riding in this seat since day . at less than lbs she was strapped in very securely . and even though my minivan doesn t have the latch system the latch straps could be utilized in even my van to further secure it . example being my lb cousin who even flailed about in it and it wouldn t budge . it is not that hard to install as long as you read the instructions .if youre baby is small and even mine at inches and less than lbs was small for it bring rolled up blankets to cushion the side in order to keep their back and head aligned . the infant insert doesn t quite go down far enough to really secure an infant s head from bobbing around a little . of course don t cushion the seat itself by law your baby s back has to be in contact with the seat cover itself and even at that small they honestly don t need it .my child is now over months old and lbs and the extra cushioning isn t necessary . i use it for long journeys now just as an extra swaddle comfort to her . the point belt gives me peace of mind and it s a snap to get her in and out of it a lot easier than some others i ve seen and tried .so yes it takes a lot of space but then considering the cost for the length of use who cares ? it s rough tough the dark covers hide spot really nicely until you can wash it . i dunno how many parents i made jealous when they realized it had a cupholder too that can be removed while your child is still too young to use such a thing . she s safe its not budging even a little that s all any parent can really ask of these things anyway right ?my only beef is although the seat cover quot seems quot at first to be a breeze to take off to wash . . . it isn t .this booster seat folds up compactly for travel and is easy to bring along . you can pull the straps through the handle to make a shoulder strap . it is definitely for older babies . i prefer to use it in a chair that has arm rests so that my baby can t topple off to the side . my ten month old sits in it and eats fine but his weight can easily shift . i would not leave a child unattended for even a second in this booster because i think they could be seriously hurt if they leaned over too far . the fabric on the side provides no support . it is merely funcntional for holding the seat back at the correct angle . however i just wanted something that would be easier than holding the baby on my lap . this meets that criteria and was the right price for infrequent use . the patterned fabric on the seat looks better in person but it doesn t really match the other blue periwinkle fabric . i followed the instructions to allow the seat to expand overnight and after that it inflated and deflated easily . overall i am satisfied with this purchase .this seat is much better than the quot multi use bathing cushion quot . it s a lot easier to pull baby out of the tub at a higher height sitting comfortably as opposed to being on your knees . you can adjust the height and there s no strain on your back or knees ! it s a bit bulky in our small bathroom but it s worth it .
the extra long cable is wonderful for my neighbor since she s been physically less able to take her dog outside . with this cable staked into the ground she can just clip it to the collar and let the dog roam safely in her patio .will only pump air about inches under water then the pressure becomes too much .batteries are loose so if you shake it it will turn on and off .very short power feet max if not feet cord makes it obnoxious to set up on a fish tank . has a clip on the back that will not fit on anything you d have on our around your aquarium so difficult to mount or put anywhere .it does what it is supposed to do though which is turn on when the power goes out . i have mine so the tube is inch under water so itll break surface tension in the case of power outage . very cheaply does what it says it will .the specifications state x . x . inches . with the wheels it measures . in height . of course it will not slide into my pantry at that height .now i either place it outside in an unsightly plain view position or drag it in and out of the pantry . i will bet in a few months that the unit breaks after pushing and pulling since the plastic is sort of brittle . the corners of the wheels are flimsy and not engineered well enough for the added stress of daily maneuvering where the wheels attach to the unit .seriously pass this if you are on the bubble of a decision .
as title states purchased for my wifes nissan rogue . can never be prepared enough when it comes to families and the vehicles we drive . opened up package and turned on car plugged it in to make sure it works . bam . . . does just what it was intended to do .this product does not fit your toyota tacoma ! that s according to amazon .yes it does fit my toyota tacoma access cab .i don t know what that white powder is on the rubber seal but i cleaned it before installing the cap . no error codes and no gas stolen so far .first of all this was shipped in its original sales box all taped up and that is it . was shocked to see the poor excuse of shipping method but i guess you really cannot break this thing simply by shipping it .installed on a k lb travel trailer works pretty good but did not elliminate all the sway . part of it is because i am towing with a large suv that is really a little small framed for towing this size camper even though the rv dealers will say it is a perfect fit as does the tow vehicle manujfacturer .sold the suv and bought a big boy truck to tow with and what a difference . i don t even need this anymore as the bigger tow vehicle makes all the difference .btw do not back up with this connected to the tow vehicle and trailer you will bend it faster that you installed it .
we like that this tub is large enough to bathe a toddler in . it can be used for both babies and those that are old enough to sit up on their owni love how easy this is to use ! folds up travels well cleans easily fits my kid well is secure and is on the third kid so they last . i will keep it always to have something for friends to use when visiting . only complaint is that it doesn t recline so a baby can t sit at the table until the are strong enough to almost sit up .my baby already stands up so this gets on his way when he awakes up in the crib . the item is nicely made but i would only use it on younger babies .
it s very helpful to hold my lamp just above the tank . adjustable and just great . very stable and you can slide the platform right under the tank so it can t move .nice heating mat . holds temperature well without making hot spots . the adhesive isn t all that great though so you might want to put a towel under your tank . this will keep the heating mat in contact with the tank and will insulate the tank directing heat into the tank instead of the stand .one of my neon tetra jumped out of the tank a few days before the cover arrived . take no effort to place it on my l aquarium . the extended plastic can be used if you want to cover the tank completely . plastic can be trimmed to fit the filter and wires . made a mistake and glue the plastic handle that the lettering is reversed .
i purchased this item thinking it was bpa and phthalate free but it is not . it s never a good sign when there isn t even a recycling symbol on the item . we re trying to be as plastic free as possible so i returned it same day and plan to buy the eurobath as a replacement . i will say that diapers .com was exceptionally nice with the return . they provided a prepaid shipping label within minutes of my phone call to customer service .i have used avent nipples for all of my kids . they are a great product at a great price on amazon especially if you can get the free shipping !as you can see in the picture the bottles are supposed to be clear and not the bpa free ones . i ordered these because i wanted the ones that are not bpa free . i wanted them to be completly clear . when i recieved them i was sad to see that they were the bpa free kind . if i wanted the bpa free ones i would have order them for cheaper per pack . .needless to say i am getting a refund . but apparently dr . browns doesnt make the clear non bpa free ones anymore so i suppose i will have to get the bpa free kind but at least i will be getting them cheaper then this .
does a super job on brass copper silver aluminum bronze and stainless steel . polishes most metals to a mirror like finish . i ve been using this polish for many years and would definitely recommend it .does a super job on brass copper silver aluminum bronze and stainless steel . polishes most metals to a mirror like finish . very similar to flitz polishing cream .these are typical hard plastic handles contoured for grip . the stock bar is substantial at . edges are finished nicely . the metal shaft is unpolished and has a finish to prevent slippage .i don t care if all my hand tools are the same color if it matters to you then note these may come in a different color than illustrate see my pics .made in the u .s .a . nice .j
the rd generation powerprobe includes a number of changes for additional flexibility . in short it is a vehicle powered dvm with both a foot cable and an additional foot extension giving you a foot working range around either the battery terminals or cigarette lighter outlet both clips and a plug are included in the kit .with the series units they use a hard gold plated banana jack to hold the removable probe or cables to extend your reach . if you purchase the accessory kit it includes piercing probes that self center on a conductor pierce the insulation and attach to the jack allowing you to tap a wire at any point to locate intermittant problems .while the dvm is backlit all the time it also has bright white leds facing forward to aid in finding and probing terminals in dark places . the actual probe is hardgold plated with a sharp tip and removable at the banana jack . another identical probe is included with a screw in female banana jack in the accessories kit to retrofit the powerprobe i and ii units to accept external cables and probes .if you need to excite a circuit with a connection to battery ground or to battery positive the switch allows a momentary connection to bridge the probe tip to either voltage which is useful in testing relay driven circuits indicator lights and other small current loads . the prope voltage is always displayed during testing on the meter . the voltage ground switch is circuit breaker protected in case you accidentally drive volts into a chassis ground . additionally since the switch takes abuse it is easily replaced if it fails with just a screwdriver .combined with the testlead set the powerprobe greatly simplifies testing of vehicular wire and big rigs up to a single trailer . the dvm has selectable modes of operation designed for different problems . reading the manual is important to get the full value from this meter .although the price is a little high the design and construction quality are excellent . enough wire is provided to check running lights on trailers or to look for blown fuses . all of the wiring is exceptionally flexible and heavily insulated with top quality connectors . both the tester and accessories come in hard plastic cases that can be stowed in a service box .not mentioned in specifications is that although the probe runs from vdc the meter can be used to measure voltages up to vdc .the ones i received are not identical to the picture . one can only be installed on the side and the other can only be installed on the front or back . the markings are different for left to right level vs front to back level .easy to replace . it lacks toyota instructions but it is exactly like existing toyota part with all wires colored the same way so it is very obvious how to connect those .the original part has a silicone rubber tube going all the way from top to bottom with wires running inside it . this part only provides a short length of tubing that at best would cover half of the length of wires on my car .i thing they should provide a telescoping tubing of two diameters with one going inside of the other while you are crimping wires and then extended to cover the full length of wires
apple threw a curve at me when with the new thin imac the company eliminated not only the superdrive but the . mm audio in port that had been highly useful on previous models especially for recording computer sounds with a single patch cord . after trying a griffin and logitech device i finally found a useful workaround with the behringer ufo interface there are other very similar models by behringer the uca and the uca . what sets these interfaces apart from the usb is a smaller footprint and a permanently attached dedicated usb cord . simply by plugging the usb cord into the usb port on my imac i was able to record all of the broadcasts tapes and lps just as i had done with my old imac though monitoring required more cords in back ugh ! .for a committed neophyte like me the ufo was probably sufficient . i miss the permanently attached usb out cable and moreover am questioning whether i ll ever use the mixing capabilities of the usb which to my eyes has a bit of a learning curve . the problem for the impatient beginner begins with the instruction manual . instead of separate sections the manual uses small thin font and mixes english with spanish instructions a minor but unnecessary inconvenience . but give behringer credit for providing a manual ! i thought i was investing in more versatility for a modest price increase than what the behringer ufo uca line of interfaces offered me . but a friend tells me that garageband has the capability of recording sound on sound . my present programs sound studio and toast can t do it but if gb can layer or more sound sources then the question becomes whether an external mixer does it better . if not the behringer ufo is not only adequate to serve my needs but its tiny footprint makes it especially welcome on a new imac s desk space apple s elimination of the internal burner gives the company thin screen bragging rights while robbing the user of both money and space thanks to the new requirement of an external burner .behringer has presented the best solution i ve been able to find to apple s surprising and dubious omissions with the latest imac . if your uses include mixing and if you have the space we re talking a mere inch or two the usb is no doubt worth an extra ten bucks . but if you have a ufo or uca interface your needs may already be covered .if you want to use this to power up a tascam dr series digital recorder i have a less expensive solution for you if you own a usb wall charger like a cell phone charger you can use that to power your device through its usb port . that s a lot cheaper than spending twenty something dollars on an additional wall wart ! later the mic is indeed the behringer c but amazon has provided it with the description belonging to the c u . unlike amazon s description this is not a mic that comes with usb plug phantom power and computer connectivity . and of course none of the advertised included computer software programs is included . it s a conventional studio mic that requires connection to a regular amp p .a . with an xlr jack and phantom power . it will not connect to the usb port of a computer without an expensive adapter and a preamp with phantom power . moreover amazon s form thus far is denying a refund and offering only replacement presumably for another mic just like this one ! if you want the described mic amazon is showing it from a different vendor at about more plus s h . the behringer c mic is the best condenser mic i ve used for the money its large diaphragm capable of reproducing some of the rich and deep sonorities of the costly high end mics at the radio station npr where i occasionally work . however behringer makes a distinction between the c and the c u . the description on amazon fits the c u not the c . so one way or another of the purchasers of this product are likely to be surprised and disappointed .indeed the c u is a phantom powered mic that doesn t require phantom power which it derives from the usb port of a computer . moreover the mic not only saves its owner the bother of a pre amp with phantom power but it also makes unnecessary a costly and time consuming xlr to usb adapter . it s ready to go just plug it into your laptop and start recording . i use sound studio but the included free software audacity works practically as well . on the other hand if the mic is a c as advertised be prepared to receive a conventional condenser mic with an xlr connector and a phantom power requirement found on numerous recording devices and p .a . amps or available on a neat little pre amp sold by amazon the a .r .t . .having just returned a keyboard the m audio pro sx for which amazon mistakenly provided the wrong description for the m audio pro not the pro sx i d be hesitant to place any bets on which mic the buyer will receive the c as advertised or the c u as described . at least if you re purchasing directly from amazon instead of a sub vendor you can be assured of a hassle free return . and if the mistake is due to amazon s description returns are generally postage free .
these are staples that fit stanley bostitch b staplers the size that staples up to sheets of paper . most staplers have the model and type and or size of staple to buy stamped somewhere on the body of the stapler . i have a year old stapler that is stamped bostitch b and use only bostitch b staples . the problem i had was that there are two sizes of b staples and . so i measured the height of the staple holding compartment which was . since is less than i knew then that the b staple would not fit my stapler . only the would fit . i hope my experience is helpful to you in determining the correct staple to buy for your stapler .this is a nice heavy stapler . it is metal not plastic . it takes standard staples . it will hold a pretty good stack of paper too almost as thick as the staple prong . i am very happy with this stapler and should i need another it will be this particular brand and model .the venerable full length desktop swingline model has occupied countless offices for decades . it was made in the usa and weighs lb . ounces . this more modern version of that classic stapler introduced almost years ago weighs just . ounces is about inch shorter and is made in china yet holds as many of the same staples and offers identical features .like the previous model this stapler will join up to sheets of paper and opens so it can be used as a tacker . the entire bottom of this stapler is rubber covered to protect table and desk surfaces . there is no lever action so joining a large sheaf of papers will require more force than a levered stapler as was the case with the model .like swingline s previous model this stapler offers the option of rotating the strike plate to fold the staples inward conventionally to join papers more permanently or to fold the staples outward so the staples can be more easily removed without a tool . with less weight this stapler appears to be as usable and durable as any of swingline s previous classic models .
the listing for this item can be confusing if you are not sure what stereo xlr is . stereo xlr is meant to be similar to your stereo headphones where left and right are separate unbalanced wires . this cable is configured to be a stereo unbalanced xlr to a stereo unbalanced trs cable . this item is not a mono balanced xlr to a stereo unbalanced mic cable .a little bit a soldering can fix this connector by moving the red wire from ping to pin with the white wire . pin then ties to pin with the ground wire .it s a well build daisy chain dc power cable . it has good lenght between two plugs . you won t have difficulties to plug your pedals .five stars because it works on my digitech gnx guitar processor which requires volts and about milli amps . this has an output of milli amps . for electronics the voltage has to be correct . but an appliance will only draw as many amps current as it needs . so this adapter is coasting when used with the guitar processor and can be used with other devices that draw up to the mamps . just be sure your v device doesn t require more than the ma this can deliver . but it s a power adapter i cannot be in love with a power adapter .
gm has two different coils for this vehicle so their fit index isn t correct . one wire set is an . inches shorter . see other reviews for info . with the right part they went right on and work as intended .these were a perfect fit for my silverado hd with the . but i had to do some research to make sure i bought the correct wire set . gm used round or square coils two different manufacturers for a few years and the plug wire lengths are different . if you have the round coils plug wire connector on the bottom of the coil you need these shorter wires ending in gg . if you have the square coils with the plug wire connector on the side of the coil you need the longer wires ending in hh . the hh wires are about . inches longer for than the gg s . you cannot make the shorter wires reach a square coil .the tender jr . does not come with a cigarette adapter so i cut this in half to make two . i purchased lighter plugs for a buck each from china with free shipping and they are working fine . these aren t an exact match with the tender cables but they fit together ok and are easy to determine polarity with the wire colors . you can also just use this as an extension cord for your tender . the description states a length of inches but it s actually inches tip to tip on the connectors . nice item for the price and it s made in mexico .
innova diagnostic code reader for obdii vehiclesi purchased this product last month and i don t know why . it reads your on board computer alright . but if you want a detail report of a problem you might be having with your check engine light on they charge you a fee for a complete detail report .autozone advanceauto and carquest will test your vehicle free of charge and will provide you with a detail report for free .the fleecing of america continues by online companies .amazon shame of you ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !amazon really needs to check some of their cross reference charts . this does not it a kia lx sorento .this product appears to include the cable . it doesn t . it s just the mount which it does okay but you ll have to buy the cable separately .
it s a standard airline tubing and it works well with my whisper air pump . feet is plenty but i wish i got this is a soft easy to use tubing from elite . the silicone airline slides easily onto nipples of the pump and fittings . this tubing for aquariums will be used for a bait well and should hold up and provide me with feet of blue tubing for my airlines . nice product better than the other tubing i have used . i like it .the fittings are not standard for python or aqueon pumps .so it sits in a bin unused till i get adapters .
the metal arms are solid so is the base but i don t know why the holes in the metal arms aren t pre drilled to accept the twist screws . it was also perplexing why the one arm was round instead of square at least the square arms have better grip traction for the crews . also mine came with no instructions and in general came very unprofessionally packed . for awhile i though i had gotten a used refurbished unit . also would be better if the wire loop hook on their deep dome lamp was wider to actually sit in the hook of the lamp stand rather then sit on top of it .fit my gallon long wide high just right . the two glass pieces came already inserted into the plastic piece that allows the glass to be lifted for feeding . the other extra plastic piece goes onto the rear glass piece in case you have filters in the back and need to cut slots out for them . however i don t use that plastic piece and have a inch and a half space that fits well for my filter and heater . it also comes with an attachable handle that makes it easier to lift the glass .i bought this cage based on the size of it and for the price . it s perfect for my cockatiel . it wasn t difficult to put together either . i read the directions but they were somewhat confusing at first because there weren t any pictures to show what the different metal grates were used for . i just referred to the black and white picture on amazon if i had any doubts . the cage is simple to put together . half of it is put together already so you just have to bend the metal hooks on the sides of it to keep it to together and add the top and bottom grate . the stand was a little more difficult in that you need to use the wrench they provide while using a plier or another wrench to hold the bolt while you screw it tightly but the manufacturer keeps all the stand stuff including the grate for the stand together so it s easy to figure out what goes where .the plastic tray that goes on the bottom is a nice heavy grade of plastic . it s not that cheap hard plastic that cracks easily . the plastic tray is the only plastic thing on the cage . it s all metal except for the tray .the color of the cage isn t black though . it s more of a deep speckled gray . it s nice and the color wasn t an issue for me anyway .there are a lot of doors in this cage . the top opens up and there s a perch that keeps it held open .i had no problem with damaged parts or missing parts . everything in the box was in perfect condition and not damaged or anything .oh the directions to put the cage together were on the outside of the box along with the shipping label from amazon . they aren t in the box so don t go crazy thinking you may have thrown them out like i did .i recommend this cage . it s a heck of a lot cheaper than my local store too .
i recently bought a new printer and i tried this paper to go along with it . i am very impressed . in fact this multipurpose brightness paper by xerox gives you something to sing about ! i use this paper with my inkjet printers and i can use it to make signs to tape to my front door indicating to delivery people which doorbell to ring !the paper is not expensive for all the ten reams that you get and it almost never jams in my printer at home . nevertheless i always fan the paper to make sure that it doesn t jam . after i fan the paper to make sure two pieces of paper aren t stuck to each other then i place it in my inkjet printer .in addition this paper can also be used in laser printers copiers and plain paper fax machine . each page is a clean cut inches by inches . great !this paper never goes stale so stock up on it if you can catch a sale on it . moreover this is excellent paper that avoids ink from smearing as it is printed on the page . it stores particularly well in the heavy duty thick cardboard box in which it comes . great !i recently tried this paper to use with my hp inkjet printer that is about two years old . i am very impressed . in fact this multipurpose brightness paper yes that s what they advertise brightness by epson gives you something to sing about ! i use this paper with my inkjet printers and i can use it to make signs to tape to my front door indicating to delivery people which doorbell to ring ! actually it s good for just about anything i need to print with my inkjet printer including intense colors or artwork from a webpage that i want to keep in printed form for my records . the paper may buckle ever so slightly if you have to print a large square circle or rectangular shape in a single color but this buckling isn t too noticeable .in addition this paper practically never jams in my printer at home . nevertheless i always fan the paper to make extra certain that it doesn t jam . after i fan the paper to make sure two pieces of paper aren t stuck to each other then i place it in my inkjet printer tray .each page is a clean cut inches by inches . great ! although they don t say this i would imagine that this paper can also be used in copiers plain paper fax machine and maybe even in laser printers . if you want to use this paper with laser printers print out a test page or two before you buy several reams .this paper never goes stale so stock up on it if you can catch a sale on it . as of this writing the amazon price seems a bit high so check with amazon to make sure that the above price is correct .in any event this is excellent paper and i highly recommend this product .i have used it in my hp laser printer and my wife uses it in her brother laser printer and it always delivers clean clear printouts even on side .update after using this paper in my hp laserjet printer to print documents on sides of the paper discovered that the heat produced a very strong curl on the ends of the paper on the first side printed and it made it extremely difficult to feed the paper back into the printer and get reliable feeding for side . absolutely ruined a nd side printing of a page document . took stars off of the original rating for this problem and don t think that i ll purchase this paper again .
as several of the previous posters astutely mentioned you will need a noise gate to use this pedal . i completely agree with that . and it will sustain your notes . it will actually raise the volume to make them sustain . but you will have extraneous hiss when the guitar is not playing to cover it up . the only way to get rid of this hiss is to use a noise gate . i use the ns when i use my chain of pedals . that said this pedals has some wonderful uses . every note will have the same volume . you can hit the chord as hard as you like or as softly and it will play at the same volume . you can set it to sustain for days . again you will need a noise gate . there is nothing transparent about this compressor as there is almost all of my other compressors but none of them are as active as this one . perhaps that s the price you pay for what this pedal can do . i recommend messing with it quite a while . you can do some incredible funk jazz metal vibes out of it .this capo will do the job if you can squeeze it open . i m hoping that leaving it on the headstock will lessen the spring tension . it is all i can do to open and place this on the guitar . i cannot do it with one hand .this issue with this bad boy is not quality features or design . this is a pedaltrain product and just like my pedaltrain this is a well made perfectly designed board that does exactly what it claims it will do it holds freaking pounds of guitar effects stuff . and that my friends is the problem .i am using a voodoo labs x power supply but had to also get a tripplite isobar outlet power strip that i drilled into the upper left corner to handle a couple of the extra pedals . i plug that into the wall and then use a homemade iec power plug in the voodoo . on the pedal i was able to fit jim dunlop volume pedals one is for the looper a crybaby wah tc electronic flashback x sparkbooster mojo mojo overdrive corona chorus hall of fame reverb ditto looper and the shaker vibrato . i also have the mxr flanger helicon harmony pedal for vocals a korg tuner and an electro harmonix pulsar tremolo . i know i know . did i mention this sucker is big ? i feel like they should name it the pedal porch . maybe i can put a few potted plants on it .so getting back to the question of whether or not you should get this behemoth i will ask you to ask yourself do i really need all these pedals ? if the answer is hell yes i deserve them all ! i worked hard for them and can now make awesome sounds ! ! then by all means knock yourself out . just don t get a hernia lugging it around and make sure you book venues with appropriate stage space . no joke .
i bought this to raise up my laptop and connected a separate keyboard to the laptop . it works fine and helps keep my shoulders from hurting by being slumped over . fuzzy wuzzy s summary highly recommended with warm fuzzies !packaging style appearance excellent fuzzies ratingconstruction build quality excellent fuzzies ratingcompetitive pricing value average not good not bad fuzzies rating positives high build quality with good welds and smooth semi gloss black enamel coating . strong steel tubular legs can support up to pounds . if you use this as a laptop riser stand by placing a laptop on the top shelf the surface is perforated with many holes to allow for great air circulation and heat dissipation . negatives there are no negatives with this product this is an excellent solidly built steel stand that both looks attractive with its uniform semi gloss black enamel coating and can support a large computer display monitor or any other item weighing up to pounds . you can either place this on your desk or on a table or countertop e .g . some people have a computer in their kitchen to organize your computer laptop keyboard display layout better .this monitor stand weighs . pounds and has outer dimensions of . width x . depth x . height . the top shelf has surface dimensions of . width x . depth . the space underneath the shelf is . wide which is the . outer width minus the width of the two tubular legs . the space underneath the shelf has a usable height of . which is the . outer height minus the height of the tubular metal that supports the top shelf .even though this is advertised as a monitor stand i am using this as a laptop stand placing a inch laptop on top of the shelf . my computer desk already has a raised shelf where my two display monitors are positioned and my desk has an adjustable keyboard tray where my keyboard and mouse reside . i have multiple desktop and laptop computers so sometimes i place one laptop underneath this stand s shelf with its lid closed and a vga cable connecting that laptop to a larger monitor and another inch laptop sits on the top shelf of this stand . when placing a laptop on this stand where i use a separate bluetooth keyboard instead of the laptop s own keyboard the stand s perforated metal surface functions like a ventilated platform to help cool the laptop . since many laptops have their fan intake vents located underneath the laptop it is advantageous that this stand s shelf surface is a perforated metal grill to allow for great air circulation all along the bottom of the laptop . most of the other laptop riser stands are either made of flimsy plastic or metal mesh that is too thin with too much flex in the structure .but regardless of whether you need to place a large display monitor a large laptop or other item this stand serves as a simple sturdy and modern looking support .the allsop metal art monitor stand is a really great sturdy flat screen monitor holder that can fit an entire toshiba laptop under it !
i usually love all avery products and i must say that i m adding this product to my favorites as well . these labels printed out well and i had no smearing when i applied them to my mailing envelopes . also what i loved about them that it wasn t hard to peel and reposition them on the envelope once it caught . the color blended nicely with my white evenlopes so well that it appeared as if i printed the address on the envelope itself . i love these labels ! from now on i ll be buying these instead of the store brand i always buy .it might seem silly to be excited about labels but i am . i ve been looking for labels that aren t a pain in the you know what and i ve found them .these labels are return address label sized sheet . i ll be using them for that as well but my initial use is for reorder labels on products i sell . the printing is clear and smudge proof important for labels with small print that might be exposed to liquids or creams .what i like best about these is the easy peel feature which will save much time and aggravation when i m label several items or envelopes at once . i ll be ordering these again but with labels per sheet it may be a while .i am using these stickers for two purposes so far highlighting our website by printing its address on these stickers and attaching them to receipts and to advise customers to shake well before using on the bottle .i could of course include these statements on the receipt and packaging but there is something more pleasing and certainly more eye catching in attaching these stickers . i am sure that there are a thousand and uses for these stickers .printing on these stickers is very easy using word filemaker or a range of other programs .
works with a lot of mics and with a little modding it worked with my mxl v g which is all i needed it for .i didn t do the sound quality test but i have another one of these and it works just fine . i just tested if all the plugs work and they do . if i ll get some sound problems i will write an update but i m confident that it s going to be ok .if was looking to get my amps off the flood . i have w amps and a big fender dsp . i am using this for my amps . it works very well . i recommend them to do the job for the . i am not sure i would use them for a sunn v x cabinet
as a teacher and lecturer i was excited to learn of this remote control for presentation software . note that presentation software really means microsoft powerpoint . the presenter does not work with wordperfect s presentations software i can t comment about its use with other software . before buying this presenter i was tied to a podium as i felt that i needed to be within arm s length of the forward and backward buttons on the computer . however this presenter has a range of feet and includes a laser pointer which allows me to roam around the room . the presenter uses two aaa batteries and the power is controlled by the usb plug that is stored in the pointer itself . storing the usb plug in the pointer turns the pointer off while removing the plug from the pointer turns it on . the usb plug needs to be inserted into a computer and then receives the signal from the presenter pointer to control the presentation . the most complex part of using the device is installing and changing the batteries which is not complex at all . the presenter has a nice rounded contoured shape and is comfortable to hold . using this remote presenter is a truly liberating experience and a benefit to those who use powerpoint for presentations .pros . takes normal batteries . . bright well focused laser . . uses radio frequency communication not ir so you do not need line of sight to the computer . it will go through a wood podium . . works great with apple keynote and microsoft powerpoint . . works great with mac os x windows and linux . . no need to screw around with bluetooth .cons nonethis simple remote has one clever design aspect the built in usb adapter and one significant flaw it s far too easy to hit the bottom screen off button in the middle of a presentation . but if you don t need anything fancy this is a good inexpensive choice . it s played well with every mac and pc i ve plugged it into .one way that kensington could make their next model more useful would be for the usb adapter to double as a thumbdrive . since you ll be plugging it into the host computer anyway why not put your presentation on it ? sadly the small dongle s only purpose is to provide a wireless connection .
it doesn t make the giggling noises very easily i have to shake it hard to make it work . so when my dog is playing with it it is just another ball . . . . it s just okay .your cat will love these colorful very soft plastic loopy toys . they are made of very soft plastic that can t break and hurt your cat . your cat will have fun batting them around carrying them in their mouth promotes the hunter in your cat . don t be surprised when you find your cat bring you one as its prize catch .if you have cats that decide they want to jump over this thing it won t work so well . the size of it is great for litter boxes with covers there are cats that can t stand the texture of this thing and try really hard to avoid the texture . know your cat . . .it works for many but there are a few that it just won t work for .
i bought this for my teen son for christmas . he loves to play his bass and sing along . he had a different shure mic and it was totally flat compared to this particular model . nice and clean sounds plus it seems pretty sturdy . we did get him a mic stand and it fits on it perfectly and stays put . shure knocked this one out of the park .i have a cedar topped acoustic and these strings brought it to life without losing the cedar smoothness . no mud clear mids and highs with clashing . mounted them with the brass tone pins and this guitar just rings like a bell now . love it .does what it says ! i live the rounded edges and more streamlined apperance it dosnt jump out and scream look what someone stuck to this fine guiitar like some of the brightly colored plastic ones on the market seem to do this is obviously higher quality . well made a nice spring inside its practically invisible but there to slip out a pick on the fly whenever you need one !
they do work . exactly as advertised . hane no fear on buying these . fit the chevy silverado wt tailgate rods .works just like it needs to . perfect fit for the tailgate on my chevy when the oem clip busted .i tried to be careful so i enter my car information . amazon fit checks show that it would fit lexus ls . i ordered and found out it didn t fit . my car has an arm that requires the thin side but this wiper blade is too big to fit .
i did not buy this but i have the medela pump in style . thanks to those who mentioned that the evenflo nipples would fit the bottles but it s the evenflo classic nipples that fit not the evenflo elite nipples . now i just need to find caps that would fit without having to buy this whole set .these worked with the medela breast pump . two different sizes comes in the box . one size did work with the natural flow bottles .these discs work well with avent products . they also fit in my lansinoh bottles .
the dymo is a great label printer . we have of them at work that see daily usage . the printers themselves are terrific . they just work . no jams no failures extremely few misprints . we do a lot of volume printing for shipping labels and name tags and the dymo s never have issues .they print about one tag per second which is fast enough for us . if yo you want greater speed get thedymo turbo . they don t print in color but we don t need color for shipping labels and name tags .i do not recommend you use the printing software that comes with them . it is pretty poor . also don t install the drivers that come on the cd . download the newest ones directly from dymo s webpage . that will save you a lot of hassles as some of these seem to ship with outdated problematic drivers . this is especially true if you re using the printer with vista !overall these get the job done with a minimum of fuss . they don t print in color and the drivers are spotty but they are fantastic at what they re intended for printing labels .this is a great printer for someone who only needs something for personal use . if you need something for school or work this isn t something that is meant to hold up to everyday constant printing or copying . i have a laser printer for that . i use this for faxing and occasional copying and scanning with the printing for sometime color jobs sometimes pictures which works wonderfully . inkjets suck up ink it s a fact . you can get printers for the cost of cartridges now so if you pick out an all in one make sure that s what you need that s what i did . i love it !hp officejet all in one printer fax scanner copier q a aba i love the canon ink it works good and it does clog up your printers gives you beautiful photos i will never change this brand thanks again amazon for another job well done
these filters are awesome . nice and quiet . adjustable water flow . and the fact that you can basically customize your filter media is great . only things keep these from being perfect . the main thing is the gallon size they are rated for . in my opinion if it says good for to gallon size tank for example you are better off putting it in the smallest size of the range listed . the one i got for my gallon tank just seems a wee bit too small to really handle a full gallons so i ordered a larger size and will be putting this gallon rated one on my gallon tank . the second thing is if you customize your filter media make sure you weight it down somehow . was having a problem with my media filter floss floating to the top making the bio max sit completely above the water in the filter . using the manufacturer s media which i am sure they recommend does not result in this problem the sponges that come with these are firmly held in place by tabs in the media basket . bottom line . . .these are as close to perfect as you can get .when you purchase one of their filters the intake tubes that come are generally too short . mine runs about of the way to the bottom and should be closest to the bottom as possible .over the past thirty years i ve tried about every air pump there is and in my opinion the rena trumps them all .these air pumps are quiet efficient and with minimal care should last for many years . like all air pumps replacing the intake filter with new ones is imperative for keeping vibration and noise at a minimum .the is perfect for tanks ranging in size from gallons .they re easily adjustable dual output ports let you configure just how much air you need to drive your aeration bubble wands walls air stones sponge filters power heads and so on .the hundred is the largest in the line and like all rena pumps their curved design and expansion chambers keep vibration and noise to a minimum .replacing the diaphragm is easy to do on these pumps just remember to buy two replacement kits one for each intake port .quick specs powerful dual out put dual control valves year warranteelike any quality air pump keeping a drip loop and using check valves in your air line tubing is essential .add the mix changing the air filter from time to time and the rena will reward you with years of efficient trouble free service .
this filter worked great on my chevy silverado with a . l even though amazon says it doesn t ! ! ! it s a original equipment o .e . filter so that s another plus in quality ! ! ! how to i know for sure of the correct filter . i have a alldata .com subscription for my truck . years was like . . . so a great deal . i get access to everything i need to know on my truck . how to do things hours it ll take to do a job o .e . part numbers and prices etc . . so i looked up fuel filter and it told me the o .e . part number for the filter is looking that up on google i find that number crosses over to the gf filter . from this web site . . . sure enough it fit just fine . though the filter that was on it was a gf ! which was the original on my truck . i guess there has been a number change . just to make sure once again i checked directly from acdelco for a fuel filter for my truck . you can check it out here . . . and then click on parts catalog ! ! anyway sure enough it also shows the gf fuel filter for my truck ! ! !it s a filter what s to say ? acdelco filters are quality filters . can t go wrong with installing another o .e . filter onto your car truck ! since i changed out the cooled in my truck for the first time in the years i ve had it the dex cool coolant still looked great . i drained and changed the coolant with a blend coolant so i wouldn t have to use tap water or have to buy distilled water ! ! ! this is how you get coolant to last a long time . not contaminating with tap water ! ! ! anyway did coolant change oil change oil filter change fuel filter change and air filter change . i have about miles on my truck . normal maintenance type stuff . it s on it s rd ac compressor so ac system is good new belts when that work was done .i have over years experience with transmission coolers and the b m stacked plate transmission coolers are still the best in the business ! !i recently installed a model in my restored mercury grand marquis v automatic trans and the improvements are distinctly noticeable . the lower transmission fluid temperatures make the transmission work more smoothly especially with the quicker sharper up shifts and the firm down shifts too ! !all the hardware was included and the installation was quick and easy .other reviewers have recommended routing your cooler lines to the tranny cooler first but that is completely wrong all transmission cooler manufacturers as well as ford motor company tell us to route the cooler lines to the radiator first and they tell us this because they know from decades of experience and thousands of installations on all types of vehicles that the coolers work best when routed to the radiator first ! !when installing a tranny cooler it s a good idea to drop the tranny pan and change the tranny filter i added a b m drain plug kit to make future transmission service easier .you can t go wrong if you just follow b m s clear and complete instructions ! !i did not use the nylon anchor straps through the radiator instead hanging the cooler about . inches forward of the ac condenser with the hose fittings pointing up as recommended by b m . mounting the cooler with the fittings at the top will assure that the entire trans cooler surface is being utilized .with cooler properly installed the transmission now runs at degrees mph with outside air temps of degrees f .valvoline synthetic transmission fluid has given me great service after many years of desert and mountainous driving i recommend it highly with no additives ! ! most important ! ! after installation be sure to fill transmission fluid to the proper level add fluid only ounces at a time check again and do not over fill ! ! too much fluid leads to aeration and certain transmission failure ! !good luck ! !california v camry with p and p . two of my code tables show as bank sensor a f sensor so i ordered the denso o sensor . came in on time and package well protected but looks like its the wrong one my fault somewhat . turns out as far as i could tell my two tables from two different sources had it backwards as it should be bank sensor a f and denso amazon order check didn t help much either .anyway bank sensor is the one on the engine right front easy to get to where denso refer as upstream front . i gave it stars base on previous experience will order this one later .why the a few of you refer as bank sensor and still corrected the check engine light ? that would not be this one for the the toyota v but denso where they refer as upstream rear . am i wrong ?seems like i m not the only one confused based on superceeded information on p and p .this one is for bank sensor for the toyota v engine mine is the mzfe .
i love any velcro but this is definately extra strong adhesive . i love the large roll that i can cut to any length i need . the quantity is worth the price . i do suggest you have pair of scissors especially for velcro . the adhesive sticks to them and you ll need to clean them off periodically with a knife . that will cause difficulties with anything else you may want to cut .i do a lot arts and crafts and find this set very useful in those projects so many bold and bright colors to pick from . i also use them to label photos and they work well with that too . you can t smell them unless you stick your nose up to them . they are non toxic and come with a satisfaction guarantee . don t do like i did and try opening the case in a hurry on the right edge use the tab on the lower left to open it right and protect the case .i don t send a whole lot of mail but when i do it tends to be pretty overloaded . folded up sheets of documents stuffed in bookmarks and trinkets and other things that tend to play havoc with the standard glue seals . oftentimes thinner envelopes won t even close on account of the bulges .these envelopes are strong enough and have enough room to fit anything i ve thrown into one so far . they seal perfectly fine i haven t had any issues contrary to what some reviewers claimed .the envelopes themselves are thick enough that i d trust them for important forms and correspondence . overall they work great and i don t see any need to get anything pricier .
i live in an apartment so it doesn t make sense for me to have an entire filing cabinet for documents and papers that need to be properly organized and stored . this fills that void perfectly without taking up much space . i keep it in the bottom of my closet and it takes up little to no space among the shoe racks .it easily fits a large amount of letter size papers and while your smaller pieces id cards etc . may get lost in the bottom you are able to locate it fairly easily as each compartment reaches all the way to the bottom .the top is a bit wobbly and flimsy . i can see that being a concern if you were to keep it in places where water may be an issue but i am dry in my closet .all in all this is perfect for getting your stuff organized in limited space .i have this organizer in a nook between my desk and my filing cabinet . it works great to hold all my current projects . the compartments are wide enough to hold few magazines or journals for reference while not taking up more space than needed . the bottom two shelves are just extra storage for me so are only used rarely . great quality !for a box designed specifically for dvds i expected this to be relatively snug on the side so they can t move around . instead there is an entire inch of space . . . so the dvds move around . . not to mention the extra space it takes up for absolutely no reason .it stays together fine so far . the lid is a bit loose so i don t think it is the greatest long term storage option but it makes it easier to remove replace which works well for something to keep movies or games you watch play frequently .
does what it says it does . . . . . .looks great !as others have noted the picture shows it to be much darker than it really is . it does help tone down my state issued yellow plate though so it serves its purpose somewhat .these item does fit perfect on my bmw x . does what its suppose to do . so far so good thanks
reading some reviews here i see that some people make the mistake of assuming that any glue or cement should suit all purposes . in fact most glues are best suited for specific purposes that is why there are so many different kinds .rubber cement is unique in a few ways . it is not water based that is evident as soon as you open the jar . it smells of an organic solvent . you don t want to breathe in a lot of that . best to use it in a ventilated area .in the name of the product is what it excels at no wrinkle . the solvent in it causes the cement to reduce in volume as it dries that is it shrinks so it makes a snug fit .it is especially well suited to gluing fairly flexible things like paper or foil to many other things like paper foil plastic wood metal etc . the solvent could be reactive to some things making it unsuitable for some materials . items glued down with rubber cement can often be peeled away even after the glue has dried the glue can usually be rubbed off . on some porous substances some kinds of paper the glue could soak in and change the color .it may also be suited for fixing items together in a temporary fashion in which case the glue can often be rubbed off . but when attached to rigid materials and especially when protected e .g . covered with a laminate it is reasonably permanent .because it is not water soluble it might be handy for joining things that need to stay stuck while immersed in water .it is used a lot by all kinds of crafts . i like to print templates or labels designed on the computer then trim them with scissors or a paper cutter then use rubber cement to attach it to metal plastic or wood . then i take it down to the shop and use the printed guides to cut or drill . i can also overlay the result with clear laminate to have a permanent protected and professional looking panel for example in electronics projects .rubber cement is not especially well suited to joining hard things to other hard things materials like plastic wood metal and so on except for temporary purposes in which case it can be very handy if you need to separate them later and remove the glue . for example to cut sheet aluminum i may glue plywood to both sides with rubber cement for more rigidity cut it then remove the plywood .last chemical interactions with old style pre digital photographs could potentially fade the photographic image with time this may apply to other kinds of printed material with time as well .this product is becoming harder to locate . newer tapes are the invisible type with a frosted finish but the adhesive is weak and does not stick to plastics . this regular old style transparent tape is still the best overall sticky tape . it sticks where it is placed and does not come off on plastic or slippery surface . scotch tape costs more but it is a thicker sheet of plastic and makes better bonds especially if used to hold a package together . you get what you pay for .this tape is almost identical to standard scotch packaging tape except that this book tape seems slightly thicker and perhaps easier to reposition . both are clear and glossy and both are available in various widths . standard packaging tape is usually wide this particular product is .if you are looking to repair pages inside a book this will not blend in well as it is too glossy . instead i use scotch magic mending tape for repairing tears in individual pages . the magic mending tape seems to just disappear into the paper . but for torn endpapers just inside the cover i recommend using something like this book tape as you need strength or it just won t hold .our local library sometimes uses this tape to reinforce the outside of paperback bindings but they use a different matte tape for the insides which matches the paper much better .another idea to consider for paperbacks that will see a lot of use you can get book laminating film that will cover the entire book cover . wrap it around the cover edges with appropriate cuts at the corners so it folds neatly inside . i ve had very good results with this method it looks great and protects and reinforces the entire cover and edges .however for simple reinforcement of book splines this product does just fine .
when cosleeping with an infant this adds and extra sense of security . the top half of the sleeper is great formed out of a rigid plastic tray but the bottom half is just the this foam mattress with no support underneath . because of this it tends to cause a downhill slope and baby slides down .we gave up on using this within a week and just put him in bed with us until we could buy an arms reach mini cosleeper .the close and secure sleeper might be helpful when used in a crib and when travelling but it has limited value in an adult bed or at least it did for us .this is a good step stool . it helps my cautious year old get into her queen size bed no frame .our little girl refuses to sleep in her bassinet and would only stay asleep on our bed close to us . because of the dangers of sids we didn t feel this was good enough so we would end up staying up all night with her . after seeing this on amazon we figured it was worth a try . it is working out perfectly . the baby has a soft comfortable place to sleep yet is protected from any dangers on sleeping with us . the walls of the bed are hard enough that a full sized adult will have a hard time rolling over the bed and child . if your child tends to sleep with you in the bed this sleeper is a must . the led light is a nice touch . perfect to check up on her in the middle of the night .
easy to mount and adjust . since each one is made identical there is no right or left you just mount the mirror differently one has the tensioner lever right next to the mirror drivers side in my case . that is not a problem if you place it back from your mirror . good sturdy mount and no vibration . once adjusted they are easy on and off .the picture is slightly misleading . this is only the mounting bracket it does not come with any wiring . but is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a wire flat cable . the bracket is flat on one side and curved on the other . the curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch . the connector on the end of my t connector fits well and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket . it sure beets having the connector flopping around !these kc s light up dark lonely places with brilliant far reaching white light even better than i had imagined they would . install was easy on my jk using smittybilt brackets . the switch works great adjustment of the beams was easy positive with a mm wrench for the horizontal a mm socket extension for the vertical . antenna interference with the passenger side light was avoided by angling the antenna back behind the light . nice product !
this pump works well has pleanty of power comes with a cute and practical purse bag and since i use the playtex drop in bottles it was a great match . it also works with other bottles .bought these because we were using a medela pump and philips bottles . of course the breast pump and bottle industry can t make it easy for everything to work together . these adapters fit great onto the pump and the philips bottles . don t feel forced to buy all new bottles or a brand new pump just to make your system work !works great with my pump n style and allows me to pump on the go when necessary . be sure to check the voltage on our your pump before purchasing some are volt not volt .
i too am an automotive detailer i ve used this product for quite some time . it used to be called all wheel cleaner but is not called all wheel and tire cleaner .i don t get the negative reviews this product works great for many applications . applications as in wheels tires and even plastic wheel wells where gritty dirt accumulates .wet the wheel down make sure it s cold you don t want to apply this or anything for that matter to an extremely hot surface . . work one wheel at a time rinse apply product let sit a few seconds scrub the tire and wheel with a soft to moderate bristle brush and rinse away . . . you shouldn t have a problem and you should see a dramatic improvement .cons this stuff isn t cheap and it doesn t last for more than about sets of tires and wheels . use it only when completely necessary . if you wash your car often don t use this all of the time unless your budget is better than mine . use your car wash detergent or even dawn dish soap along with the above described method of application removal . it rids wheels and tires of light soil quite well .be careful with this stuff though . . . it is not for all wheels like it says it is . meguiars also make a milder chrome and mag cleaner as well as aluminum wheel cleaner .krud kutter i applaud your efforts at green cleaning however you disappoint this consumer when it comes to one specific area mildew removal . cleans what ordinary cleaners simply can t ! doesn t seem to cover mildew as stated on your label . to me that s a basic and one that s a pretty good test for any cleaner particularly biodegradable ones that are not designed to bleach but rather to eat away stains .what krud kutter can do is offer a color fast fabric safe earth friendly cleaning solution to help you clean up things that are sticky greasy oily or waxy . it is good at basic clean ups but what it can t do is everything it claims on the bottle .perhaps my expectations were just too high and perhaps it was my experience with another product but this one is just ok to me thus the out of stars .what i like about krud kutter earth friendly always a good thing . concentrated all jobs don t need full strength use thus the product lasts longer in theory . safely removes . . . although this one is questionable as there are warnings about eye and skin contact as well as ingestion . it does work on things like shoe scuffs on vinyl and wood flooring without bleaching the surface . it cuts common dirt and grease very well at full strength including hairspray residue . biodegradable thus safe for use on rv s boats and plumbing that feeds to a septic tank .what i don t like about krud kutter the very first thing i tried to clean was mildew spots on my bathroom ceiling a teenager who likes long showers and doesn t turn on the fan . . . and at full strength with applications it did not go away . i began to see them lighten but they did not go away completely via just spraying and leaving the cleaner to do its work . eventually i wiped things down and it looks ok but the bottom line on mildew a bleach solution still works better as doessimple green clean building all purpose concentrate cleaner gallon bottle . might just want to scratch mildew off the list for this product or not put so much hype on the bottle . if it works most jobs require full strength application despite what it says on the label regarding dilutions .for sticky greasy jobs this cleaner works well . but i m not completely sold that its claims match what it can do on all fronts . a good earth friendly cleaning product but not an all purpose one .if you want to try another product for greasy and sticky jobs that i like better i would recommend tryingspray nine grez off heavy duty degreaser oz .instead which is also biodegradable and works incredibly well ! spray nine s product is least more effective on sticky and greasy messes than krud kutter and it costs less too .although it too is not for mildew .update i ve boosted my rating from to stars for this product . the more i use it the better i like it particularly for sticky residue on vinyl flooring . a wet mop with a quick spray of this lightly over the surface seems to do a better job on my kitchen and bathroom floor than any other cleaners i ve found . it s not as heavy duty as spray nine but the fumes are much less too and if used frequently there s no need to use a stronger product .i have used this solvent a number of times to remove adhesive and badging from my cars . for that it works wonderfully . when used modestly it does not effect automotive surfaces or glass . since this stuff is so potent i would recommend using the the spray straw in the nozzle so that you can more carefully target where you spray this stuff . you want to be very careful where you put it . it also evaporates rapidly so you need to work quickly when you use it .just to reinforce a few precautions do not get this on plastic it will discolor it or any soft organic materials . do not use around high eat as it is extremely flammable limit all bodily exposureoverall this is a wonderful product just be very careful how you use it .
i was really interested in the m and checked with the fender forum and i found that there is a problem with the m . you can go to the fender forum and read about it under the mustang amp section .to make the long story short some not all m m m s have what is decribed as a fizz on the clean setting when hitting the low e string . sometimes it s noticably loud and sometimes it is barely audible . some people think it s the power supply but nobody knows for sure . apparently fender has not made a statement to its cause although they admitted that there is a fizz problem . there is also a sample sound clip there on this fizz .like i said i just want people to know about this before buying a m . now i am considering the m which also has the fizz problem but with the the software fix released from fender there is no fizz in the m . i don t know if it is fair for me to give it a rating because i didn t get the m but if i bought it i would give it a rating of stars because i don t like this fizz on the clean setting and it would be unusable for me . if it didn t have this fizz i would give it a star rating .i am absolutely delighted with this tunner . one comment my son has one also the neck of his broke so he warned me . i am always very careful when turning the head . i can see where you might break the neck if you are unaware that it could happen . as far as tuning goes i am very pleased . i moved from a guitar to a harp so i am tuning many more strings and this is very helpful ! plus my vision is not the best and this one i can really see !as a newbie violin student i needed a music stand . having purchased many things before through amazon .com i have learned to trust the customer reviews which get posted remembering that there will always be a few cranks . this music stand got good reviews and i can say that i too am very happy with it . i would recommend this purchase to any one .
these work better than any deodorizer i ve seen . pleasant natural smell nothing nasty but enough to cover up any lingering smell that does seep out of a diaper pail . very happy !this is a good product . it allows for quick and easy disposal of diapers wipes etc . and does not require any special bags . unlike other reviewers i have not had any problems with it getting stuck . it does start to smell when there are poopy diapers in it but i can t imagine that any product could completely eliminate poopy diaper odor ! ! if you change the bag regularly you should not have any problem with odor .this product isn t that bad . . . however it is not smell proof . i love the fact that it will take any type of trash bag but if you do not empty the pail out daily the smell leaks out into your baby s room and it does not smell pleasant .
these folders are fine they re strong colorful etc . but what i didn t know but wondered about when i requested them from the vine program was that in order to use them efficiently you really need a hole punch and i might just order one i saw one on amazon for under because i think the folders will come in handy . i m a writer and a lot of times i file a printed hard copy of an article or chapters of a book and it would certainly be nice to have them bound into one of these folders . i tried to use my hole punch and i was able to make it work but it took some experimenting and you end up with a middle hole that you don t need to get the placement right . and then of course then you want to return to hole punching you have to re set the punches not a hassle if you remember to mark where they go but i didn t .anyway i won t gush about this product it s a folder . but if i had a hole punch already i d probably have used them all up by now . maybe someone will offer the punch via the vine program and wouldn t that be nice went together super easily with no tools ! !some other reviewers talked about this being flimsy and needing screws to put it together ? it seems that we didn t get the same product . these are really solid when assembled correctly . i suspect they didn t quite get the tabs into the right places when assembling .we ordered of these and they were packed very differently but both had the instructions . tip put the doors onto the back before putting this completed section into the bottom if you do that it fits perfectly tightly securely . there are little tabs that have to slide into each other and if you miss those i can see how it might be unstable .others also mentioned they wanted to do more than just keep the doors from opening by adding an actual padlock of some sorts . i cannot speak to this as we are actually using this in our laundry room so the latch that comes with it is plenty sufficient . i m not sure what good a lock would do because if someone really wanted to steal the contents they could either take the whole cabinet or just remove the top . this is plastic it s not a safe . maybe to keep kids out a padlock would be sufficient ?both of our units arrived with out any damage and i had them both assembled by myself in about minutes .we are stacking units and using them in our laundry room . love it . love it .super deal . i looked other places and found these exact cabinets for more money and i d have had to wrangle them into my car .i am sure we ll find more uses be ordering more in the future .growing up i always remembered my dad s two multi drawer storage cabinets and how he had thousands of screws nuts bolts washers and odds and ends in them . whenever we were working on a project or fixing something he d be able to tell me i need a machine bolt and i just grabbed the appropriately labeled drawer out of the cabinet and bring it to him .now that i have a house of my own i need a couple of these . one of my drawers had been filling up in the past year with tons of extra fasteners washers and odds and ends and i found myself sometimes buying more of a fastener i already had simply because it was difficult to sift through all the little baggies to find the fastener i needed .so i bought two of these stack on cabinets knowing they don t have dividers or labels in the box and got out my trusty p touch label maker . i put all my bits and pieces in different drawers labeling each one as i went and i can now find exactly what i m looking for when i need it ! stability ease of use at first i feared the all plastic construction would make drawers hard to use and before i had anything in the drawers they would slide or shift way too easily even if i just bumped the table the cabinet was placed on . however once i loaded all the drawers they were much more stable and the entire cabinet didn t move when the table was bumped . durability the construction of this cabinet is the same as my dad s old cabinet but his had a metal frame meaning it ll probably last through another century or two . the plastic used here may warp over time or become brittle so i m not expecting a century of use but it seems to be holding up well to pretty heavy use so far . the drawer guides are simple and allow for easy drawer removal just pull out then pull up the front of the drawer . size of drawers as you can tell by the picture the drawers are either small good for maybe red wire nuts or a couple hundred small screws or medium size good for a few locks some extra hardware from cabinetry or some outlets and switches . since i m storing mostly little things bolts screws nuts washers wire nuts electrical connectors etc . the drawers are the perfect size for me and the clear face of the drawers lets me attach a small label and still see through to what s inside .overall a great organizer for the price there are better options on amazon and elsewhere but nowhere near this price .
does what it does and has what it said .works good so far .buy it when you can have compatible staplersi type a lot every day for years . i don t have carpal tunnel but my wrists get sore . this is a good way to keep them in the proper position to avoid soreness . there are a few alternatives too and i ve tried most of them .this one has a nice comfortable wrist rest attached to a tiltable platform for a standard rectangular keyboard .alternatively you can just get the strip independently and place it in front of your keyboard mouse or both it comes in different lengths .these both work with a standard rectangular keyboard . if you prefer an ergonomic keyboard which i do it doesn t fit properly in this . options for that are a beaded wrist rest or smartgloves where you wear the beads on your wrist . i have found this last option to be best for me with an ergo keyboard .but for a simple rectangular keyboard and for a little extra support when typing this m gel wrist guard with platform is comfortable and simple and gives you a tilt option if your keyboard doesn t have onethe m tilt adjustable gel wrist rest platform alters the angle of your computer keyboard for more ergonomic typing . the package comes with the sturdy plastic platform anti microbial gel wrist pad and a sets of rubber feet . both the feet and the wrist rest attach to the platform via sticky double sided tape . you can decide between and degrees positive or negative incline but make sure you are happy with your choice because you are then stuck with your decision . actually you can later decide to go from to degrees if you aren t happy angle but you can t decide to go from a positive to negative incline .i found the keyboard platform to be easy to set up and am using it degrees positive . it feels durable and does not slip around on my wood desktop surface . currently on it is my imac s low profileapple aluminum keyboard and it is almost too small for the m unit . the wrist pad is comfortable but raises my hands higher over the low keyboard than i would like . i also tested alogitech k wave design and amicrosoft wireless comfort desktop keyboard . both fit on the m platform but were a little too large and their already ergonomic designs pushed the keys back too far from the gel wrist pad . this product is optimal for standard sized keyboards and is not a good solution for everyone . couple that with the extremely high price and i m not overly thrilled with it . if it were truly adjustable after the initial set up then i could perhaps justify the cost .it works well enough with my imac keyboard and does relieve some strain in my hands when using it but the m gel wrist rest platform is not a product i will purchase again and only would recommend it to computer users with specific requirements . kort
in the case of you change the guitar strings or in case you just make a revision setup this item is very useful because the guitar will be land and the her body will stay firmly attached .a string winder and cutter ! this is a tool to carry in your guitar case at all times ! it even has a peg puller for people who have pegs on their acoustic guitars . great quality product . . .i will buy another one for my uncle who performs weekly .if you own a guitar and just use this to change your strings it will be worth the investment . it protects your guitar from getting banged up and nicked up . supports the neck and guitar body perfectly to perform work on the guitar .
these are standard dividers with insertable tabs for labeling . they are exactly what you would expect . this is a good price for these which is currently . .these pendaflex file folders are the standard for office use with the added benefit that they are now made of recycled paper . they come in many different colors . i got the old fashioned standard green . they are letter size cut tabs .good quality . highly recommended .i am happy with these for the size . they could be made a little thicker and not so flimsy but they were cheap and the right size . it s hard to find envelopes this size that are white .
as a lot of epiphone owners have learned cases designed for the gibson es clones won t fit epiphone guitars as the epiphones have a slightly larger headstock . this case however fits my dot custom like a glove . the padding is perfect the top is arched to precisely fit the guitar and the build quality is better than you might expect at this price level .this is a great value . i contacted the company for measurements inside the case to see if it would fit an ibanez rg series . it fits perfectly . thank youthe fender mini electric guitar stand is not made for the fender squire mini guitar . the guitar falls through . i will have to buy a differant stand for him rendering this one useless . the fender stand for standard guitars will not work on the size ether .
if you have all prong plugs then this will work perfectly . if you have prong plugs or plugs with adapters be prepared to rearrange your electronics because they won t all fit in this product . i haven t found anything better though .i bought this at babies r us . it did not fit my rail . it says it fits most standard rails but doesn t give any measurements . how are you supposed to know if it will fit unless you purchase it ? what a pain .the head support doesnt fit to my car seat . my baby head is squeeze and i guess it only fit in the stroller . i like the touch of it but i have to return it .
at less then this is a steal ! the unit is well made and really does a nice job . it s far bettter then the round adapter that plugs straight in and that on the back side you plug in the amp cord . the degree amp plug emliminates the problem of the cord pulling out or partially disconnecting from the outlet .this piece fits on the battery on your car truck bike and connects to cable from battery tender have this on all my equipt toys for quick hook up .the rd generation powerprobe includes a number of changes for additional flexibility . in short it is a vehicle powered dvm with both a foot cable and an additional foot extension giving you a foot working range around either the battery terminals or cigarette lighter outlet both clips and a plug are included in the kit .with the series units they use a hard gold plated banana jack to hold the removable probe or cables to extend your reach . if you purchase the accessory kit it includes piercing probes that self center on a conductor pierce the insulation and attach to the jack allowing you to tap a wire at any point to locate intermittant problems .while the dvm is backlit all the time it also has bright white leds facing forward to aid in finding and probing terminals in dark places . the actual probe is hardgold plated with a sharp tip and removable at the banana jack . another identical probe is included with a screw in female banana jack in the accessories kit to retrofit the powerprobe i and ii units to accept external cables and probes .if you need to excite a circuit with a connection to battery ground or to battery positive the switch allows a momentary connection to bridge the probe tip to either voltage which is useful in testing relay driven circuits indicator lights and other small current loads . the prope voltage is always displayed during testing on the meter . the voltage ground switch is circuit breaker protected in case you accidentally drive volts into a chassis ground . additionally since the switch takes abuse it is easily replaced if it fails with just a screwdriver .combined with the testlead set the powerprobe greatly simplifies testing of vehicular wire and big rigs up to a single trailer . the dvm has selectable modes of operation designed for different problems . reading the manual is important to get the full value from this meter .although the price is a little high the design and construction quality are excellent . enough wire is provided to check running lights on trailers or to look for blown fuses . all of the wiring is exceptionally flexible and heavily insulated with top quality connectors . both the tester and accessories come in hard plastic cases that can be stowed in a service box .not mentioned in specifications is that although the probe runs from vdc the meter can be used to measure voltages up to vdc .
i bought it for a new aquarium i am setting up . i haven t set it up yet but it looks like exactly what i neededwhen i ordered this filter it was with fsss . free super saver shipping it was well worth it and i am happy to aannounce it came with upright bubblers like i was wishing for ! ! ! i recommend this to anyone with a foot long fish tank . or gallons it should fit well . stars this works well although i will say my pump didn t ! this stone put out maybe streams of bubbles ! so i bought a better pump and tried this product again . much better . i got a pump rated for a g tank instead of my g pump . i will say that i get an even stream of bubbles now although i wouldn t say they are super fine bubbles . they aren t as many small as the picture but it still looks nice .i will say i tried to connect this to another stone and it didn t work . again i think i should have gone up to a g pump to connect two and have them work but in reality they didn t connect together well so i m not sure if it would have really worked in the end anyway .
goes with mower yearly tuneup .the only problem i had was the bottle had a small hole in it . the box and other items i had ordered were soaked in oil . the bottle had leaked oz .while the product applies to the purpose it serves the packaging is very misleading . don t judge it by the capacity of its bottle size because the content is only half the dimension of the bottle . it leaves the person scratching his her head wondering if the volume within is half empty or half full . it goes by weight but then why use such a large bottle besides it is unsealed giving the impression that you get a good deal based on the volume . i know the review should only be for the product but the packaging is very misleading .i love royal purple and have used it for years now . i fail to understand how packaging of quarts of product offers a cheaper customer quart than a gallon container . from someone who comes from a manufacturing of consumer goods job this pricing structure is bogus . had the pricing been better for the gallon on a per quart basis i would have rated my purchase of the gallon a star .
this cover is very soft love the way it feels . . . so far it hasn t stained . i m very pleased with it . it is somewhat easy to see through . . . not a big deal for me because my boppy is a pink gingham check so pink on top looks fine . i can see where you wouldn t want to put this over some of the boppy prints .they advertise it or it shows if you search for soft spout and they are hard . they are probably a good option to convert your bottles into sippy cups but my son did not like them . i think also it does not help that they are green so he paid even more attention that they looked different .these dont spill and i have been using them for mts not really tossing them straws are thick and durable . colors are nice .
i wish i d had this when i was pregnant . but i have it now and it has come in very handy . i don t use it all the time but it s very comfortable when i do . i use it a lot more with our glider when i m pumping or just rocking the baby . i wouldn t buy it until you see if you need it .i knew a cosleeper was a must when i found out i was having twins . i talked with many other mom s of twins and they also confirmed that a cosleeper was necessary . i followed other people suggestions and used the directions on the website to put it together and it was pretty easy . i put it together by myself and i was months pregnant with twins so that s saying something . i looked back at the directions that were included in it and it would have been much more difficult . it is sturdy and exactly what i imagined it to be . it is a tad heavy to move around and so i wish it was a little lighter . overall i am totally happy with it and would buy it again .i really should ve read the reviews on this but i didn t see how i could go wrong . it s described very well and the pictures really sell it . i think i may have gotten one of the defective ones because the arms that i got did not look like the arms in the instruction booklet . there was not sufficient space and they were too close together in length . once i put it together there was no way to fit it onto my table without possibly breaking it or the table . it stuck at a ridiculouly high angle and would not go any further . i hope i have better luck with the next brand i try because i hate the tall rolling highchair that we got as a present . for now i am content with the bumbo . amazon is going to take it back as defective and refund me the shipping .
this is one the best oil filters on the market for the harley davidson motorcycles . i use these filters on my harley davidson fatboy motorcycle because they do a great job in filtering my oil . the oil filter on my harley is mounted on the front of the engine . this location plus the fact the crank position sensor is in the way of using most oil filter wrenches you have to buy a special wrench which will slip in use to remove the oil filter . this oil filter has a mm nut welded on end of the filter housing this makes installing or removing the oil filter very easy . you don t have to worry about damaging your engine crank position sensor which are expensive to replace . i highly recommend this great k n performance oil filter for any harley davidson motorcycle owner who uses regular or synthetic motor oil . great price and it s chrome plated to boot .don t waste your money on fram filters . mann filters will not fail you if you plan on a long oil interval in excess of k miles .fit my e i perfectly . it also came with the correct o ring to seal the oil filter housing . just buy it already !the k n performance gold oil filter is the best for racing because . the nut welded to the end makes removal quick and easy . . drilled safety wire holes for racing . . metal leaf spring provides a positive leak proof seal between element and lid . . thicker walls and end plate gives over psi bursting strength . . resin impregnated filter media provides maximum filtering surface for contaminant removal . . steel inner core provides extra structural support to prevent filter collapse . . bearing saver anti drainback valve eliminates dry starts . . rolled threads provide protection against stripping . . leak proof double rolled seam . . internally lubricated gasket allows easy installation and removal . . unaffected by racing fuels mtbe and e . . low pressure drop flows gallons per minute .no other automotive oil filter meets these specs but like all other things that seem too good to be true the k n performance gold has major drawbacks . the same micron filtering ability that allows those super high flow rates also means that the oil filter is only k n s numbers efficient . . that efficiency also means that the filter allows larger dirt particles to remain in the oil and you re stretching your luck by running the k n oil filters for more than miles . that super duper synthetic juice isn t any good when it s full of dirt so the advantages of long life synthetic oils are lost on the k n s high flow rate capacity .once again we re looking at a trade off if you need the k n s racing advantages more than you need the mile filter change intervals then the k n is perfect for you .if you need to use synthetic oils and go for the longer change intervals i suggest a different brand of oil filter .the bosch premium oil filter that crosses to the k n hp is also made in the usa . it doesn t have the hi flow features of a k n but the bosch filtech filtration media advertises a efficiency and can go for miles with api sn ilsac dexos approved full synthetic oil w pennzoil platinum . remember that a high efficiency filter will clog sooner so pushing your oil filter for more than miles is neither prudent nor thrifty . actually stupid is what it is ! ! you cannot repair the damage done by a clogged oil filter by replacing the filter ! !for extended oil and filter change intervals mobil offers an extended life oil filter that s made just for extended service synthetic oils but is not available due to size restrictions for all vehicles . there is a mobil extended life oil filter available that crosses with the k n hp the bosch and the motorcraft s . the mobil extended life filter is m non racing applications of today s modern gasoline engine specifications can best be met with the use of full synthetic oils that meet the latest api sn ilsac and dexo specs . the api sn designation allows for use in all gasoline engines including supercharged and turbocharged gasoline engines from all manufacturers .if you re wondering just which is the best oil for your particular vehicle go to the mobil website and look for the best oil for my car tab . answer a few questions about your engine and they ll give you the correct viscosity specifications according to their manufacturers data base .use whatever brand of oil that you want it s the api ilsac specifications and the proper viscosity of the oil that matters most .the old myths of thicker oil lubricates better and more detergent means less oil are long gone the new synthetic formulations have made it easy for anyone to have the best lubrication available .selecting the right lubes and filters for your driving requirements is an important part of vehicle ownership .good luck ! !
the product arrived quite fast and was packages well . i opened it and i used it for my g tropical aquarium i read many good things about seachem so i gave it a go i have sand substrate and put two in there just because i only had plants that i thought need root tabs the rest should be fine with the liquid seachem fert i had to be picky of what i buy because i have african dwarf frogs so they don t react well to fertilizer . they seem fine and happy ! hopefully my plants will flourish di am usually a diehard canister filter user for my aquariums but when setting up a couple of small tanks at home a gallon salt and a gallon fresh i wanted to try a power filter again . while i used to use power filters when i first started in the hobby about years ago i moved to canisters due to their versatility and ability to handle a larger bio load . the appeal of the aquaclears was that they were reputed to be quiet as well as have some versatility in their media capacity . they are well reviewed on aquarist sites such as planted tank .net and others so i thought i d give them a try . after a few months i m very satisfied . while i still want canisters for my heavier stocked tanks they aquaclears have worked well and they are very affordable . a recommended product .i purchased this to keep on hand for my tropical freshwater fish tanks a gallon a gallon and a gallon quarantine hospital tank . so far i haven t had to use it but the reviews from amazon and elsewhere wer helpful about it as was comments on aquarium websites . shipping from amazon was prompt as usual . when i do use this i will update my review about it . price was right . i am very fastidious about the health and care of my fish . i always receive comments on healthy my fish look and act . i move around a lot due to my career so i m always setting up and taking down tank every two four years a so . i give me fish away to good homes or back to the fish store i originally purchased them from . my latest batch i had consisted on black widow tetras and albino tetras . normal life span for them is about two years . i had my fish for over three years and lost one the largest and oldest the day i was about to tear down the tank . i d say that attests to my tank rountine . of course it helps that i always understock my tank . overall considering what it is supposed to do i m glad i was able to find it for the day i might need it .
notice in the name guitar input . this is not to be confused with the amplitube irig which achieves input and output through the ipad ios devices headphone jack . headphone connections can be noisy and have reliable connection problems . they also depend on the built in ad da converters in the ipad ios device . this apogee jam k is a professional quality input device that has dedicated a d analogue to digital converter but depends on the built in hardware of the ipad ios device for playback . on the other hand apogee one has both ad and da convertors for both input and output .amplitube irig from ik multimedia has a simple stereo headphone in and out jack plug that plugs into your ipad . the built in hardware in the ipad is something that i love for doing something like watching a movie cozying up to the inch screen but for audio phile quality you need a dedicated a dedicated pre and ad convertor and that is what this apogee jam k has . mind you it has that for audio recording input but playback is handled via your headphone jack on your ipad . you can of course just use that for monitoring your mix and then save the file in a digital format internally and send to a playback device with pristine digital audio quality e .g . saving as a .wav file . this makes the apogee k jam a very usable device to achieve high quality recordings at a very nice price .so here it the continuum . amplitube irig for headphone jack input and output quality built into your ipad etc . the apogee jam k for digital quality conversion on input only with playback being handled by headphone jack on ipad . the apogee one on the other hand at roughly times the price gives you both ad da conversions so it has its own audio output jack plus tracks of recording either instrument and or a balanced external microphone jack . it also comes with a built in condenser mic that is pretty amazing . it also has volt phantom power for using your favorite condenser mic . when you get into the apogee duet and quartet you get more connections plus the all too important option of midi connectivity .this product has a mono microphone input and a stereo headphone output . it is meant for connecting a headset to a usb port . since the headset has a mono microphone this adapter works great . the drivers automatically install on microsoft operating systems . this product is great for using a soft phone or other communications program . the windows systems remembers volume settings each time it is connected . i imagine that you could use something other than a headset with this but it was mainly built for a headset . works seemless and great with a headset .this is a great little keyboard for use with garageband on the ipad . garageband recognizes it as a controller for the keyboard smart keyboard sampler smart guitar smart bass and drums . you can even solo on the akai keyboard while the smart keyboard autoplays an accompaniment ! in addition to offering the superior feel of a real keyboard this akai keyboard has much more consistent touch sensitivity than what s built into garageband for ipad .unlike other keyboard controllers i ve tried this one plugs and plays with the ipad no powered usb hub required . you do need apple s camera connection kit of course to add a usb port to your ipad . it s not loaded with gimmicks just the essentials and the essentials work very well indeed . the keys are of standard width which is large enough for fumble free playing . it s lightweight compact and thus perfectly suited as an ipad accessory .
came in oversized boxes but were packaged securely and easy to set up and hold my guitar and bass right out of the box works right out of the box . easy to read easy to use . . . . . .arrived very fast inexcellent shape . . . .just had to put the supplied battery into itthe one spot works very nicely for a pedal board chain . everything needed came with the combo making it ready to go right out of the box .
i bought of these and hung fender strats on my wall . comes with all the mounting screws and anchors needed to mount properly . couldn t be happier with this product .you get more than enough screws to install a front pickguard and a tremolo on your stratocaster however this lacks the two longer screws near the bridge on the front pickguard . other than the two missing screws this hardware is a great replacement for any missing or oxidized hardware on your stratocaster .i have of these hanging on my wall with different types of guitars banjos and mandolins .they attach to the wall with screws . hardware is included to attach those screws to drywall . it takes about a inch hole in the drywall where a large screw shaped plastic piece is inserted into the drywall and then the regular screws go into the plastic .the piece that touches the guitar has some sort of silicone rubber which protects the instrument . the holder can be bent in or out a bit to better fit the instrument that you have .i have moved a couple of times and these can be removed and attached again .very sturdy well made product .
of all the battery chargers on the market the battery tender is the best . the device is small and portable works exceptionally well for maintaining batteries and does not over charge over charging can decrease the overall life of your battery . it is simple to operate and can be left hooked up to a dormant battery while it is not in use . the battery tender can be used while the battery is hooked up to a vehicle mower etc . or not . highly recommended . i comparison shop a lot before buying anything hopefully you can benefit from my time investment and review .i am very pleased with this battery maintainer . i purchased the cigarette light plug along with this unit and it is so easy to use . i plugged it in set it to normal charge and brought a totally discharged battery back to life . the battery is holding the charge just fine and i couldn t be happier . i especially like the supply mode on this unit so i can change out a battery without losing the codes on my car . no one should be without this charger . i have a car that sits in the garage and used sparingly and this device keeps the battery fully charged .i have used this charger many times to charge the battery in a car that sits outside and i rarely drive . the voltage and percent charge display is very nice . very easy to use
this clamp on pair of miniature lamps does an excellent job of illuminating music set lists and notes . the manufacturer claims lumens of light which is roughly equivalent to a watt bulb but the lens and the way the light is diffused make them seem much brighter . since the design keeps the light somewhat directional they are relatively discreet and will not interfere with others on the stage in the studio or in the audience .the three batteries will last hours of continuous use according to the spec sheet and that is in the ballpark of the use time i am getting between battery changes .what i love is the dual heads each on a gooseneck that is over a foot long . the length gives you a lot of flexibility no pun intended for placing the lights exactly where you want them . the goosenecks easily bend and stay in whatever position you bend them to . the clamp is perfect for most stands and has a layer of padding to prevent marring surfaces . the manufacturer claims that this light can be used free standing . frankly that is a stretch and i would recommend a light designed with a larger base if that is what you are really looking for . this one does work beautifully clamped to music stands and the illumination will cover both pages of a chart .i can see this strap lasting a long time . i love how i don t need new strap buttons considering that the screws may be smaller than the original strap button screws which facilitates the strap button falling out and your guitar smacks the limestone floor ! .you can lock each strap button with one hand great product !i use this with fairly light mics seenady dmk drum mic packagefor details .while i generally do not mic bass drums when i do this stand allows me to do it my way which may seem unconventional to some folks . i place the mic on the batter side of the drum about three feet back . since this can be problematic with the floor tom and throne and hi hat hindering access the boom and adjustability of this stand are a great help .where the stand shines if micing amps . some small amps such as thefender champion electric guitar amplifierare usually placed on a raised surface to keep them off the floor . this stand will reach any stand that is chair seat height . for larger amps that are on the floor or tiltback stands this mic stand will still allow you to position the mic where you need it .my use is relatively narrow kick drums and amps . but for each this stand is excellent in my opinion . with the mics i am using it is heavy enough to remain stable and for where i need to place those mics it allows me to do so with relative ease .
bought this for my honda crv . fit perfectly and cleared the code . easy to do just give the threads some wd bought this to take the o sensor off my honda crv . worked great . long enough and fit like a glove .exactly what was offered fit nicely no major prep work won t fade or crack adjusts perfectly easy removal and fits under seat in truck
very thin and flimsy plastic . dropped them . several cracked and the lead in the others broke into pieces . what a waste .nothing like ordering a new pencil and getting one with a sticker on it thrown in a sizable box with some air packets like it is some sort of second hand item or return ?upon analyzing the pencil the first thing i noted was that where the clip mechanism locks into the barrel it is held by a plastic recess . . .this metal clip being opened and closed a lot upon plastic material just does not bode well for the plastic parts . upon taking the tip off and the grip there is plastic threads and plastic barrel underneath a metal skin . pretty much a metal veneer of sorts all along this pencil . i would think metal on plastic threads would not tend to hold up for a long length of time . my conclusion is this pencil while looking quite nice on the exterior the quality and durability of basically plastic guts just will not stand the test of time . i see pentel selling lots of these due to the durability issues sadly another company that has always made products i have used and liked over the years has stepped quality down a notch . the design of plastic plastic threading click mechanism being used against metal just defies common sense to me . they should have went the step further and maybe charged a buck or two more for a far superior product .pencil is nice heavy weight feel to it the cap is a gorgeous color however the back half of the pencil is a cheapo plastic that does not even come close to being the same color as the metal cap . they should have made it the same material . this is an expensive pencil and should be made of metal not half plastic .
what can you say these are mailing labels for large envelopes or packages . they are plain white come in sheets of ten with the usual supporting formats in office suites and online at the avery website . the one key aspect of these labels that makes them different from the standard labels is the trueblock that masks any text that they are laid over no more seeing through the label to the prior addressee .as far as i am concerned these labels fulfill all of the claims made by avery and work splendidly . p i ve bought a lot of labels over the years and i find that the original dymo brand labels are always the nicest brightest whitest . if you want nice bright white labels this is the best option in my opinion .avery labels are my favorite brand of labels . the work great on my laser printer . i use these to label my catalogs and other business supplies .
when they call these binder clips mini they mean mini . i wasn t expecting the huge . or . inch binder clips but i was expecting something that would do more than paper clips .just be warned if you are looking for something smaller than those huge binder clips but not mini hence the name buy the medium size .if you are looking for something to hold papers . better than paper clips these are perfect for you .these are quality labels that yield a professional look . they also have a perforated backing paper that bends making them easier to remove from the sheets . if you re looking for a really small no nonsense label that sells with plenty in a pack this product might be for you .however i personally feel they re a little too small for practical use . it s difficult to fit more than three lines of text on this size label and still have it be large enough to read . the typical return address is three to four lines . the largest i can make the common font times new roman is . point in order to fit three lines of text on a label . fitting four lines requires going down to only . . a typical font size is to point . while there s nothing wrong with these labels i prefer using shipping labels as return address labels . using a larger sized label allows users to fit four lines of text a larger font size or even a piece of clip art . while this small size is functional and fuss free and one print yields an impressive labels legibility is sacrificed when labels are this small .bubble mailers are nicely made good thickness . good size for sending jewelry or other smaller parts like lego etc . . . they would hold multiple smaller pieces with no problem as they are about the size of my hand a normal women s hand inside packing area wise long wide . they are easily sealed . envelopes are blank on outside so you re able to customize them as needed for mailing . i got boxes of these each came in a small brown packing box inside the larger order box which makes it nice for storage . was shipped quickly .
they do work . exactly as advertised . hane no fear on buying these . fit the chevy silverado wt tailgate rods .works great . fairly easy swap . just be aware the front window regulators are the same on whether you have a suburban or tahoe or one of their gm family members . not so for the rear regulators . the full size suvs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones . the vehicle input feature amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference . the pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at but the vehicle id feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit . beware ! ! ! ! just so you know the dorman and fit the full size and the and fit the tahoe size vehicles .fits my john deere lawn tractor which is model la and likely it fits all the l la and d series lower end john deere tractors . please post a comment if it does not and i ll update this reviewcurrently amazon says it does not fit my third generation miata nc but it doesthese filters come top in most online filter tests and i use them in almost all my cars
based upon condition of your wheels the cleaner does require some elbow scrubbing but does a descent job . hope this helps .i was hoping to use the clay bar to remove water spots on a new truck but the one provided with this mequiar s kit was worthless for this purpose . the kit does include everything you need to apply the products in the kit which is a plus and probably the reason the kit is so popular .a good buy . does the same job that the honda oem part does .
these transparent dividers are a perfect addition for those big binders students need for college classes . loose leaf hand outs and other flyers are easily protected and easily accessible this way . the plastic makes these harder to rip from the holes too . the colored tabs make these easier to divide by topic .the size is a standard binder size so these dividers don t stick out from the rest of the binder and create a bulky appearance .this is a plain white binder with three rings that snap open . it says it is pvc free which i assume is a good thing . the binder is sturdy and a convenient size to keep notebook paper in . this also works will with clear plastic three hole sheets as a photo album . i have used several of these to hold our collection of ancient family photos which had been in such old albums that they were disintegrating . one and a half inches is a small size which is easy to manage and hold on my lap to look at photos and this is the best size for your sales presentation binders also as it doesn t intimidate or overwhelm your client when you show this to him .these insert able tab dividers are perfect for book reports office organization or creating training manuals . they are yellow in color and have the standard three hole punches in them . they fit into any standard binder and they have a plastic strip that runs along the hole punches so the paper doesn t rip . the paper is strong and not fragile at all . there are eight dividers and each one has it s own color and it comes with white labels .
exactly what was offered fit nicely no major prep work won t fade or crack adjusts perfectly easy removal and fits under seat in truckworks just like it needs to . perfect fit for the tailgate on my chevy when the oem clip busted .great fit
product description on this page does not disclose that this product contains rosemary used as a natural preservative . unfortunately in my experience most cats do not like rosemary . additionally there is some controversy whether rosemary is even safe for cats to ingest as cat biology cannot handle most plant essential oils safely . dogs should have no problem with this same salmon oil is sold for both dogs and cats just different packaging but i would look elsewhere if you have cats . amazon customer service processed a return credit for me on this item with no issues one of the reasons i like shopping here so much ! thanks amazon ! ! !seachem products are outstandingly some of the best support chemicals and additives available to the aquarist . you can be assured that with this purchase the product will perform exactly as described and it will be misty of all safe to use .this stuff i trust with my life it does everything it says on the bottle and more seachem is the only company i will trust to help my fish out when it comes to chemicals
if you need a tube screamer . you can t go wrong with the ts . the only reason why you shouldn t get it is if it isn t the right tone for you . i say this because you can t say anything bad about this pedal . it sounds amazing . it just might not be your sound . i personally went with the ts because it compliments my amp better than the ts . people who say this is better than the ts or vice versa are choosing the wrong wording . they prefer it . it s not better . both are great .if you need a tube screamer . you can t go wrong with the ts . the only reason why you shouldn t get it is if it isn t the right tone for you . i say this because you can t say anything bad about this pedal . it sounds amazing . it just might not be your sound . i personally went with the ts because it compliments my amp better than the ts . people who say this is better than the ts or vice versa are choosing the wrong wording . they prefer it . it s not better . both are great .i own a gls es and am very happy with it so when i need a mic for my guitar cab i went with a gls and couldn t be happier . these mics are very solid and i can t tell them from the real deal . i have done side by side comparison of both the real and knock off mics and unless you are some kind of sonic freak i doubt you would notice any difference . i am about to purchase three more of these mics for the rest of the bands intruments .
this cover does not fit a full size acoustic electric hohner guitar . i measured the whole at but this cover does not even come close to fitting ! it measures in diameter so check your guitar closely !this product works as advertised but you should beware . these are right angled and they will not fit in a lot of pedals including the crybaby wah .you have been warned ! ! !this is a great value . i contacted the company for measurements inside the case to see if it would fit an ibanez rg series . it fits perfectly . thank you
based on reading many reviews i assume the deminsions listed for this product are incorrect . amazon you must change according to many people it is a flat matt not inches thick as lsited in the dimensions x x inches .when purchasing this kitty kap patented you are receiving one cap . others have mentioned it and i will post pictures .this is a good cap for the larger . ounce cans and i have not tried it for the smaller cans but it should work . i paid nearly . for the top but i thought i was getting two of them . i hope the seller will make it clearer that the buyer is receiving only one .the plastic is thick and durable and the design with the ridges to fit every can seem to be reasonable . i did want to make note that there was a sticker inside the lid that states intended for pets only keep out of the reach of children ? ? ? ? what about covering a can of human food . . . is that a problem ?why ? does it have something to do with lead content in the plastic ? if so please state this . why the warning or clarification sticker make this clear in the description .the product seems nice but i am giving it three stars for the amazon presentation the outlandish price and the warning sticker .keeping them honest .should have went with the xl would have been nice if dimensions were given in product discription but i can live with it . .
this is working for me quite well and is part of my keyboard stage rig now .i m mounting it to a heavy duty on stage brand double x stand . the resulting arrangement is reasonably stable although if you put a bit of pressure on the mic stand you can rotate the attachment bar . i could tighten the handle further to prevent this but am worried that this will begin to deform the x stand and it is not a problem on stage . i am not worried that it would damage the attachment bar as it is quite heavy duty .in general it s strong enough to hold a typical stage mic on a small boom arm .base is heavy and sturdy so your mics won t topple over . but an arm on it and that could be a different story . the action on the height adjust was a little finicky for me but not enough for me to worry about . while i appreciate the weight of the base i do kind of wish there was a lighter solution to keeping it stable with a heavy mic mounted on an angle .this is a well made table top stand . the weight of the stand holds the mic and wire in place with ease . i would get this stand again .
as a lot of epiphone owners have learned cases designed for the gibson es clones won t fit epiphone guitars as the epiphones have a slightly larger headstock . this case however fits my dot custom like a glove . the padding is perfect the top is arched to precisely fit the guitar and the build quality is better than you might expect at this price level .fits very well on my les paul at first it look small for my guitar but it fits perfectly with my epiphone lp les paul electric guitar
the samson shock mount does work with the audio technica at yes . does it work well ? if you can securely close the little gap between the at and the shock mount then yes . there is another reviewer on here who gives a very good tip on getting rid of that rattle when using this mount with the at . only other thing is that the colors don t really match up well but i don t really care its a good shock mount .ask yourself before you buy though do i really need one ? i don t really use mine since i have carpet on the floors that doesn t like the mic stand shake too much .so i decided to amplify my martin dreadnaught a really really nice acoustic guitar . i didn t want to spend a lot if it just wouldn t sound good with a pickup and saw this had consistently good ratings . i can t speak for other acoustic pickups but this far exceeded my expectations and i don t plan on buying a more expensive piezo or soundhole pickup .attaching itunfortunately the narrow portion of the barrel is not long enough to fit through the end tail block and i didn t want to drill a new hole in my not so cheap guitar just to test out a relatively cheap pickup .so i attached the pickup in the regular position inside the body behind the bridge and just ran the cable out from the sound hole . the jack is held onto the pickguard with some scotch outdoor mounting tape which is kind of like really strong gum it can be removed without leaving sticky residue which holds it in place well enough to plug in a cable and move around as long as i don t jerk the guitar quickly .sound qualityi plugged it into my cheap regular guitar amp and whoa ! the package mentions two locations you can place the pickup and because i needed to run it through the sound hole i could only place it where more treble is picked up . so i have to compensate on my amp by turning down the treble to or lowerbecause the pickup is a transducer no electrical feedback interference is picked up so the sound will be very clear and crisp . it would probably sound even better on an amp with better electric shielding the only noise i get even at max gain max input volume is from the amp itself heard with every instrument i plug into it if i turn the master volume up too high .another thing to consider is that transducers pickup vibrations so it won t pick up sound when placed a millimeter away from the guitar body but will when touching it . so with that in mind the pickup will strongly output every sound you make to the guitar body like it brushing up against your body a zipper hitting the guitar your fingers sliding on the strings etc .the mounting process was simple .recommendation buy a cheap magnetic stud finder if you don t already have one . you don t want your instrument plummeting to the floor !i got a stud finder off amazon and mounted two of these hangers . they re holding up very well . the backs of the guitars are practically flush with the wall . whether that s a good thing . . .is up to you . i guess i don t have to worry about it potentially swinging into the wall as much if it were bumped . so maybe it is a good thing .be careful when you hang it though . it could definitely hit the wall if you don t place it on the hanger carefully .
this collar does what it is suppose to do . i apparently didn t read about the battery replacement but you can t just go buy one like i can the other bark collar i have . it ueses a battery that is built in to the lid of the battery connection . i don t want to have to wait for a new battery to arrive by mail when i need one . with my other bark collar i can find those batteries just about any place i go .this is one of those products that you hope you never have to use or take advantage of . but it s a great idea that more manufacturers should get involved with .azoo also offers a similar battery backup unit for about plus they have a self contained ac battery combo pump for continuous use which recharges its volt battery priced at about .one reviewer complained that the power cord didn t work and that his unit only functioned with battery power . news flash ! ! that s the way it s supposed to work ! ! this is a battery backup unit ! !the way it works is simple ac power holds a relay open . when ac power fails the relay closes and completes the battery circuit to power the pump . the power cord serves only to keep the relay open not to power the pump .unlike as in other reviews here the unit i have isn t all that noisy maybe it s a new model . the one thing i don t like about it is a stupidly short power cord only inches ! ! not good for mounting more than inches or so away from the aquarium or high on a wall to prevent backflow . make sure you install a check valve in the air line . also you should know the included air line is way too short .recommended for emergency use . stars . .this is perfect for a backup system for your aquarium . plug it into an outlet put batteries in and then it will turn on automatically when the power is out to that outlet . i plugged mine into the same power strip my filter runs off of so if the filter stops the bubbles will start and save the fish .runs a bit loud but that s to be expected from an emergency backup system . i actually like that it makes noise so you can be alerted that it s running right away so you know something wrong with the power to the tank .takes d batteries but can run on a single battery . i didn t notice a change in output with one vs . two batteries so i m guessing one battery just runs out quicker than with two .as an included bonus you can use this air pump to aid in transporting fish long distances .
i wanted to make sure people understand what they are buying here .this purigen ml comes in its own bag you do not need a seperate bag to hold the purigen as with the other sizes so keep this in mind .this product helps lower nitrates ammonia nitrites . good stuff for the price . it is also reusable you can regenerate it by following the directions .awesome it does the job it does what we needed it to do . we do plan to buy it again .don t bother with any other testing methods or strips . get this kit and learn how to use it . then you can buy refill bottles when you need to . i wouldn t trust anything else .
this is so perfect in so many ways he can watch tv he can play i can breastfeed him or just take a nappy with me . love it ! easy to fold and use . i take to my son s daycare so that he can use his own swing and i can take it home with us . it is sturdy and very soft .this is easy to clean doesn t take up space and can travel easily with you . we like it a lot .
described as part of the sustainable forestry initiative these are letter size pressboard office folders . the spine expandable to is reinforced with tape billed as tyvek . the folder has a metal paper fastener inserted through perforations on both front and back about a half inch down from the top . there is a slightly smaller inner cardboard folder permanently attached to the outer folder also reinforced along the spine . this inner folder which functions as a pair of dividers also has a metal fastener attached to the top of both sides of each divider for a total of six fasteners . a two hole punch is useful to make the most of the fasteners .the index tabs on the outer folders are all in roughly the center position . the inner dividers also have tabs one at the middle position and the other at the lower position .these folders are neat in appearance strong and useful for storing and organizing paperwork whether or not you want to punch holes and use the fasteners . they are much less bulky than a three ring binder and keep things orderly . the different bright colors make it fast and easy to grab the one you need .this is a . mm lead pencil . it is machined metal in construction and has a drafting instrument feel . the point indeed has a very long non retracting sleeve to stabilize the lead so that you can use templates rules french curves and other drafting tools with this pencil . the grip section has both cross hatched machining and rubberized interior providing both a strong hold and yet a softer grip . the grip section rotates with a small window to allow you to indicate which hardness of lead you have loaded . it comes with hb leads . the point section retracts fully by activating the pocket clip so it is truly pocket friendly . the first button press long push extends the point section and subsequent shallower pushes extend the lead . pulling out the button reveals a small fixed length eraser of small diameter this short length is somewhat limiting for erasing on the road but your dedicated desk eraser will probably be used in a workspace . the pocket clip is excellent it is spring hinged so that it works like an alligator clip and has two somewhat pointed tips that securely grip the fabric of a shirt pocket . but the long travel of the clip allows you to attach the pencil to a pile of papers a notebook a cable or whatnot . with a better eraser especially a twist up type it would easily be a five star pencil .this is a nice binder good size easy to open . the nice thing is that there are extra pockets instead of one on a side there are overlapping enabling you to fit in more .
this review is for the second version of this calculator the slightly larger grey black and white model with a rounded mound housing the keypad . i had actually ordered the older model the light grey model with the blue and white keys slightly smaller which i had had previously but sadly lost . i had considered returning this newer model but finally decided against it as it is now listed as being discontinued by the manufacturer so if i returned the newer one i did get i very well might have gotten the same model back . . . . . . . . . .i was at first extremely disappointed in the newer model . why both the newer model and the older model which look completely different have the very same model number is completely beyond me . i mean people who work at texas instruments are supposed to be very intelligent and know what they are doing . . . .but why they decided to give to truly different calculators the same model number is something i don t think i ll ever understand . i mean . . .what kind of genuis makes this very simple mistake ? one who wants to fool online and catalogue buyers who have to trust that the packers will pack the right model perhaps that said this newer model though larger and more than slightly bulkier than the older one does have a few advantages . . . .i think .i don t remember the older model having a tax or tax or rate key nor do i remember it having a battery backup as the newer model does .this newer model has a nice little compartment for the battery which need only be opened with a single screw . so the entire back of the calculator need not be taken off with the slight dangers therein of getting dust into the machine or disturbing the delicate circuitry in the half a minute or so that it takes to change the battery . with a neat little separate oompartment for the battery changing the rest of the back of the machine need not be disturbed at all !this is all the more important as more and more calculators sadly are made with no user replaceable batteries enclosed no one is instructed in these other still newer calculators to take them to the nearest authorized repair shop of the designated manufacturer and have them replaced there like wrist watch batteries ! first wrist watches now calculators ! talk about planned obsolence ! buy even this newer model sv and keep it close ! although the newer model sv has a wrap around windshield numberical display instead of what is to me the far more esthetically pleasing and clearer picture frame numberical display found in the older model sv the numbers still are well spaced and clear to view . it also has the nice l a r g e numberic display which is not only on this newer model sv but also on the older model sv . . . . .and also on the belated dearly loved and sadly lost original texas instrument model no sv which i once had and enjoyed more than both of the sv models put together ! it was small handy and a beautiful medium bone yellow in colour . it also seemed to stay on forever pr at least an hour or so if i remember correctly . oh that texas instruments would bring that model back sigh ! well this new m del sv though not the older handier model sv nor the original model still has many good points most of which are delineated above . it is also a desk top model which can be carried in a pocket book if necessary and also in a briefcase but not in a wallet . it is bigger than the two previous models in the texas instrument line . . .but does have that priceless customer replacable battery chamber . although i do prefer the previous two models this newer one now available is not a bad little calculator all things considered .but i would still welcome greatly ! the return of the original model and or the original sv .i received this inch model for review from amazon . i already own the same trimmer but in the inch model . they re both the same except for the size .the trimmer is mostly plastic and feels lightweight but it stays stable when cutting and is solidly built . the lightness of the unit is actually a plus for me sincce i keep it in the closet until i need it . it s easy to move around .assembly is easy you basically slot the arm in and you re ready to go . i use my inch model about once a week . i cut about five sheets at a time to make sure the cut is straight but i think you could get away with up to . the same is true for the inch model .i d give five stars to this unit if it were just a bit less expensive . but compared to a wooden cutter the price is reasonable . if i were using the cutter more often and to cut more than paper say thicker paper or cardboard stock i d think about getting a more sturdy model . but with this model the blade stays sharp and is more than adequate for paper cutting .this is not of the same quality as the kensington foot rest . i now have both it and this one .it is a smaller version and does not have the same range of motion and comfortable gel foot pads .but it is far cheaper .so in balancing the function versus the price it is a very acceptable solution to leg pain when working for prolonged periods at a computer desk .i was needing another foot rest at my l shaped computer desk but did not want to pay the high price of the kensington model .when balancing the cost and usability of this foot rest i am pleased with my purchase . it provides most of the same qualities of the more expensive options . it is worth the price asked and i find it to be restful .
superyard xt is an excellent product for child containment providing exactly the protection a parent desires for outdoor play . it isn t a very large gate even when fully extended it covers an area only about the size of a medium to large playpen . but it offers enough space to keep one or two kids and their toys safely occupied .superyard xt holds up well and i have left it outside during harsh weather conditions with no problems . it is very easy to clean and to transport . the panels fold together and the carrying strap makes the job even easier still . the panels do not fold completely flat they do have some thickness so don t expect this gate to fit into a tiny space . it needs at least enough space to accommodate the thickness when all six panels are folded together .the panels on superyard xt are not very tall and because of this the gate is good only for toddlers and other kids up to about two years of age . as children get older they will be able to climb over the walls of the gate or possibly knock it down making it impractical as a containment device . but the shorter height has one clear advantage it makes it easy for parents because it can be stepped over . there is no need to dissemble the panels or open the gate to get inside .superyard xt is solid and sturdy but consumers must be careful to position it properly . the gates cannot be placed in a straight line because the design of the gate diminishes its effectiveness when used in this manner . each one of the joints has to be bent in order to become sturdy . placed in a straight line the gate cannot resist pressure and it will fall over with the slightest push .the only complaint i have with superyard xt is the small space it covers . with the limited space some people may have difficulty fitting even two kids inside the closed walls of the gate . depending on the number of toys your kids have one child might be all that will fit . this is why i strongly recommend purchasing an extension kit . this kit consists of two additional panels and while this doesn t sound like much it increases the area substantially and it makes the gate capable of handling two kids with no problems .overall superyard xt is a very good gate for child or pet containment . i brushed it off when i first saw it because it seemed like another useless product with limited use marketed solely to take our hard earned money . but now that i own the superyard i cannot imagine life without this containment device . it offers kids a place to play where they are well protected giving parents some much needed peace of mind .works great ! my child can not open it . i have of these installed . buy the extension if you have wider opening . if you have even wider opening place a piece of wood next to the wall i added an extra piece of x for one of the wide opening in the house . it gives the extra inches needed and also protects the wall .hands free operation is very handy when you have to hold the child or carry other stuff .this gate has been great for the doorway to a room that we are in and out of constantly . i initially purchased thesummer infant sure and secure extra tall walk thru gate white but i had trouble with the latch staying closed not something you want with an ambitious baby around ! sure it is more difficult to step over this gate but it will never come unlocked to allow a child to break loose . it is easy to take down anytime you need with one hand easy to carry around and the plastic does not mar the door frame or paint on the wall i lean it against for storage when not in use . the gate can be left on the door frame when the door is closed .for us the summer infant door will not close with the gate up lever handle not a knob on the door so for naptime and bedtime the gate had to be taken off . this involves unscrewing all four pressure mount posts using two hands to carry the gate one on the door part one on the frame and finding a place to put it where the metal would not damage walls or furniture . i think it would be more appropriate for a place where removal was not often necessary . and the noise ! a baby grabbing the bars and shaking can make quite a racket !
i needed a gate for the top of the stairs and searched amazon for baby gate top of stairs . this gate is the second item returned . nowhere in the description does it say that this gate should not be used at the top of the stairs . of course as soon as we opened the box the instructions clearly say do not use at the top of stairs . the gate works great in the upstairs hallway but we ll still need to buy a different gate at some point if we want the baby to have access to our room .i have a medal banister on my stairs and have been having a lot of trouble getting a gate to fit . the kidco gate in combination with the y spindle has given me a safe and secure option for the bottom of my stairs .we use this at the top of our stairs an extra tall gate is a must in this area in my opinion . we have white spindles on the stair case and this blends in nicely .
it is ok . it does protect my leather and have an organizer but i have an suv and it runs tight and small .the gate does not swing back does not close by itself and only the bottom lock worksthis car seat base does not work with graco snugride seats . just make sure you order the correct one .
you need to look at each package you buy and make sure you know where it was made . not all nylabone products are made in the us .that was before they sold out to nestle purina . we all know what happens to companies who sell out to mega corps the quality suffers they start out saying everything will remain in house under watchful eyes that never happens . already nestle purina has brought in their own management team . the ingredients will probably start becoming imported from china ! the very reason zukes came in to existence was has a quality option for pet parents who don t want to buy into the mega corp crap . zukes will never be welcome into my house again . ever . nestle purina makers of waggin train and canyon creek ranch that crap killed hundreds of dogs starting in when nestle purina bought that company . never . again .warning ! ! ! ! ! they don t even make there own food it is licensed out to another company if you look on the back of the bag it doesn t even list who it is made by it only says guaranteed by canidae and when i asked who it was made by i was either completely ignored given a huge run around only thing i ever got was a state it was made in they wouldn t even tell me the companythis is dangerous because this is how all the pet food recalls happened a few years ago by out sourcing manufacturing
like is the word and not love .for my shadow ace vt c .requires the original honda spark plug tool due to clearance issues .improve fuel economy ? nah .improved performance ? nah .if you find hard enough their website rated this plugs good to go for km .the denso are better made and packaged . have a smaller tip and a u groove electrode which can last km . but since there is no difference in using a normal and iridium plug for my bike mileage is more important .only reason to use this is if your plugs are difficult to get to or you dread spark plug changes .as everyone else points out this intake tube will make your engine sound louder during moderate to heavy acceleration but that is simply because it eliminates the factory resonance chamber . the minimum cross section is the same as your stock tube so its not capable of flowing any more air than stock . it still has the sharp degree turn to the throttle body that the oem system has . there may be some minor reduction of turbulance but at most engine speeds especially where the engine spends most of its time it won t matter . i ve never seen an independent dyno test published with a before and after with just this mod . clearly the postings on airaid s site are bs . if something this simple could increase hp and torque by across the rpm band it would be incorporated into your car from the factory . i doubt there is any hp improvement but there might be or hp gain . not enough to feel and not enough to measure with a g tech on mile runs . on my . there was zero improvement in mileage over k miles of driving compared to before . this includes some mile runs pulling a lb trailer . it does look better than the stock set up and it really makes your motor sound like it has more power . if that does it for you buy one its well made and fits great . if you want a few more hp save your money for a diablosport predator or similar . only negative with the tube is you need to loosen the clamp at the throttle body to service your stock air filter because the coupling is not as flexible as the original it doesnt need to be .measurements are repeatably consistent and seem to match other gauges i trust . however this gauge results in more missed connections that end up leaking air than other gauges .
i have this paired with the behringer c studio condenser microphone . it matches the mic well color wise and fit . the c fits the mount perfectly . i recommend this mount highly .http www .amazon .com behringer c studio condenser microphone dp b cz rlk ref sr ?ie utf qid sr keywords behringer c this is a proven classic . using it to mic my mesa boogie mark v x cabinet . sounds fantastic and is solidly built .i bought this as an interface between my mixer instruments and mics to my macbook for garageband . you have to go in and change the input and output in osx but it works great !
current version of littermaid does not work well at all . the first one i purchased lasted for five years and i was very happy with it . the pet store only had the larger version when i replaced the original . the larger version lasted for months and then died .i found the old version on amazon . it worked for six days and then died . it was replaced at no charge . the second one worked for six weeks and then died . i have been told it is not possible to get my money back because it has been more that days since the original purchase . so now i am out a wad of money and have to run the box manually .do not buy this product . this system forced me to give this product at least one star i would give it if i could .i have been buying these lamps for or years . i had an adult male iguana has sadly since passed away of old age and i have a russian tortoise and i was using these lamps for both . i would even sometimes use these bulbs when i had a sick bird that needed a bit of extra warmth . i had an additional uv source for the iguana was using this one primarily for the heat . for years these were great . they would last me a long enough time that i would forget how old they were . i would hardly ever have to buy replacements and they provided an appropriate amount of heat for the locations in which i placed them .and then about a year ago something happened . they started burning out in less than a month . several of them only lasted weeks . i even tried replacing the fixtures they were in . i used both the metal reflective types and the fixtures that are white on the inside and black on the outside . brand new or old it wasn t the fixtures the bulbs just kept going out .i was buying them at a physical store and inspecting them before use and nothing looked out of the ordinary . the boxes they came in were in good shape . so it wasn t a problem with shipping but instead with materials and or manufacturing .anyway stars because they were good at one time . perhaps they ll fix whatever is wrong in their manufacturing process and become good again . in the meantime if you are looking for a replacement item the petsmart store brand ones have lasted me for at least months so far and are still working as i type this .i bought my first box of these filters at petsmart for and here they are same exact thing from the store only half the price . i wish i found them sooner . it arrived in perfect condition as if i bought it at the store ! i could have bought boxes here for the price of the i paid dollars for . oh well lesson learned . you will definitely save money by purchasing them on here just make sure you re not completely out before you order them here . i ordered them when i was about halfway through my box and they got here right on time . will buy again . . . very soon .
i replaced all the stock mounting screws that came with our sound rack cabinet with these as they were nearly invisible with the black rails and mounting plates . the plastic washers also seem to protect the finishes better than metal washers on the equipment i mounted . inexpensive and worth it .they work nice on the guitar make sure you use glue on the on the wood screw when installing it .this will help it to stay in the wood and not back out .the rosin does the trick and it s cased in a nice wooden holder so it shouldn t crack easily unlike those round rosin containers .
don t buy this chinese piece of crap if you really need a three guitar stand . it is barely workable for two .it is easy to set up but the way the neck brackets are arranged you are only going to get two guitars comfortably on it and even then guitars can still slip off the stand even when you tighten the little rubber thingies on top to hold the neck in place . and you absolutely have to keep that tight or your guitar will at some point turn sideways and fall to the floor ground .the best thing these stands are built for are v type guitars such as my jackson rhoads as long as you can put them back to back . for les paul and strat type axes their rounded lower bout curvatures make them prone to slipping on the narrow stick like feet of the stand especially when they are new . you can t tilt the feet up to try to lend more stability to the way the guitars hang because the feet won t support enough weight to make that possible . so this thing utterly fails in its designation as a three guitar stand . if you just gotta buy something from on stage get the double hang because there is more separation between instruments and so it ends up being better balanced . but really you should just pass entirely on either the triple hang or the double hang .this is definitely a case of one gets what one pays for .this is just like any other microphone stand . it works the same and is pretty durable . the weight at the bottom will definitely stop it from falling if someone were to acciddently bump into it . . .which is great but could also be bad if you want to carry the stand around a bit . in order to do that you must either support the weight which can be a pain or unscrew it from the base . other than that it s great .i bought the stand to better organize my personal studio space and i m satisfied enough to consider purchasing a second too many instruments for my own good .still it could use some tweaks i d recommend putting lock washers under all the nuts very inexpensive and keeps the bolts tight especially on carpet where there s even more tendency for the pieces to shift about under stress . it also protects against over tightening the bolts that can bend the relatively lightweight metal arms and support bars .i can imagine people feeling queasy about storing expensive instruments on a stand that feels like it wouldn t take much to tilt over forwards but you should be able to convince yourself that the downward force of the instrument bodies especially electrics counteracts the weight of the necks leaning into the top support making a forward fall unlikely .still for sanity s sake i d position the stand close to a wall . at first this causes a dilemma because your headstocks will extend beyond the front plane of the stand . but it s easy to rig up one or two inch support pieces from wood or pipe insulation covered metal to brace the stand against the wall while providing comfortable clearance for the headstocks . removing any worry of a fall is worth the effort .the design can hold a variety of instrument body shapes the trick is to find the optimum balance point but it s not hard i fit an acoustic bass guitar a shaped ibanez artist strat sg shaped bass j bass a martin om a long neck bouzouki six string banjo and a nick lucas shaped recording king acoustic on it . that said i don t max out the seven slots i ll use at most simply because different shapes make catching a strap and banging an instrument too easy when they re that close . if i were storing all electric guitars or basses with similar shapes i might be comfortable with six or even seven .i wouldn t use this stand on stage and by on stage i mean any setting with people moving about who might come into contact with it including a house party basement jam session etc . it s simply not sturdy enough physics or no . but for my needs it works well and saves me a lot of floor space where it s tight to begin with .
this works very well for blowing out water supply lines in an rv s plumbing system . be aware that there can be water still in the lines even after blowing out air through every faucet so when winterizing it can t hurt to use a rv safe antifreeze just to keep the water at the low spots elbows valves from freezing .make sure you find a bucket where this can sit somewhat snug at the bottom .i used a standard sized bucket the kind you get at your local home improvement store . . everytime i fill the bucket with water the grid guard will invariably float up off the bottom .that said it s handy to scrub your wash mitt against to trap dirt from washing but i m not overly thrilled with this product .nice tight fit on my camper van . since i have a composting toilet and don t use the black water tank i leave this cap on all the time and use a standard hose for the gray water . highly recommended .
this is a very nicely made attractive and light weight bulletin board . we have it in our kids room for my son to hang up artwork posters and photos . the plastic frame seems durable and is a nice dark warm grey color that will look nice in any room . the cork is also thick enough to hold a standard push pin so items will stay in place !it works smoothly in the labeler and the backing is easy to remove . the drawback is that it doesn t stick very well to hard plastic surfaces or in cold temperatures . i wanted to label some oversize plastic storage bags in my garage but they fell right back off . they work best indoors on non slick surfaces .we bought this to glue fabric to wood panels and it works wonderful . holds tight dries really fast and no bubbling in the fabric .
does what it is suppose to do . what can you say about a tool . if it works properly and it does what more can you say .when you purchase this product the advertisement leads you to believe a separate power supply is required but it does come with its own power supply . there is no need to purchase a separate behringer psu sb .otherwise the time machine works fine as described .it comes with a lifetime guarantee and feels really sturdy . they come in many lengths and it is sleek and effective . great price as well .
i recently purchased this unit to replace an older v tech model . it is loaded with many useful features . overall i m happy but i ve experienced dropped calls while sitting in a chair only feet from the base . there is a short beep and the call vanishes while the handset displays out of range .pros clear sound from the handsets . above average speakerphone clarity . information such as clock cid cw and phonebook entries can be programmed into either the handsets or the base and copied to other units instead of programming each individually . easy to adjust volume control for ringer and calls . can have up to handsets only the base needs to be plugged into the phone line . extra handsets are relatively inexpensive . pairs of handsets can be used as short range walkie talkies . flexible settings for answering machine . it can be set to answer in or rings or not at all . recording time for messages can be or minutes or announce only . messages can be accessed from handsets or base . there are new message indicators flashing leds on handsets and base to alert you to the messages . number speed dial . up to phonebook entries . paging and find handset functions . deluxe call waiting . if a call comes in while you re on the phone a push of a button allows you to let the system ask your caller to hold indicate the line is busy forward the call conference answer and more . room monitering . very useful if there is a child or elderly person in another room and you need to monitor their activities . registering additional handsets to the base is very simple . charge the new handset and simply place it in the base for a few minutes . some other uniden handsets will work with this unit but only the tcx will self register .cons drops calls occasionally lower range than other cordless phones i ve had . people say my voice sometimes sounds fuzzy or stacticky . only the handsets have selection of ringtones or distinctive ring not the base . no battery backup for base unit so the entire system is unusable during a power outage .the pros definately out weigh the cons . i have mobility limitations to having handsets in every room is very useful . it is a keeper so i have decided to order additional handsets as well as a headset .the amazon .com price is higher for the system than some competitors but they have the best price for the tcx accessory handsets especially with free shipping .at t e c . ghz cordless answering system with speakerphone caller idi replaced a failing panasonic corded phone with this compact cordless model after testing several at my local electronics store . i chose the at t e c for a number of reasons style the feel of the handset solid ease of use and functionality . a belt clip and wall mount are included .what i got was a well made attractive and multi functional unit with expansion capability up to eight handsets . programming was easy the standard message simple and clear enough to use without adding a custom message even though i did add my own .there are separate phonebooks in the handset and the base each capable of storing up to entries and the handset screens incoming messages . call transfer way conference calls and last number redial are additional functions of this unit .two lithium batteries are included note directions state only lithium batteries should be used caller id and call waiting are included capabilities if you subscribe to these services .both handset and base are programmable with features such as ringer volume ringer melody remote access and caller log review .all in all this is an easy phone to set up and one that offers superior performance .recommended .i purchased this two years ago for one reason to have a phone i can use when the power goes out which happens several times a year .modern phones are terrific . . . as long as they have electric power . when the power goes out however they are helpless . i do have a deep cycle battery and power inverter for when the power goes out but having this basic phone allows me to have a phone without drawing power from my deep cycle battery . i can check with the power company talk with neighbors and potentially most important if there s an emergency i can immediately dial for help .everyone who owns a phone that plugs into an electric outlet and who lives in an area likely to experience power outages should have one of these for when the power fails . just store it in a location that s easy to access when you have no lights .
wow a bench that really holds my ass . what can i say about it you really need it with the keyboard stand . and it was necessary to the group .there s nothing wrong with this stand but for the life of me i cannot imagine how a manufacturer could manage to screw up an plain old straight mic stand .this is a great stand and highly adjustable . can be used seated or standing for a person over feet tall . there was a review i read with negative comments about the design claiming that pulling on the panel to lift the stand would cause it to come off . nonsense . there are clamps for every adjustment and the stand is rock solid . because it s lightweight and portable i could see it getting top heavy if you put a heavy book on the stand and jacked it up to maximum height . but this is a great stand .
wix filters are the best . they can be hard to find sometimes locally amazon prime is the way to go .this was bucks cheaper at amazon vs a local auto parts store . if you use it properly and service your air filter as you should you will not go wrong with this product .you cars computer ecu pcm monitors the tank for pressure if you lose tank pressure bad any autostore can scan your car for free and see p to p and others . evap failure in laymen terms the tank leaks fumes nasty smog it is you can buy a scan tool for off some bay dot com . sure can .you can look up the error codes called dtcs at any time for free there http www .myscantool .com dtc powertrain .htmlmy jeep wrangler has a bad cap and is on recall look up tsb and has a revised cap if buying one new from dealer .all caps are bad they slip and will not come off standing you .the dealer is not cheating you if you drive in and the cel check engine lamp is out he cant fix it if it is not broke . or throwing dtcs . these fact apply to all cars to present it s not something new or unique at all .the ecu can be rest scan tool after replacing the cap or you can wait for driving cycles to clear it . its your choice .there is a third way to reset but varies by car the ecu memory input power . you pull a fuse and the ecu forgets and resets to a new car settings .the cap has a vacuum breaker inside if you use a cap that has none you will collapse your tank and destroy the fuel pump rack and sometimes the pump .so getting a real oem spec . cap will save all that bad news . . . .ymmv retired mech .
i don t live very close to any pet supply stores so when i need something i usually order online or go to walmart if i am really desperate . i bought one gang valve from walmart thinking it was a pretty simple part and it wouldn t matter where i got it i was sooo wrong . the walmart one didn t work one little bit . this gang valve works perfectly . it has good seals all around adjusts easily and hangs on the back of the tank well .i bought this because it had all star rating all three . i do not know who these people were but for i got a plastic toy with no motor . this does not include a motor . its just a platic tube with a cup on top with an air tube . that s it . no instuctions either . it doesn t have anything to adjust the air or bubbles . and one of the reviewers wrote that this is better than a coralife . no way . i paid the shipping fee to return this useless and over priced toy . if you bought this and really liked it please tell me what kind of pump you attached it to and how much the pump cost .honestly i don t know how any aquarium could do without this ultra convenient and easy to use accessory in my handbook it is necessary . like many other reviewers have already stated it is a grand item that actually does what it claims to do in this day age of false advertising to supposedly numb consumers .now if it were to come in a color better suited to being displayed right there on the front window of my fish s world . . . i would buy another one . the one for acrylic aquariums is blue but mine for glass is off white . perhaps i ll dip mine in something mirror finished . and don t sell your company so someone else can make a cheaper crappier product either . well done mag floaters !
can t really tell how well it works when i lift the tube above the water level of the tank it doesn t seem to push water out of the tube when in theory it really should . strange .however stuff does get stuck to it especially at the top of the sponge so there must be suction and it should be more than enough for the bacteria to get water movement .does just what it says . i live in a wooded area and my dog does pick up ticks occasionally . i usually pull them off but if i miss one this takes care of it . they fall off well before they get fat on her blood . this will leave a greasy spot if it gets on clothing but it washes out easily .this is a no brainer . this absolutely does not impede the water flow . and if that is a concern of yours just cut the tip off of the middle or first attachment . the tube doesn t have to reach all the way down to the bottom that is what weekly water changes are for .
i had these at work these are the pens i prefer to use . i like it that is a click stick .really like these sheet protectors ! nice and sturdy . these are . mil thick . no flimsy feel . they offer super heavy duty mil protectors but these seem just right to me the non glare option is good as long as it is flush against the item inside . on a printed sheet that is a little wavy it makes parts seem slightly unfocused and bothers my eyes . think i will get the regular ones in the future since most of what i use these for is stuff i ve printed so it isn t perfectly flat .i would give stars for the clear ones .i prefer matte finished sheet protectors . i don t like the glare on the glossy ones . these seem very durable they are not lightweight at all . if you are looking for sheet protectors for a large project that would require hundreds of these i would recommend the lightweight sheet protectors . these i got to use for my recipe binders . these wipe off easily if you get food on them a plus !the box states that these sheet protectors are archival safe acid free and prints won t stick to the insides . all things which are highly desirable in serious situations . i haven t used these long enough to know if any of these statements are true but wilson jones has been around forever so i will take their word for it .
my son suggested i get the whole k n system but i opted for the factory style replacement filter instead . o .k . i am cheap . . .lol . i installed this in my f . litre fx . i keep the avg .mpg readout on in my dash . i average . and i don t drive it hard . after the filter i average . . i was shocked and i am very pleased with these results .i love this unit . now i know in detail what s wrong with my car before i take it to the shop . this lessens the opportunity that the shop will try to upsell me on a service that i may not need . i also like the idea of being able to log the issues on my computer . i have used it on a ford f nissan sentra lexus rx and a cadi devillei was looking for a general purpose multimeter for troubleshooting the starter on my geo metro i got this and i m extremely satisfied with the product i was able to check the voltage of the ignition switch and found that i had a faulty starter i was able to get thedb electrical smt starter chevy metro . l . l and it worked great . i was also able to test the voltage on a coin battery this product is great ! highly recommended !
i bought this because my band s primary pa mixer doesn t have high impedance inputs for a guitar pickup and i don t always want to bring my submixer for quick change gigs . so a small cheap di box seemed like a good solution .the pdc is a no frills device . it converts a instrument cable high z to a balanced unbalanced or xlr low z signal . it does a fine job . i don t notice it coloring the sound i .e . it s not changing the balance of frequencies transmitted although it does lower the volume somewhat . that s to be expected in a passive di box and it doesn t bother me .i m using it with an lr baggs m a active soundhole pickup . the m a spits out a fairly hot signal and i don t have any problem with the signal loss associated with the pdc . if i were using a passive pickup in my guitar the results might be different .bottom line it s small fairly light seems durable and it does a good job converting my active guitar signal to the xlr inputs our pa mixer requires . it does everything i wanted and the price was right . i see no reason to go shopping for a more expensive one .i bought this to use with my keyboard . i wasn t really aware that there were other options for keyboard pedals . it doesn t work as smoothly as the pedals do on an acoustic piano which is what i d always used . doesn t have the same feel either . nowhere close .in my opinion a sustain pedal like the m audio sp sustain pedal with piano style action or other similar pedal is a much better choice . the price difference is only a few dollars and the feel and action are so much better . the only thing i ve found the yamaha fc sustain pedal is good for is taking up space in a drawer where i keep my electric guitar pedals .i purchased this pedal recently a bit skeptical with such a low price tag however i was completely impressed with it . i don t use a tremolo effect often but when i do i just need some subtle shimmering swells . this box does the trick . construction wise it is housed in an all metal chasis . the knobs feel sturdy enough and the button seems strong by the way it is true bypass which is nice . it doesn t seem to affect my tone when i kick it on no volume or tone changes just the tremolo effect . and silly enough the yellow paint looks cool on my pedal board . i don t know if i will purchase other joyo effects but i am impressed with this one . stars .
my order came from the witz and sons fulfilled by amazon .i ve bought hp ink through amazon for years and never once had an issue . this time what i received was questionable .the product is advertised as being in retail packaging and the photo shows an hp package .however when i opened the amazon box what was inside was not in an hp retail box . instead the ink cartridge arrived unboxed . there was no hp cardboard box . it arrived in only the hp inner foil package . that means there was no hp box no upc and of course no explicit expiration date listed .the only thing on the package outside of the hp logo is a foil code . in my case the foil code is sg . i happen to be familiar with the codes on hp foil so reading the two sets of six numbers in yymmdd format i was able to see that what i was sent had an ink warranty that expired about months ago back in august and was produced in february of .while many people use ink past the warranty date that should be the choice of the consumer . here it seems likely the seller removed the box to try to pass off a old product as fresh which is deceitful at best .although the cartridges look like genuine canon they did not come in the canon packaging shown in the illustration which i find worrisome .the price i paid i paid is the price of fresh genuine virgin canon not the price of a cheap refills oem rd party cartridges counterfit cartridges or out of date repackaged cartridges .amazon promptly offered a full refund if i ship the cartridges back but that really doesn t solve the issue .i suggest contacting the seller and asking for assurance that the product is fresh virgin original canon cartridges in original canon packaging before purchasing .i am always wary of ordering ink for my printer online . according to reviews what is shown is not always what is received . these were factory sealed exactly as shown in the picture original canon . very happy .
exact replacement from oem . exact fit worked perfect . have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs .it workshighly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering suspension work . you will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover .i hate to use the pickle fork . the pickle fork is the last resort for me as it will damage the balljoint boot .i prefer to use the snap on balljoint remover . if that one cannot fit then i will try this tool . if this tool will not fit then i will resort to a pickle fork .
these oxford ruled index cards x inches are fairly thin but certainly thicker than standard paper . these are blank on one side and have the normal index card lines printed on the other .these work well for my needs and were very inexpensive .recommended !cfhthese sheet protectors are useful and of great quality . they are of . mil thick my digital caliper measured around mil and make sheets appear more sturdy to abuses . it is very easy to slide a . x sheet into them since they are non stick . i use them to protect my x photos and my kids certificates knowing that they are archival safe and acid free . they come in a protective cardboard box of .the only problem i have with them if you call that at all is that they are a rather tight fit for a . x sheet . if you try to put a slightly larger sheet or a few sheets into the same protector it might not fit . however putting a single sheet in is easy due to the non stick feature and they are sufficient tight that the sheet won t fall out .for heavy duty stapling this product isperfect with the s .f . heavy duty staples .goes through laminated card stock andpaint sticks . . .
just make sure to use a thin bath towel under the baby to keep them from sliding so much only issue i ve had is that the piece for the leg split is too wide on the baby side at four months my daughter still has a hard time having to sit there with her legs that wide apart . . . it is just short of wide on the baby side and not shaped for her legs to go over it either .this is perfect for my month baby whose inches long lbs . it s well made and not slippery at all easy to clean and the suction cup hold the tub really well . great purchase .we went straight from the swaddleme to this completely seamlessly . it is soft well made washes well cute . and the sizing is generous which is nice since it means it will last us for a while ! the medium size worked great for our month old boy who is tall inches and about lbs . it s actually a little long but that s fine b c it means he has room to move his legs around .
perfect for exhaust work . i bought it for a catalytic converter and o sensor project because it is rated for f to ffits my john deere lawn tractor which is model la and likely it fits all the l la and d series lower end john deere tractors . please post a comment if it does not and i ll update this reviewcurrently amazon says it does not fit my third generation miata nc but it doesthese filters come top in most online filter tests and i use them in almost all my carsi welded a piece of flat stock on the insert for the motorhome . this adapter is for my dodge grand caravan .
if you need a calculator that prints this is not the calculator for you . however if you need a handy sized easy to read solar calculator . . .this is a good one . it does everything that i want a calculator to do at work . it can figure . i never use these features but it can figure tax rates and has memory mrc m m . the buttons are big enough . i would buy this model again .i admit it i m an office supply junkie . you can never in my opinion have too many office supplies and that includes staplers . this swingline standard stapler value pack is absolutely one of my best purchases recently ! not only does it work well it comes with an extra box of staples and a staple remover . i m definitely set and will probably be hiding this one from my family so it s where i need it to be when i need it ! definitely a winning combination and a good value .a trimmer is essential to me because i am a mixed media artist and i also make a lot of cards . i use a trimmer daily as a matter of fact and always have one within arm s reach . i m always curious if any new technology is out that there may improve on a simple item that gets daily use and so i was thrilled to be fortunate enough to try out this new westcott titanium trimmerthis is a well made trimmer and not flimsy . the titanium metal pieces add sturdiness and as well as a nice look to the trimmer . the unit comes complete with a cutting blade as well as a scoring blade and there is a handy swing out arm for measuring and squaring up .i m very happy with this westcott trimmer . it will do a great job and i think it will prove to be durable and find long use in my studio !
replacing these helps so much with pumping . adds at least a half ounce each side when i replace these after my old ones wear down . good quality membranes .i ordered packages in order to cover the appropriate circumference of coffee table and the front edges of two end tables . when the package arrived the length of edging was not as advertised . that means i was completely short and could not complete my project . aside from the lack of length the product works well and seems secure . i would have ordered more had i known about the length . it s quite a disparity between and so purchase appropriately .i read the directions twice then installed taking less than minutes and i am pretty clueless with putting things together . one thing that should be changed is it says on the outside that a drill should be used but the directions says not to use a drill . the screws are small so a drill would be pointless . i like that it comes with paper guides so you only screww once and it is where it needs to be the first time instead of trial and error making many holes in cabinet .
just a basic female xlr to inch male adapter . i use these so i can plug my regular mic cables into my keyboard practice all in one pa .if you can drill into wood with a wood drill bit then these are for you i bought mine for an amp stack and now when i record i can simple roll the head and cabinet into the small room and record . . .you get in the package with wheels and retainers thats thick that goes into the wood of a cabinet . . . .once i read about the bugera b i knew i wanted one . why futz with tube like effects when you can have real live tubes two in fact ! only five watts yes but that s still enough to fill a room . but it s the extras that cinch the deal this is built like a brick house you can jump up and down on it if you want to . it has an internal cable for the speaker so you can easily plug in a different cabinet . comes with built in reverb . headphone jack standard . best of all an attenuator so you can get the cranked sound even at low volume levels . easily upgradeable i put new tubes and speaker into mine though i probably didn t have to . a small but effective little amp .edit i had modded my bugera with a jensen mod and used it for bass but recently i found a source for celestion super drivers and popped one of those in . amazing low end output for such a small cab !
i used to use to and decided to up it a size to the . . . i like light strings for a more classical and sweeter sound . the heavier gauges such as s are okay too but the s seemed to be used a lot for the chop rhythm which i don t ascribe to . at one point i did have a set of bluegrass s on it but they didn t feel right for me plus i didn t like the way the s sat on top the nut i was a bit worried that the nut would crack which is what happens when the gauges are too fat for the nut slot .if you want s i would highly recommend you take it to a tech so he can evaluate the nut and slot it to the proper width to accommodate the .the reason i switched from to is that i was hard pressed and in need of a set and the local music shop didn t carry the s any longer so i went to the . i believe my mando was set up with s or s but i wasn t sure . i tweaked the action and the s are fine and i ve made the adjustment .strings ahem . . . . are just about all the same . they local music shop is very knowledgeable and they told me a story around namm shows and how the string booths don t really give out too much info and the origins of their products . there may be according to the my local music shop a few companies that actually make their own strings but the bulk of the strings out there are probably manufactured in a mass quantities at factories in prc or other offshore sources sold in bulk and packaged by the companies . who knows ? and the shop sure tried to find out but it s a dark dark secret out there at the trade shows so nobody is talking and making a logical assumptions from a corporate standpoint are probably not too far off the mark i .e . strings are mass produced for market and most string companies as i said earlier are buying bulk and packaging for the consumers .what does that mean ? that means i need some inside info to this bulk purchasing and i ll sell my own ! the quality is probably up as much as the tooling and raw materials will allow so why not !cheers !i already use the exl as my go to electric string and tried these as part of the vine program . i have to say i really couldn t feel the difference . from what i can see the only real difference in this balanced set is that the d string gauge is . whereas the same string in the exl set is . . since the string construction and plating is the same i have to assume these will have the same longevity . i guess as long as both are still available exl being phased out ? i will be selecting solely on price . either way you can t go wrong as d addario makes a fine product at a reasonable price .if you own an american strat or tele this is a must have for the neck of your prize . i love this . it proudly states the guitar s origin of corona . california with the classic fender name scribed . wonderful . i have these on all three of my fenders . again these should really come standard on all american strats .
fits great and helps to eliminate feedback . i could see some having problems with the size of their sound holes and it can be a tight fit but it definitely works .just got this in this week . looks nice and works as intended . for bucks can t really go wrong . i use this with a behringer c and have had no trouble getting it to fit . it s a bit snug but i would prefer a snug fit over a loose fit .they are and look the right size and fit the cover well a must when you want the right screw for the job thanks
i bought it for my turtle and fish and it just does not filter anything and i tested it to see if maybe i was wrong and i was not . i think i might have to rethink even having pets at all since i can not get the right equipment for themi love that i can get a two pack of these bulbs for the price of just one at the petstore . i always like to have a backup just incase .i love that i can get on here order my parts and fix my own things love this i recomend
we have another plastic swinging door for our indoor outdoor cat but this one is for a sliding screen door on one of our decks . it s the right size for our cat was installed in just a few minutes and works perfectly . the little movable locks on the bottom sides didn t stay in place but wouldn t have stopped our cat if she wanted to get in or out . we taped over them because they would slide to easily all by themselves . we close the glass door to keep her in or out when necessary .we were looking at the glass door inserts but not only do they not allow your sliding door to lock but they are hundreds of dollars . since our only goal was a way to let our cats in and keep the flies out during the day we were leaving our screen door open for them this seemed like a perfect alternative .it was easy to install i do suggest leaving a little more screen then they suggest when you are doing the cutout and works great for letting them in and out .a couple of items about it to help you make your decision if you live where there are alot of mosquitoes or gnats they will be able to fit btwn the cracks in the unit . you will have to close the glass door to keep them out . works great for areas like ours in ca where we just have to worry about flys and wasps .i recommend installing it in the middle of the door . when i lock the cat door they paw at it if they want to go out and it can get rough on the screen . we installed it in the middle of the door and so we can just close the glass door halfway to keep them from pawing at it .i was worried my dogs would get confused as to which doggie door to use . i have a patio door doggie door and when i closed my screen door my dogs could not get in or out . now with this in my screen door i can close the screen and my dogs can still get in or out . great idea and works well with the patio doggie doors . they are so smart they know which to use and when .
the behringer usb premium input mixer is just what the doctor ordered . nice unit and works perfectly for vocals guitar bass guitar and keyboards . don t lock yourself down with a bad usb cablebefore i purchased the fbv i scoured the web to see how it works with the pod hd desktop and even the advanced users guide leaves you thinking . .anyway i lucked out and found a used one going cheap and after some time figured out exactly what you can and cannot do with the pod hd desktop fbv express ii combo . . first in the setup screen do not enable the fbv express . yes i know this sounds dumb but internet scouring shows there is a bug that this is a workaround for . . . . read the fbv express users guide and calibrate the pedal . . there is no need to d l the fbv software for this .now . . in the pod setup screens you have the option to either have the abcd buttons as abcd or to be fs fs . this behavior is mimicked by the switches on the fbv .so . . in abcd mode you can a select preset a b c or d from the group you are currently in .b insert a volume fx and use volume pedal . . .exp c insert another fx enabled by toe switch and controlled by pedal as exp d tap temp by tapping the currently selected preset . .ie the pedal that is lit e enable the tuner press hold the current selected preset pedal f you have some basic control of the looper but cannot enable it . edit looper control is flawed . you can record and go to overdub but you cannot record then play stop the loop . . you can stop from overdub but not start the loop . seemingly an acknowledged and unfixed bugnice enough but if you are like me switching presets is way way less useful than switching fx blocks on off . incidentally you can combine blocks such that one pedal say turns od on and delay chorus both off or turn one amp on and one off channel switching . . yay ! ! you cry that sounds like me so its a no to abcd and mode fs fs it is for me ! . .so yup in fs mode you can do that you cana enable disable sets of block s using the four pedalsb use volume and expression options as above ie like volume or wah overdrive level delay fb etc c basic control of looper but cannot enable itedit looper control flawed as stated abovec enable the tuner ? . . .oh sod it . nope you can td tap tempo ? . . nope not that either .so in summary the express is better than nothing but certainly does not provide hands free operation of the desktop . . the shortboard is worth the extra or if you are reading this before buying the pod . . get the hd x instead .do not expect this to sound like a fender frontman with x speakers . but for practicing in your bedroom or similar it s perfect . plenty of sound effects to mess around with . are they as good as dedicated per stomp box effects ? probably not but so what . just found out the best part of this amp . you can connect it via the usb port to your pc not only for using the rather cheesy fender software but it lets you pipe your guitar s sounds into software like garage band . you can thus save yourself a dedicated audio interface like an m audio m track or similar . ps it is not recommended to go directly from the guitar to the mic or line in in of your computer even with the right adapter plugs as the impedances will not be right . on top of that i have connected the mac s headphone audio out to the amp s aux in ! sounds much better than listening to the pc s normal puny speakers .update while the built in usb interface does work a dedicated device with good pre amps like the focusrite i is much better in getting guitar audio into a computer .update to the update while i am keeping this amp for convenience i have quickly learned that nothing can match a real tube amp . you can simulate all you want and i am talking much more expensive sw solutions its like imitation chocolate vs . real chocolate . got the marshall dsl watt combo . amazing sound .
item was exactly as promised . shipping was speedy and item came packaged for safety . great seller . i will shop again with this seller !should have went with the xl would have been nice if dimensions were given in product discription but i can live with it . .when purchasing this kitty kap patented you are receiving one cap . others have mentioned it and i will post pictures .this is a good cap for the larger . ounce cans and i have not tried it for the smaller cans but it should work . i paid nearly . for the top but i thought i was getting two of them . i hope the seller will make it clearer that the buyer is receiving only one .the plastic is thick and durable and the design with the ridges to fit every can seem to be reasonable . i did want to make note that there was a sticker inside the lid that states intended for pets only keep out of the reach of children ? ? ? ? what about covering a can of human food . . . is that a problem ?why ? does it have something to do with lead content in the plastic ? if so please state this . why the warning or clarification sticker make this clear in the description .the product seems nice but i am giving it three stars for the amazon presentation the outlandish price and the warning sticker .keeping them honest .
our travel trailer w three slideouts has the factory electric stabilizer jacks at the front and back which are great at stabilizing the ends . but in between these over the axles we can feel the trailer flex and slightly bounce especially when we are entertaining have folks congregate in the middle . these work really well when placed just in front of the tires . we simply crank them up snug against the frame rail on each side . now the trailer doesn t bounce or wiggle nearly at all . too bad rv manufacturers on long wheel base units don t add in a third stabilizer in the mid section to keep up down flex movement of leaf springs tires from causing bounce feeling . we also have the bal x jacks between the tires to prevent any roll effect from front to back .these are solid jacks for trailers that sit high . i use two of these jacks on a small off road box trailer that s pulled by a jeep so it sits high . the trailer has a rough top tent mounted on top of it and with these the trailer is stable with jacks underneath . they re easy to adjust and level the trailer out .i did however find one of the chains was broken for a pin . it s a minor issue but i can t give it a perfect rating for that reason .i have a jeep xj cherokee with about of lift and tires . i have a hi lift jack . i got the smaller one mainly b c of space as i wanted it to fit under my rear seat in my jeep . with the i can use my front bumper or my rocker rails as jack points however it would be pretty difficult to get a tire off the ground unless i maxed out the jack . this item helps a lot to raise the wheel off the ground and be able to put something underneath the wheel for better traction like a log or rock . my only small complaint is that there is a nut that holds this onto your hi lift . would be better if the nut was a bit longer and that it came with a wing nut instead of a lock nut . otherwise the build quality is very good it has a rubber pad that goes up against the tire . the hooks are extremely strong and the straps are stitched very very well .
i like this crock bowl a lot . when our dog puts his paw on the edge of the bowl the bowl stays put . it s a nice size for a water bowl or a feeding dish . it s easy to clean and looks good . what more can you ask of a dog bowl ?i use this for my cat love it . since the bowls are removable i can change out just the water when starts getting gross or i can scoop fresh food into the other bowl when ever i need to . the removable bowls are very handy because you don t have to pour out your food in order to replace the water . most bowls like these are permanently connected so if you kick the bowl or bump it by accident you end up splashing water into the food bowl making it soggy then you have to change both bowls out to get everything fresh again . i like this set because i can change the the water out many times without even touching the food side i do not have to own separate bowls that can get scattered on the floor .love the fact you can take the water bowl or the food bowl out . i ve realized after purchasing countless .other bowls that this is the best method as the water bowl can get grungy after a little while and plus my dog tends to get treats and other particles in her water bowl dish . just wished it was a little higher in height
this was the third monitor that i tried and i think this one is great . the only concerns that i have are that the lights don t really correspond with the noise . if a car goes by the noise isn t really that loud but the lights go all the way up . if the base is too close to the receivers you ll get noises but that s the only problem i ve had . sometimes switching channels on it will cause me to hear my neighbor s telephone conversation but i switched it back and it was fine .i love that it has receivers . i have one in my bedroom and another in my den on the other side of the house so i can always hear the baby and i don t have to move them around . i also like the fact that i can hear my son breathing . . .that s how sensitive the monitor is . i love it .we have a two story house and i thought it would be good to have the dual monitors so i could have one in the master bedroom and one downstairs in the living room . about it works beautifully . it picks up everything and if i need to hear if i m on the right channel i can clap my hands loudly downstairs and it ll light up downstairs indicating that i am on the right channel . however the remaining of the time it makes obnoxious static sounds . i hate it . we simply run our filtered water at the sink and it kicks it into static mode at which point all the cussing and shaking of the device won t get it back to normal . i don t feel like i can rely on it because i never know when it s going to act up or what exactly it is that triggers the static sounds .so it has served its purpose i d rather have it than nothing at all but i d recommend it if you live off the grid and have a no fly zone over your house because when it starts crackling it doesn t seem to stop and as ridiculous as it may sound we swear small planes flying over with their radios on send the thing buzzing .my last fisher price did a little buzzing thing too but it was more manageable . i end up turning this current one down so low to tolerate sleeping with the loud fuzz sound coming from it then i can t hear my baby . and if the volume is down i can look at the light display to see if a noise i hear is my daughter or soemthing else but when it s having a static attack it lights up . i ll be glad to be done with these things altogether .i d be curious to know which ones out there are the most effective .good luck .this monitor is awful . do not waste your money . it certainly isn t crystal clear . i can t hear my son in the next room . often times i will wake up to another family waking up . how awkward .
this is a great comb for getting the mats out of long haired dogs . it also works well on my long haired outdoor cat . would recommend .the best dog . . . . . . . . . . .comb ! safari grooming inch long comb for dogs stainless steel . . . . . . . . . . .my doggy groomer recommended these and they are great . . . . .it works ok for my poodle cat and long haired dog . it is not easy to clean if my long hair dog has rolled in the dirt .
use these bags daily they are very sturdy and have not had any rips yet .using them as mailers for soft items .the adhesive is very strong hard to get the bag open once it is sealed without scissors . nice because they are waterproof . flexible so they can ship a lot of different items .these are quite thin which is nice for conserving storage space . they are thick enough to protect normal paper contents . and the adhesive works great . in fact i have never had a problem with these coming unsealed .
we brought it for the space between kitchen and dinning room . we didn t want to drill any holes therefore we choose this . it clearly said can be hardware or pressure mounted . yes they are correct if you are not planning on using the door function to this gate . if you plan on opening the door part it will release pressure of the side of the gate . therefore you need to remount the gate . i m not feet but only a petite person and it will be hard if i just climb across .bottom line it s misleading when they said it can be pressure mounted ! please note if you are using the door it will release the pressure mount side .this is an excellent gate . we needed a gate that did not rely strictly on tension mounts . the hardware mounting option is easy but the instructions are a little difficult to follow .it boils down to this you need to extend the gate to the correct length by popping the tabs the lock its position into place . these are painful to unpop but after one or two tries you ll get the hang of it . after that use the included paper template for where you need to drill holes . drill the holes inches deep you must go two inches or screwing in the screws will be hard to do even if you use your drill to screw them in . pop the gate onto the hinges that you mount after drilling drill screw in the mounts on the opposing side and you are done . its really much less complicated than the multi lingual directions lead you to believe .this has become our new favorite gate . once you get over the fear or dislike of drilling into your banisters handrails it really does become the most functional easy to secure gate you can buy in my opinion .we tried the metal tension mounted gates and they always seem to lose their grip and need to be re adjusted all the time . they also place alot of stress on your railings and if your railings flex at all maintaining the tension mount will be difficult . that is the major reason we chose this gate . additionally this gate swings open giving you of the width of your walkway to walk through whereas most tension mount gates have a smaller opening to walk through after you mount the gate .this is the best gate we have used !i was really excited about this gate until we tried installing it . my husband and i are both pretty handy so we thought it wouldn t be a problem .the template for mounting was a nice addition especially if you ve tried mounting a regalo gate to the wall those things are impossible to align perfectly and quickly .here s what you need to know before purchasing if you intend to mount at the top of stairs the opening must be between . and . wide the hardware must be screwed into wood or studs not drywall or anything else . you may need a stud finder to locate the studs . the hardware has to be at least inches from the stairs . make sure your walls extend a ways beyond the steps . you need a drill with a bit you need a phillips screwdriver this won t work with short baseboards or curved baseboards that are shorter than inches if you have baseboards that aren t completely flat e .g . if you have trim at the bottom then you will have to do some creative problem solving either filling up gaps with wood or removing trim .if you have tall flat baseboards then you can use the handy dandy extenders they include for you on the top of the hinge .i d give this stars for pressure mounting for top of stairs use but about for the unexpected complications . i reviewed the information before purchasing but i wish i had known above before making my purchase .
good adapter no problem with it yet does the job when i need it . i do recommend . doesnt worth it to pay more .tksthey say if you buy the best you won t be sorry . but just because it costs more doesn t mean it s the best does it ? well i think in this particular case it is the best . and you will pay for it .the chevron techron product gets high scores from everyone everything i have read in many automotive mags but the equipment they make it with must be made from gold boullion . suffice it to say if you want to clean your engine parts that gas touches this stuff is the best . i just gave it stars because of price not quality . i own several cars motorcycle boat waverunners so i d buy it by the case if the price would come down enough to make it worth while . on the other hand if you have one or two cars i guess you don t need to put it in the tank all that frequently to obtain the results you want . a bottle of piece of mind ? yes it works .this item does what it s supposed to do protect the tow ball . i m very satisfied with my purchase . the price was reasonable and it works . what more can you ask for ?
i really like this pen . it has a soft cushion and the ink glides smoothly . it also has an ink indicator to let you know how much ink is left since the pen is transparent .these sarasa gel pens are great to write with . the ink flows evenly and smoothly . however as with all gel pens the ink does not last as long as it does with an old fashioned ball point pen . if you use these pen for art work as i do you need to know that the ink in the light blue pen is almost as dark as the ink in the navy pen . also the burgundy ink is more of a dark brown than a dark red although that is true for other brands as well . over all these are some of the best gel pens available although pricy .for the price this is the best pen on the market and it is retractable . the pen is comfortable in your hand and is writes so smoothly and it comes in several ink colors . i ordered more of them in the blue ink !
i love the whole avent system ! these are great sippy cups in large part because all avent pieces are modular and fit each other . so if you have been using avent bottles you can put the sippy cup tops and handles on the bottles .you can pop out the magic valve that makes this a sippy cup and fit in the nipple from the bottle . or you can take the collars from your bottles and fit the magic valve in it . it is wonderful ! especially since you have so many ways to fit the sippy cup together if you have already been using avent bottles .i reviewed the playtex first sipster sippy cup around years ago when they were the old style one piece lid and spout . our older child learned how to use a cup with the first sipster and we really liked them . we like to have our kids transitioned to sippy cups by months of age so i recently picked up the new style of cup and tried it with our month old . playtex now markets this as the training time cup and while it s adequate for the task i prefer the old style of cup as of february playtex still shows the old style cup on their website but the training time cup has replaced it on store shelves .the new style cup still has the twist click lid but the actual click mechanism feels tighter and a little harder to actually open and close . the biggest difference is that the spout which used to be integrated into the lid with a leak resistant valve on the inside that snapped into place is now a soft clear spout valve combo .the handle is not integrated into the cup lid meaning more individual pieces to wash . with the old cup you had three the cup the lid spout handles and the plastic valve . now there are four cup ring with handles which admittedly are optional lid and integrated spout valve . with the old style you could also buy new valves only and i have not found replacement spout valve pieces for the new style cup available in any store .i think that the biggest flaw is that the new design is less resistant to biting by a child who has teeth . the old spout was made of a softer plastic overmolded on a hard plastic protrusion on the lid so there was no way a baby toddler could ever do major and potentially hazardous damage to the spout by biting on it . the new spout is made of a thin clear silicone similar to the old style avent soft spout . while our month old is still toothless i worry that once she has teeth she will actually be able to bite through the new spout . it is also not leak proof which we discovered after around oz of water ran out of the cup and all over the baby and our hardwood floor . with the integrated spout valve if the baby just gums the spout sideways it allows the water to run right out obviously this could not happen with the old style where the valve was inside the cup lid .on the plus side the handles are removable there are and handled rings and there is a straw cup option that you can also buy . all lids handles cups in this playtex cup series are interchangeable .bottom line while the new cup gets the job done i will be interested to see how the new design holds up over several months of use . the old design was pretty much bulletproof and the perfect sippy this one has a couple of issues that were made apparent in the first couple of days of use . i am a mechanical engineer in r d albeit in a completely different industry and playtex has really gone backwards with the design changes to their sippy cups .as an aside to a common complaint in other reviews when it says assorted colors it means that you get the next box on the warehouse shelf . if you re not cool with a boy using a pink or purple sippy cup then it s probably best to opt for a purchasing method where you can select the specific color s that you want .these bottles are the best for switching between bottle and breast . my daughter hardly ever has to take a bottle but when she does she has no problem with these . she would try to inhale smaller nipples because they didn t have the broad base like the breast does and like these playtex nipples do . plus playtex now has a storage system for pumping into the liners . this set comes with an adapter to connect to the pump and some caps . you can also buy more caps . they make it so easy to store milk and then just pop it on the bottle . the adapter definitely works with the medela pumps . i think it will work with all except maybe avent .
this is accurate and can be used for many different purposes it is durable and can be used while playing .this pedal has a great range of function with variable width and depth along with an independent level control and tone controls for low and high frequency cutoffs . it also has a dry through output .it can go from low depth high speed shimmers to high depth low speed oscillations to ridiculous warble .the pedal is light weight very high quality durable quite good looking and all around a good pedal to play around with .cons the blue led like many blue leds is very bright i usually cover them up with a sticker so i can see the setting on the pedal .it can also be easy to accidentally touch the pedal casing with the positive barrel of when plugging in this can frighteningly spark . so make sure to plug in the power adapted into the pedal before plugging in the wall .this is a great low cost stand that accepts both acoustic and electric guitars . the cradle and neck height are both adjustable enabling a variety of guitar sizes to be used . while it doesn t fold up small like a portable stand it serves well as a semi portable stand and is very good as a stationary stand .
we purchased this gate for the top of the stairs . we live in a townhouse and have an unusal stairwell i suppose . installing this gate was a great pain ! we could not find a stud in the wall to match up with the areas we would need to install it at and had to purchase toggle bolts to better secure the gate into the wall . . . .so a toddler putting lots of force on it would not rip the gate and the drywall out thus tumbling down the stairs . also we have molding and while the gate does come with extenders to work around over the molding it didnt work for us . we had to install the gate above the molding thus leaving a to inch gap from the floor to the gate . this is bad ! our daughter has tried to squeeze her way under the gate to get down the stiars and almost managed to do this feet first . luckily i am never out of view of her upstairs nor not upstairs with her small townhouse ! and only purchased it for the safety of knowing she wont lose her balance at the top of the stairs . i have only used this gate for a top of stair gate so i have nothing else to compare it to . hopefully it is only that i live in an oddly shaped home and it works great for most other folks .note it does take a lot of measuring up and making sure that every point matches up perfectly or the gate will not operate properly or smoothly . i do however like the top lift bar to open the gate and it is easy to unlock and lock back into place with two button ontop the lift bar handle . while i still had problems using it as a top of stair gate i do think it would work very well as a doorway gate .this is an excellent gate . we needed a gate that did not rely strictly on tension mounts . the hardware mounting option is easy but the instructions are a little difficult to follow .it boils down to this you need to extend the gate to the correct length by popping the tabs the lock its position into place . these are painful to unpop but after one or two tries you ll get the hang of it . after that use the included paper template for where you need to drill holes . drill the holes inches deep you must go two inches or screwing in the screws will be hard to do even if you use your drill to screw them in . pop the gate onto the hinges that you mount after drilling drill screw in the mounts on the opposing side and you are done . its really much less complicated than the multi lingual directions lead you to believe .this has become our new favorite gate . once you get over the fear or dislike of drilling into your banisters handrails it really does become the most functional easy to secure gate you can buy in my opinion .we tried the metal tension mounted gates and they always seem to lose their grip and need to be re adjusted all the time . they also place alot of stress on your railings and if your railings flex at all maintaining the tension mount will be difficult . that is the major reason we chose this gate . additionally this gate swings open giving you of the width of your walkway to walk through whereas most tension mount gates have a smaller opening to walk through after you mount the gate .this is the best gate we have used !this kidco configure gate is worth every penny if you need to enclose and odd shaped space ! we needed to block off a hallway in our basement but had uneven walls and this gate works perfectly . the installation was a little bit involved since you have to screw the brackets into studs in the walls but it only took about minutes and we had it up .some tips for installing the gate . first read through the entire instruction manual before you start . the way the manual is structured there are instructions in several languages in the front and then reference pictures in the back . if you read through the manual and flip back and forth until you understand the pictures before you start it makes the installation go pretty smoothly . . try to mount the brackets to studs in your walls . since you can configure the gate to any length angle by changing the angle of each joint try to configure it so that you can mount each bracket to a stud in the wall so you don t have to worry about energetic kids pulling them out . . try to configure the gate so that each joint is at least at a degree angle . if you put them straight across the gate will flex a little bit . it doesn t really affect the stability of the gate since it is anchored to the walls but the flexing will go away if you angle each sectionoverall this gate worked for enclosing our odd shaped space perfectly and i would highly recommend it !
the gm bumper connector has its own cap to keep the weather out and so does this adapter . but i really wouldn t leave this adapter plugged in all the time because the gm connector then is not sealed .this adapter fits well with a locating keyway that fits the groove of the gm connector aligning all the pins correctly . it s a tight fit so that it won t fall out in case the cable to your trailer has enough weight to tug on this adapter to any significant degree .i don t have any illumination problems so the led functions are not fully tested . frankly i do a walk around after hooking up anyway with marker lights and flashers on to check that everything works . i presume the leds will tell me if there s an issue some day .bought them with the cruiser plates and while they did fit the plates they did not fit the wholes on the car . dont know why . work fine on the front but not the rear . also they are security screws so do not lose the device that comes with them . fyii purchased this to be able to attach a high end hydraulic assisted bike rake on the back of my jeeps jks with the rear tire still on . it fit perfectly and teamed with the bolt lock blt receiver lock keyed specifically for your line of vehicle it can be kept in the jeep and my daughter doesn t need anything but her car key .the extender is exactly as advertised well made fit perfectly and does eactly what it is inteded for .
highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering suspension work . you will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover .i hate to use the pickle fork . the pickle fork is the last resort for me as it will damage the balljoint boot .i prefer to use the snap on balljoint remover . if that one cannot fit then i will try this tool . if this tool will not fit then i will resort to a pickle fork .fits great and i love that i don t have to have the key in it to make it lock . i have to do that with the master coupler and hitch lock that i use when transporting .the great thing about a hi lift jack is that it will last longer than you . however at some point you re going to need to replace the climbing pins . if i were buying these separately at the hardware store i be out tops . oh well they work and that s what counts !
almost nothing to it mass wise has an adhesive disc on the back approximately . across slightly off center . the actual mirror part thought seems to be silvered plastic no surprise but arrived with what appears to be scuffing directly from the packaging itself . as long as there isn t a light source in the reflection it s barely noticeable but it s there .first things first . . .any protection this offers is purely incidental . you are fastening a metal grid to a plastic lens . duh . but from a style standpoint it does dress up the tail light assembly . one bar does pass right in front of theback up light which does diminsh its function . installation is very simple . directions are clear . the item is a bit pricey but the quality is good and the paint job good . it is a simple way to dress up your ride .the tender jr . does not come with a cigarette adapter so i cut this in half to make two . i purchased lighter plugs for a buck each from china with free shipping and they are working fine . these aren t an exact match with the tender cables but they fit together ok and are easy to determine polarity with the wire colors . you can also just use this as an extension cord for your tender . the description states a length of inches but it s actually inches tip to tip on the connectors . nice item for the price and it s made in mexico .
i like it it is inexpensive do a good job and check your connections on the same time . great item .this product is very good but not great . it s their consumer grade polishing glaze and their professional line is really great ! a good product at a very reasonable price .good product ! !

if the thought crosses your mind that you need a foot rest then i would certainly recommend this model . its a pretty wide inches base that gives your feet plenty of room to rest and move around or have your feet apart comfortably . its fairly heavy so you know the steel can handle some weight . there is no assembly you just pull it out of the box and place it on the floor . if you have sleek floors it has rubber feet in the corners to prevent it from sliding around . the top area is covered with a comfortable yet slightly gritty pattern that is good for shoes or bare feet .once on the floor it is easily adjustable with your feet just by pushing up or down . once there it stays snug without feeling loose . you can adjust the tightness of the foot rest with the two nuts on the inside .while simple in design its perfectly functional and a solid piece of furniture that will outlast most furniture .the cart is well made craftsmanship assembly etc . no complaints .my only gripe is that the shelves are to me up side down . i dont want the lip on the shelf pointing upwards . most of my wire shelves have the lip pointing down at the front tip of the shelf . this makes it more convenient to pull out larger jugs off the shelf . i suppose some can argue that the jugs could slip off while one moves the cart so it is better to have the lip pointing up . of the time the cart is stationary for me . only a few times a year i would move it out of the utility room to make more room for carrying bulky things through the utility room . that said i would rather have at least the top and center shelves to have the lip pointing down .my review title says it all . this footrest offers all i could ask for .designthis footrest is wide and sturdy which is nice if you adjust your feet position a lot during the day . it has a nonslip surface on top for your feet and four nonslip pads on the bottom so it doesn t slide around on your floor which is low pile carpet in my office s case . you can adjust the height up an inch by loosing some wingnuts sliding the top up into a higher notched position in the track and tightening the wingnuts again . you can also tighten the other nuts to make it harder to tilt . it is fine by default but i checked ! materialsthe construction is all metal with recognizable hardware holding it together . it is lightweight but strong and does not look cheap though who s looking at your footrest anyway ! . overall i would recommend this footrest enthusiastically especially over a plastic footrest at or near the same price point .
this was very easy to put together ! top just slips on the folding bottom part of stand and is very adjustable . love it !like many here the case could be an inch bigger . for my ibanez i cut the bottom material along the edge against the side wall enough to take out the bottom foam and then put the material back . now mine closes without pressure on the bridge .these have a lower profile and can fit and bend into the places the ones with thick metal ends can t .
love the rubber band ball . i have one ball at home . one ball at school . my students and my kids like to play with the rubber band ball . i find the ball all over the house and not in my office where it belongsmy husband and i are in a band and we changed up our music books to be songs from singers . makes it so much easier to go to willie nelson when they ask for a willie song . great idea this was actually a gift to my attended meetings . we really needed this to present and or discuss teach information to the group
this product does what it is designed to do very very well . it is not used very often but when it is it works beautifully .this is a lemon oil used for cleaning and conditioning the rosewood fingerboards of guitars . this only gets done once a year on the average guitar so if you re like me this one bottle will supply you for many lifetimes . other than that it is what it is and does what it says . the applicator contains a dispensing valve so push down hard to open it when you want the oil to flow .the label says not to use this product on maple fingerboards . doesn t say why but my guess is it will discolor them so be forewarned .everything from the string cleaner to the polish works very well .you have to be very careful with the fretboard cleaner because it will dry out the fretboard but the conditioner is included and can be applied after .the string cleaner does not really leave much residue and really does help with string noise .you wont be let down .dunlop makes good quality products .
i bought this warmer before i gave birth and knew that i would need it especially at night . it is very effective and is easy to use . i would advise ppl not to fill the water vile unless you are warming up maybe oz of thickened milk . i will make it hot . based on frequency of usage you will learn how much water to use . i mainly do the water vile half way unless the milk was previously refrigerated and cold . it is better to use this product than a microwave with your baby s breast milk .great product . i use it at nights . it is a lifesaver when my son wakes up and needs his expressed milk instantly . having the chiller compartment saves me the trip to the refrigerator . sometimes i forget the ice pack and will use a ziploc bag with crushed ice as an alternate . as soon as i pop it in the chamber by the time i am done changing him it is ready to go . i agree the measuring water is confusing so i just check it periodically to ensure the bottle doesn t overheat . one thing to note is that it heats up glass bottles super fast vs . the plastic bottles . so if you need speedy turnaround use the evenflo glass bottles they heat up in under minutes !these storage bottles are great because you can use them to store breast milk or formula . i like making a few bottles at night then later at night as i need them i warm a bottle take storage top off and add a nipple and i am ready to feed my daughter . i love all the avent products because of how easy everything is to use .
i bought this product for only one reason i have several amps that are not guitar amps but stereo or pa type clean high powered two channels that i want to use as guitar amps either as the primary or backup . this tube modeler acts first as a pre amp and then adds gain volume control crunch whatever to the non guitar amps to make them sound like guitar amps . i don t really care what tube amps it models or what mic placement i just want the guitar amp sound and style . i also use it in front of a behringer ultra g di box so that the di box splits the signal coming from the tm and sends half to my non guitar amps and guitar speakers on stage and the other half to the house pa . i don t think that many people would do this .the sound you get out of this box is affected by what amp and kind of amp you are driving with it and also what kind of speakers that amp is driving . the acoustics of the space you are playing in also affects the sound but i ve used this box with all of its settings driving pa amps home stereo amps bass amps and guitar amps all of which drove pa speakers bass speakers and eminence commonwealth guitar speakers all in the same acoustic space . each combination of amp and speaker with all settings on the box held constant sound different some more like guitar amps and speakers some not . as i said i don t really care about what tube amp is being modeled only that i get an authentic guitar and speaker sound out of the box . it works for me .i read reviews that say that this is a digital knockoff of the analog sansamp gt and based on its performance so far it has served as kind of like a cheap preview of what the sansamp can do . i would consider getting the gt in the future but for now this product is for me the poor man s tube amp .i ve been using and abusing pedal effects since the s . . . . running all sorts of things through them chaining them in all sorts of configurations and have endured many wall wart pedal meltdowns over the years . i said all that b c i don t want to come off as condescending . i ve learned that the single most effective way to power pedals properly is to have an infinite number of v batteries or to be very careful to match pedal inputs with correct adaptor outputs . check the polarity of the tip is the tip positive or negative ? you ll fry a boss pedal in a flash if you plug a hot positive tip into one . make sure the polarity matches most pedals want negative tip adaptors except digitech which want plugs . make sure the voltage matches . a v adaptor into a v pedal won t power it . checking that these things are right will save you some and some of the behringer pedals i use about six of them on my board . . .see product links are polarity fragile and will break right away with the wrong adaptor . i fried a bbe delay the same way . happy effecting ! !behringer sm slow motion effects pedalbehringer dd guitar delay effect pedalbehringer cs compressor sustainer ultimate dynamics effects pedalbehringer adi v tone acousticbehringer pb preamplifier volume boosterbehringer ph classic phase shifterbehringer us ultra shifter harmonist ultimate pitch shifter harmonist effects pedalbbe two timer dual modedigitech dgr grunge analog distortion pedalelectro harmonix micro q tron envelope follower pedaljim dunlop m mxr m distortion digitech rp guitar multi effects processorthe behringer usb premium input mixer is just what the doctor ordered . nice unit and works perfectly for vocals guitar bass guitar and keyboards . don t lock yourself down with a bad usb cable
works just like it needs to . perfect fit for the tailgate on my chevy when the oem clip busted .great fitit a belt . . . it fits it hold and it rotates . there is no noise coming from it .happy with the fit and performance .
does what its meant to do and achieve when administered correctly . use only when necessary . great to have in emergencies .does not remove or transform nitrates and nitrites . good for preventative use and general upkeep of your glorious tank . yeah .only complaint is that if you want to add extra activated carbon you will need to slit the top of the filter and manually add some in . you don t need to replace the fiber as much as it says on the box that way just replace the old carbon with new carbon .
germany company manufacturing is in china . . . i have always found this to make the product hit or miss but the last two behringer products that are in my hands are very good .these strings are just prefect and feel awesome . as you can tell from the amount of reviews on this product they are extremely popular . . and all those people cannot be wrongthis thing rocks ! unlike other cheap chinese made ripoffs ahem . . . behringer these joyo products are well made inexpensive and worth every penny .
i am completely blown away with these headphones . the second i got them in the mail i plugged it up to my mac pro opened up itunes and played a song . simply put it was amazing i was able to hear every single track individually ! i later plugged the ath m s into a korg triton studio recorded a session with some great microphones and edited a project in final cut all with the same results . the sound is so clear with these headphones you will notice every flaw no matter how small in whatever you are working on which is a great thing . i have worked with a lot of headphones including some that cost many times what these do and i keep coming back . i have seen a few people comment that the bass is not punchy enough this is simply not true the bass is amazing any stronger and these headphones would not be true to the source . make no mistake the ath m s are extremely accurate and sound fantastic .before we get started i am more pro than amateur . i work at a church as a pastor of worship arts and use this in my work . but i hesitate to say i m only pro because amateur means you do something purely for the love of it . . . and i feel that way about music . . . so . . .first . . . the models i ve tested are far and away more realistic to my ears than other modelers i ve used which includes logic studio s amps these sound almost as good btw pod x live and xtpro the hd models are noticeably better . . . and the fizz is gone gone gone the original pod and . which sounded the same to me and made me happy at the time and the tonelab se which i missed for a while but not anymore .i made a few patches for one of my guitars based on having a bassman x alongside the dr . z and it is the coolest sound i ve ever made with this guitar . . . easily . better sounding to my ears than the real amps i ve been using maybe because i put them off stage and don t run them very loud . i adore the sound of this unit .oh and as always . . . forget about all the pre sets . they re probably all as useless as you imagine they might be .now the bad news . and it s significant . . . for some . . .first off editing is clunky like it was on the xt and x live . just forget about trying to use the display . connect to a computer . . . seriously . when you start from an init patch you only get lucky it seems to manage to coax it into two amp config . . .next the functionality of this unit is exaggerated by it s specs . you will almost certainly not be able to do fx at once the way you re thinking . why ? let s say you use an xt or a x . think about what you re used to .you start with fxsubtract effect banks for . . . . volume pedal you need to use an effect bank . you might be able to use an analog pedal but i like my volume after my compressor . . . so i have to do it in the loop i guess . . . . fx loop only works with an effect bank . . . line is there any way you can make this always active in a firmware upgrade ? seems like you could . . noise gate used to be always available . . . don t worry if you mix this with the m as i plan to do though as the m has a great gate . i mostly use clean or just barely broken up amps so i might be able to skip this . . wah this is always available and active in the x and below . . post eq . the x live had a final eq before final output that i liked a lot . in addition to all the other fx too . you need to dedicate an fx bank now .so . . . you might only have fx left . for me put in a clean boost and tube drive which i think sound better in this box than they did in the m . probably because they re digitally part of the signal is all i can think and a verb for the amp . no slots left . what if you need delay and modulation ? eek ! i have to re think the way i use fx in this box . still evaluating how that will work for me .what if you re a guy like me who was using the x live occasionally as a one box solution for a dual voice guitar . all my guitars have piezo bridges . no dice .i will have to use an acoustic preamp . no matter . i have one . i will probably dedicate a null amp to bring this signal into the unit and mix it .in addition there aren t as many computer recording routing options as the x live and the super sweet ability to switch between two fx chains in one patch instead of switching programs is gone . as far back as my old vox tonelab se i could literally switch channels from one amp cab to another in the same fx chain . you could do something similar on the x live . not here . also . . . line why on earth can t you make the midi in and out work as a usb midi interface with this unit ? how complicated can that really be ?in short . . . the x live has significantly . . . significantly more flexibility imho than this unit for many of us at least and ought not to have been discontinued imho . for some of you it s still a viable option .you also still might need your other fx !i thought it might be possible that this unit even if i needed to use my ag stomp for my acoustic side again which i m happy to do would bump my m off the stage . it did not at first but after a while i did indeed get rid of the m and don t miss it . . that said i think from what i m hearing that some of the fx especially the dirt pedals work far better inside this box than they do in the m when you connect it to a pod or amp .my favorite patches so far that i ve made which use the bassman model and the unbelievable dr . z model . . . far and away my favorite amp model evah ! don t leave any room for modulation or other special fx . i m not a switch whole patches on the fly guy . i turn fx off and on . but after a bit of tweaking and patch making i discovered that for my sounds i didn t need dual amp chains that often so i have all my flexibility back . . .so am i complaining about these limitations ? no . because the sound of this unit is so extraordinary . i d take off a full star for this shortcoming but the fact is the unit sounds good enough that i can t do it .there will at some point i hope be a next generation of this technology which will possibly address some of the usability shortcomings but i have to say for this price i am totally satisfied with the sound !in the meantime am i willing to trade the flexibility of my former rig for the sound of this one ? heck yes it sounds that good . i even love the models of amps i know i ll never use for the first time ever . . . . and after a few months of experimenting i was able to make patches that completely worked for my two voice guitar stuff . . . with no additional outboard gear if i didn t want . so i ve simplified to where i wanted to and no longer feel like i m really compromising anything .so . . . started with a rig consisting of the hd and sometimes an m and an acoustic preamp currently a yamaha ag stomp mixed in with the hd signal through the aux input . i ve now gotten to the point where i can do everything i want if i need without the additional pedals and i sold the m . i kept a few analog pedals and such that i just like but rarely take them out of the house anymore .i m only nit picking so that you will know all the trade offs . for what i have been fantasizing about basically an m in form and function with a handful of amp models shoved in the box this is as close as we re probably going to come . and did i mention . . . the sound ! it s seriously great !update ! i have learned that i will indeed have no problem replacing my m as well and sold it off . i thought i d miss it but i don t .update ! as of february i have supplemented this product with a black james tyler variax jtv korean and it s a marriage made in heaven ! if you are going to go with this product and if you are looking for a new guitar check out the new variaxes . totally amazing .i m a guitarist with a passion for blues so it was only a matter of time before i was going to pick up the harmonica . i almost went with some of the cheaper options but i am extremely pleased with my decision . it sounds gorgeous very full and clear and i ve already been able to start bending some notes which i understand i notoriously hard for beginners on cheap harmonicas .as a blues guitarist i was tempted to buy a harmonica in d or a that when played in second position would allow me to play along with blues songs in a or e two of the most common blues keys especially among the songs i like to play . the second position for the harp in c is g not terribly common . however i think it is good practice to begin with a harmonica in c since many of the beginner songs are in c and the c major scale should be very familiar to most musicians . in other words as i m exploring the notes they make a lot of sense to me . at this price i won t mind buying a d or a when the time comes it s not like i m already at a level where i m dying to play those songs anyway . and if i need to there are a couple of songs i ve found in g e .g . work song by butterfield . that song along should keep my practicing for a long time . if you are still reading this review then you clearly are the type of person that would love this harp add it to your cart .
the gate is decent construction and the lever has enough weight where only an adult can open it . the mounts aren t sturdy .this gate only fits in our doorways and this is with the extensions maxed out to their maximum length . this doesn t make for a secure fit in our doorways and it is unusable anywhere else . it s too small . it fits soundly in doors less than in width so measure your doorway before you buy .the mounts do not securely fasten onto the gate so when you move it from doorway to doorway or when installing these fall out of the gate and you have to balance these during installation .yes there are extensions available but these are sold as an accessory and with the combined cost there are other better options available .i don t recommend this product as we replaced it with a simpler lower cost solution . save yourself .after trying different gates that all had high ratings on amazon this is my second favorite . i turned my home into my own version of a baby gate showroom to figure out which one i wanted so here s my take on three different gates .i think they are all pretty good gates it just depends on your situation and what features you re looking for . the key features that ended up making a difference to me were the width of the gate opening and the latch mechanismsummer infant sure secure extra tall gate cost extensions included gate is tall fits doorway width bar to step over gate opening this is the one that i wanted to like because i thought it was the best deal . the gate opening is about which i thought was ok but hubby wanted wider . the latch mechanism is really easy to operate and i thought kids could figure it out easily but because the gate is so tall they would probably have a hard time reaching it . it does come with its own extensions in and so it more easily fits the wider doorways . however depending on the width of your doorway this one may or may not fit as well . for example i had a lot of doorways that are about and this gate didn t end up fitting well in them because the gate without any extensions was too small and the posts had to be extended so far it didn t seem stable . and the extension was too big to add . vs . the kidco gate s extensions add . as needed . it s by far the tallest and i liked that since my daughter has been in the so far . i also just like the way the taller gate looks . it does

the perfect battery charger maintainer for two batteries simultaneously . appears to be well made easy to follow directions works like a charm does what it says it will do . i have always been hard on deep cycle batteries and am hopeful this product will extend the life of my batteries by making it easy to charge but not over charge and maintain them when they are not in use .the battery tender junior v charger comes complete with everything needed to charge your v battery . i purchased this model to specifically charge my motorcycle battery and i am pleased to say that the unit works great . it is a very compact charger and is supplied with several attachments to ensure that your battery is kept in an optimum condition .i made the permanent hard wire attachment to my battery using the color coded leads connected directly to the appropriate positive negative terminals on the battery . the opposite female end has an end cap which can cover the inlet when not in use . when i know that i will not be hitting the road for an extended period of time i simply plug the unit in to maintain my existing battery s power supply .battery tender makes larger charging units but this battery charger is great for charging everything from batteries for atv s and motorcycles to scooters and lawn mowers . because of it s very discreet size it does not take up any needed space . i would recommend this product to anyone who wants to protect their battery investment and do not want to compromise space and versatility .i use these for aftermarket batteries for v power wheels . can charge with a battery tender and fit together nicely
i used this phone lifter in combination with the plantronics cs wireless office headset . it was a powerful combination that allowed me to answer my phone up to feet away from my office . this lifter fits onto your phone base and lifts the receiver when you press a button on your remote headset . you can answer the phone or hang up when the call is completed without ever touching the receiver .the lifter came with a plug in mini microphone ring detector that attached to my base phone and it allowed the base station to notify me when the phone was ringing . the setup was quick and easy and the device took up almost no space on my desk as it attached to my phone .i spent thousands of hours a year on the phone and this device along with my remote wireless headset saved me a lot of neck stress and phone holding for hours a day . this is a useful tool in any modern office and i recommend it to you .i use this phone for a buck up in case the electricity fails and my cordless phones do not work . i like it much better than similar phones because this phone has a replaceable phone to handset cord . most similar phones are hardwired so you cannot replace the cord in case something goes wrong or you want a longer reach cordwhen you need a phone during an emergency or power outage when you want a phone that is reliably located on the base where someone hasn t walked away with the handset this is the ideal phone ! the phone comes with a longish cord to plug into the phone base and phone jack . if you need the standard short cord to use with a typical wall mounted base there is a slot under the base to wrap the cord instead of providing a shorter second cord . i like this ! it s nice that companies are engineering with cost savings in mind ! the phone comes with pulse and tone dialing needed to use computerized dialing . 
this is an excellent double sided mounting tape for small items . however you have to make sure the surface you attach it to is absolutely clean . if there is oil dirt grease etc it is not going to stick for very long . and the surface you attach it to has to be dry and stay dry and it has to be strong enough to hold whatever you are mounting . if the surface has been waxed it may not stick for very long . all you have to do is clean the area where you are going to use it and it will do an excellent job . this is a light to medium strength mounting tape and should not be subject to heat or vibration . if you want to mount something in your car or boat there are other very high strength mounting tapes . if you want to mount a small picture or similar then use good sized pieces one in each corner don t use just one in the middle . this mounting tape would be excellent for mounting poster boards .ok i hate to write negative reviews but these envelopes have very poor glue on the peel and stick side . i m putting a piece of scotch tape on everything to make sure they stay shut which kind of defeats the purpose of buying grip seal which don t really grip that well .i do not find any thing wrong with these envelopes . especially nice is the self seal feature . just flip up the small tab and press . you don t even have to pull a protective strip to reveal the adhesive .
perfect fit on my jeep wrangler have been a k n fan for years and have them on all of my vehicles . great product ! ! !this is a solid versatile lock that will fit class ii class iii and class iv hitch receivers . mine came with two hardened steel chrome plated pins not a sleeve as was illustrated when i bought it . the smaller pin works with class ii and class iii hitch receivers . the larger pin works with class iv . i use this lock to secure my bike rack and it s tough enough that i wouldn t want to lose my keys . the keyhole is protected by a weather resistant rubber cover yet rotates for easy accessibility . this is a rugged versatile hitch lock offered at a good price .i have been a fan of the rain x blades the latitude are new to me as i have always used the standard ones . these work even better they fit perfectly on my audi that uses some new style clip i was suprised that rain x provided the additional clip to fit this application .
i ve been using a dymo labelwriter twin turbo for about three years . i accidentally plugged in the wrong type of ac adapter into my usb hub and poof my printer blew out . so i ordered a new one . i can tell you that for a small home office environment and postage printing this printer will do the trick . the latest software synchronizes with your outlook contacts so it is easy breezy to create address labels for those who are in your outlook address book .i just received my replacement and there s a problem with the installation at least for windows . the disk that comes with the printer installs the software addressing stamps but does not install the driver . if you buy this printer and are running windows here s what you need to do go to dymo s website . . . and click on support drivers downloads . from here you can download the latest software and drivers and you ll be good to go . if this is a first time installation don t plug in the usb printer cable until prompted to do so by the software download .so aside from the installation problem this is a printer you can count on for the long haul provided you don t do something stupid like i did and blow it out with an incorrect ac adapter . lol !it is hard to find a printer that lists windows server as a compatible operating system . i tried some other brand printers and the drivers would refuse to install . even though canon support told me that this printer is not officially supported for server i installed the drivers anyway and it works perfect !all things being equal i would have to call the hp officejet one of the best all around printers copiers scanners around . i have reviewed enough all in one units now to appreciate a great model when i get to play with one and after a month of testing i can honestly say that the officejet has really impressed me .printing is probably the main reason anyone would purchase this unit . the print quality is simply fantastic . printing text only pages is very very fast much quicker than i was expecting from an ink jet printer . so quick in fact that my nine year old daughter even commented on it just this morning . i used the officejet to print out a letter to her school . she asked which printer it would come out and i pointed to the hp . it was done printing just a few seconds later . her reaction ? wow that was a lot faster than the silver and black printer . the silver and black printer being the lexmark i reviewed back in june .fast is not always good if the print quality is not up to par . the officejet has nothing to fear . using standard high gloss photo paper and printing a photo from iphoto i was simply amazed at the print quality . i have printed many full page color photos over the last few years and i can honestly say that the officejet s print quality is one of the best for an ink jet printer . while no speed demon printing a full page color print the print time was respectable .paper is loaded from the bottom front of the unit so it is much easier to see how much paper you have left at a quick glance . not so with a rear upwards facing paper tray such as those found on most lexmark epson and other printers . i much prefer a lower front loading tray to the other types . my only grip here is that there is no protective cover for the paper tray meaning that if you don t print something every few days dust will accumulate and be run through your printer when you do .be aware that the officejet is not a post script printer so graphic professionals will want to look elsewhere . there is also no built in print sharing with the officejet nor is it compatible with rendezvous but you can share it via usb print sharing built in to os x .speaking of os x if you are not using mac os x or mac os . and are still a happy os . or earlier user you are out of luck . like many programs and hardware coming out as of late the officejet is not compatible with pre os x operating systems . nor is it compatible with windows nt . or dos either . scanning is done via the hp director software which you can only get from the included cd rom . to deviate from the standard review process for a moment i would like to point out that hp while having great products for the most part has a woefully inadequate support website . the above mentioned hp director software cannot be downloaded via their website . when mac os x . was released i had some initial problems printing to the officejet . the problem was unrelated to the hp software but in my search for a cure i did learn of the poor quality of hp s support pages . what happens if i loose or scratch my hp cd rom ? i have to order another one . and as of today s date there is still no software update for the software on hp s website . the same software hp director also controls their digital cameras with their hp director camera . there is also no update for that program online even though i cannot get it to work under . correctly . for a company the size and with the reputation they have i expect better from hp .getting back to the officejet and scanning i have found that the scanning works great . while i don t especially like the scanning software the officejet ships with it does work well . you can access the software directly through adobe photoshop as well via the import hp all in one scan in the file menu . you can scan photos or documents from x dpi up to x dpi . the flatbed scanner performs about the same as most other scanners and copiers in this price range and there is nothing here . it work fine has an auto crop feature etc . . .the true strength of scanning however if the page top load automatic document feeder on top of the officejet . you can set the printer to scan multiple documents not pictures up to pages which is a great feature one many small or home business users will appreciate .usually when reviewing a multi function printer scanner fax machine the fax aspect is the least impressive . using built in fax software you have to have your computer turned on to control send or receive a fax . not so with the officejet ! hp realizing how nice it would be to be able to send and receive faxes has taken the need to have a computer out of the equation . simply plug the officejet into your phone jack and you can control all the fax features from the built in lcd display . this is a great feature one i overlooked when my testing first started . i now feel that this is one of the best selling points to the unit and one i did not realized i missed so much from other units .specification print quality x dpiconnectivity usbprint speed black up to ppmprint speed color up to ppmcompatible operating systems microsoft windows se me xp macintosh os . os xscanner type flatbedautomatic document feeder sheetsmedia sizes letter legal executive cards x to . x in using adf color fax yesfax transmission speed sec per pagefax memory pagesfax autoredial yesfax pc interface yes sending onlyfax auto reduction yesfax delayed sending yescopy speed black up to cpmcopy speed color up to cpmcopy settings stand alone copying fit to page from glass only reduce enlargemaximum number of copies up to copiesbit depth bitlevels of grayscale software included hp photo and imaging gallery hp director hp photo gallery hp image editor hp instant share hp photo prints hp creative projects hp quick x prints hp memories disc dvd creator readiris ocr hp send to programsdimensions w x d x h x . x . in x . x . with tray fully extended weight . lbwarranty one year limited hardware warranty backed by hp customer care service and support one year technical phone support plus a toll free number in north america onlythis is a great printer for both the new and veteran computer user wanting an all in one printing solution . fantastic execution in functionality and usability . small compact design in an attractive package .well worth the money and investment .mymac rating out of 
i used this on my miata during a complete engine rebuild the good excellent product from reports although not mine personally one of the best synthetic oils out therefully syntheticbottle is easy to use and avoid spills . i also used a screw in pump . i recommend you do too ships primethe bad it can be pricey for what it is .i would use this in any performance car . i do not use it in my daily driver chevy suburban with k miles love this pump . i have use it on re filling my cars transmission . works great i am happy with this itembecause i have not used these yet . i know they will be quite wonderful when i do need to use them
i bought these to change the tires on my gsxr . these tire irons are bigger than they appear to be . the description has them listed as small tire irons but the ones i received are inches long from tip to tip and about . mm thick see pic . the thickness and the fact that these irons have a handle means you can place maximum pressure on them and they won t bend . the end has an s tip that gets under the tire and makes it easy to lift the tire over the rim . these are well made and will last a long time .if you need precise tire tread depth measurements this is the gadget for you . i like the zero calibration and the fact that you can change between metric english and fractions .the precision is so good that you will think that the device is inconsistent if you take several measurements of the same tire unless you make those measurements in the exact same spot every time . tires are not perfectly round and the tread depth varies around the tire because of braking at different tire positions over time .they are a bit slick and need to be sand blasted or something . i would not buy these for any tire size inch or smaller . get a x cut it use it .
one thing i love about this extension bar is it will fit over the relatively large diameter down tubes on my hi hat stands . i use anon stage microphone inch gooseneckto connect to the bar then i attach either anady dm drum and instrument microphoneor dm microphone . the bar gooseneck arrangement is sturdy enough for that mic model .this also works well for mounting on microphone stands . i use it and a shorter gooseneck to mount the dm for tenor and alto saxophones or a dm for baritones . again it works perfectly for my situations .i always keep a few of these plus various size goosenecks just in case i need to mount an additional microphone and i am short on stands . it s one more tool to make set up less stressful .trust me when you need one and chances are you will if you re a drummer or a sound tech you will thank yourself for having the foresight to purchase it for situations i cited above and those that i have not foreseen .there seems to be a lot of know it alls when it comes to this case . one reviewer says it s made by fender . i seriously doubt that and have to wonder on what he bases that on . show me proof . someone else seems to think it s made by epiphone . sorry to disappoint you but epiphone doesn t make cases . they accept bids from case manufacturers who can build a case to thier specifications at the lowest cost . i have several epiphone dots and a gibson es . i bought epiphone cases for all of them . i found the gibson case to be identical except for the color of the lining and the logo on the outside of the case . i couldn t see any sense in paying more money just for the gibson name . my gibson fits perfectly in the epiphone case . although the cases have the epiphone logo on the outside they are all made by tkl . how do i know that you re wondering ? they have a tkl tag on the inside of the accessory compartment . that s been a few years ago . the cases you get now could be made by a different company . the case is very heavy and is actually heavier than the guitar . regardless of who actually makes the case it has to meet epiphone s manufacturing standards so it s got to be good . this case will fit the dot casino sheraton and the gibson es . anyone who knows anything about guitars knows that the epiphone joe pass emperor ii has a much thicker body than the dot . this case was not intended for the emperor ii . it s a great case and will protect your guitar but it s not designed to be thrown from a rooftop or run over by a car . i just bought two more of these cases for my harmony rockets . one is a single cutaway reissue and the other is a vintage double cutaway . both guitars fit perfectly .if you are familiar with the pedaltrain products you know how solid this product is . if you are new to effects it comes with plenty of velcro to mount pedals and brackets to mount a power brick they have a deal with voodoo so those bricks are will always fit . keep in mind you will have to drill holes for the brackets they are not predrilled .the duffel bag that it comes with has lots of padding and pockets and is pretty durable . if you have a power strip it won t fit around the edges of the bag the fit inside the bag is snug . that said i have a couple extra pedals not on my board that will fit in the pouch on the side along with strings and cables .
have used for years . it is the best car wash going . removes the dirt bugs and road grime but but leaves your wax on the car .this is a must for anybody who wants to keep their car clean between washes . my car sits outside in parking garages and old sheds . all of them seem to dump tons of dust on my poor car . this model comes with the wood handle . others out there have a cheap plastic one . read the directions on the cover . you re suppose to let it air out after shipping . it has something to do with the wax on the brush . it also will tell you not to worry about it getting dirty . in fact its suppose to work better as it gets dirtier . the duster will work even better if you put a sealant and or wax on your car . you ll find that you can pull a lot more material off your car . the duster will easily remove pollen dust and any other light coating of material . it will remove the dust from hard water and rain deposits but you ll still see the marks if you look carefully . buy this product . you re call will thank you !love bugs in florida along with the other flying critters around are a real test for a product like this . heck you can saddle up and ride some of the insects that hit the windshield and front paint on your car motorcycle and motorhome ! use this product and they all wash of with vertually no effort . works on the windshield glass without effecting wipers . cycle windshields become rain dispersing and clear as can be . te front of my camper looks like new .use is after your clean the vehicle completely do not use wax over it and enjoy the results ! oh don t sit on your car hood after using this product you will slide right off ! ! ! !
i have a medium size dog and it s really just too big for him . if you have a great dane large golden retriever or something that likes to play tug this will be good for you . i have a sort of a beagle rotweiler looking mix and it s just too big for his jaw .i have one of these that i have had for years and love it . wanted to order another and needed the one that will hold lbs . in the title this one states size lbs . however . . . .this one is tiny and no way that it will hold lbs . in the further description it says that it holds lbs which i didn t read as i stopped at the title but i am hesitant to believe that it even holds that much . so if you are looking to put a lb bag of food in this . . .no problem .that is the only reason for the one star . other than that the product is great for it s purposes . it is not intended to be air tight . it is easily opened with an arm full of dishes etc .get the large one it s not too large but an appropriate size i would assume after receiving the large one that the small one is quite small . i have a lbs cocker spaniel mix and he loves treats . the quality is great and i have seen at pet stores at a very costly i price .
i used this phone lifter in combination with the plantronics cs wireless office headset . it was a powerful combination that allowed me to answer my phone up to feet away from my office . this lifter fits onto your phone base and lifts the receiver when you press a button on your remote headset . you can answer the phone or hang up when the call is completed without ever touching the receiver .the lifter came with a plug in mini microphone ring detector that attached to my base phone and it allowed the base station to notify me when the phone was ringing . the setup was quick and easy and the device took up almost no space on my desk as it attached to my phone .i spent thousands of hours a year on the phone and this device along with my remote wireless headset saved me a lot of neck stress and phone holding for hours a day . this is a useful tool in any modern office and i recommend it to you .i recently purchased this unit to replace an older v tech model . it is loaded with many useful features . overall i m happy but i ve experienced dropped calls while sitting in a chair only feet from the base . there is a short beep and the call vanishes while the handset displays out of range .pros clear sound from the handsets . above average speakerphone clarity . information such as clock cid cw and phonebook entries can be programmed into either the handsets or the base and copied to other units instead of programming each individually . easy to adjust volume control for ringer and calls . can have up to handsets only the base needs to be plugged into the phone line . extra handsets are relatively inexpensive . pairs of handsets can be used as short range walkie talkies . flexible settings for answering machine . it can be set to answer in or rings or not at all . recording time for messages can be or minutes or announce only . messages can be accessed from handsets or base . there are new message indicators flashing leds on handsets and base to alert you to the messages . number speed dial . up to phonebook entries . paging and find handset functions . deluxe call waiting . if a call comes in while you re on the phone a push of a button allows you to let the system ask your caller to hold indicate the line is busy forward the call conference answer and more . room monitering . very useful if there is a child or elderly person in another room and you need to monitor their activities . registering additional handsets to the base is very simple . charge the new handset and simply place it in the base for a few minutes . some other uniden handsets will work with this unit but only the tcx will self register .cons drops calls occasionally lower range than other cordless phones i ve had . people say my voice sometimes sounds fuzzy or stacticky . only the handsets have selection of ringtones or distinctive ring not the base . no battery backup for base unit so the entire system is unusable during a power outage .the pros definately out weigh the cons . i have mobility limitations to having handsets in every room is very useful . it is a keeper so i have decided to order additional handsets as well as a headset .the amazon .com price is higher for the system than some competitors but they have the best price for the tcx accessory handsets especially with free shipping .when you need a phone during an emergency or power outage when you want a phone that is reliably located on the base where someone hasn t walked away with the handset this is the ideal phone ! the phone comes with a longish cord to plug into the phone base and phone jack . if you need the standard short cord to use with a typical wall mounted base there is a slot under the base to wrap the cord instead of providing a shorter second cord . i like this ! it s nice that companies are engineering with cost savings in mind ! the phone comes with pulse and tone dialing needed to use computerized dialing . 
installed on my rubicon unlimited . it looks good . it installed cleanly with the supplied hardware and wrench . i like the type of key and the lock opperates smoothly . i feel better knowing it is there to protect my vehicle from gas theft or tampering .easy to install be sure and read the directions was a good fit and installation was easy . fits well on my jeep wrangler .nice oem plugs . worked well and enhances performance on my toyota corolla . i like the factory pre set gap which allows for easy installation that never requires adjustment feature
i wish i would have known that the only difference between these spouts and the ones for younger children is the color and the fact that these are made of hard plastic and the others are soft . otherwise no difference . i do like the avent spouts in general as they are about as leak proof as a sippy cup spout can be .we are very happy with the tub . it is light well made made in the usa ! thank you ! ! ! we buy a fair share of made in china stuff so it is nice to see a made in the usa product . the drain in the bottom is a great idea as well .i bought this item at a local specialty store and the clerk assured me the item was bpa free . when i got it home and opened it i saw the dreaded recycle code on the white part . i contacted baby bjorn to clarify . here is what they said babybj ouml rn and plastic safety when it comes to the material used in the production of our products we put significant effort into finding materials that meet our high standards of quality and safety . to guarantee the safety of our plastic products all babybj ouml rn kitchen and bathroom products are tested by specialized technology resources str an independent global provider of quality assurance testing . all plastics used in the production of our kitchen products fulfill the demands of the european eec and the american fda standard for plastics and are classified as food safe . through testing all of our kitchen products have been designated pvc free phthalates free and lead free . recent studies by health organizations such as the national institute of health have raised concerns about the safety ofbisphenol a bpa in plastic products . bpa is an industrial chemical that is used to manufacture polycarbonate plastic .polycarbonate plastic is the plastic that has caused considerable recent controversy because of its use in baby bottlemanufacturing and because it has been proven to leach bpa . polycarbonate plastic is not used in the production of any babybj ouml rn baby products and all babybj ouml rn products with a plastic component are bpa free . more specifically the babybj ouml rn plate is made of abs acrylonitrile butadiene styrene plastic which is certified bpafree . while both polycarbonate and abs along with other plastics have a recycling designation of there is no knownhealth risk associated with abs . i decided to keep it and see how it goes even though i prefer using glass or stainless steel items . i like that this one is not made in china like so many things tend to be .
does a super job on brass copper silver aluminum bronze and stainless steel . polishes most metals to a mirror like finish . very similar to flitz polishing cream .this scratch remover seems to be more of a polish and lube that will remove the surface scratches for the paint . it does not appear to have any grinding type ingredients in the paste .it will have little of no impact on deep scratches or deep nicks in the paint . it is easy to out on and remove and will a decent job for those light scratches . it did not remove any discoloring on my paint such as a stain left by a bird dropping . it ddi make the blemish lighter though .does what it says it does . . . . . .looks great !
this is wide ruled paper and is easier for grades to form their words on .there are sheets of paper in a pack with drilled holes and fit perfectly in a inch binder .ever try to trim a photo with a pair of scissors so it will fit into a frame ? if you cut a straight line you re better than me !i have a very nice paper cutter that i use for craft projects . but it s a hassle to pull out and set up for just the occasional trim job . that s where this one comes in .overall this trimmer is inches long by inches wide and tall . it fits nicely into my desk drawer .the surface the area behind the cutting blade is about inches deep by inches wide . while it doesn t support a full sheet of paper it supports enough of it so your project isn t moving around on you . please note that you won t be able to insert paper that s over inches wide . there are useful grid lines and rulers metric and inches to help you line things up .there are two blades . one is a cutter and i found it did a very good job cutting sheets of pound paper it cut sheets as advertised by i had to go slow because it wanted to bind up a bit .the other blade is for scoring . it put a nice score line on single sheets of paper and card stock . this blade is useful for making nice crisp fold lines . the blades are not exposed so there is little risk of being injured . i think it would be safe for children over the age of to use with minimal adult supervisionoverall i m very satisfied with this trimmer .this is heavy weight paper with squares . note that the squares are not inch . they are mm which is slight less than . easy to draw on . the reinforced holes make this paper more likely to survive rough treatment in the field .excellent in all respects except for the size of the squares .ad 
i prefer shar s overture premieres which are the same price . these ones are a little too bright in sound and not deep or resonant enough . also bear in mind these are not dominants which are clearly far superior but for which you would be paying a set .hi i thought these pots would come without the proper caps it s not on the description of the product and they did so i m pleased by it have not installed them yet . . . they are cts brand it s hard to read what uf are the caps i think they are . uf the standard for fender guitarssnark tuners are great ! they are very accurate and are very inexpensive . i have three of them so i can keep one in each guitar case .
just a basic female xlr to inch male adapter . i use these so i can plug my regular mic cables into my keyboard practice all in one pa .the shure xlr female to male adapter is simply another one of those fix it gadgets that a sound mixer has to have in his kit .i ve got a bag of them and they work just like they are supposed to .now this one as pictured is the mono version which you would use to take a balanced or unbalanced mic down to an unbalanced jack . if you need to keep a balanced feed or if you are running stereo or two channel in a single cable this adapter will not work for you . you ll need the trs tip ring sleeve balanced version of this adapter .these little mic connectors are just what the doctor ordered allowing me to spare wear and tear on my systems mic jacks i simply unplug the cord from the adapter instead . and they produce no audible hum into the circuit . they are unbalanced jacks though note the single black band at the end of the plug so if you need balanced jacks for your system those with two black bands make sure you take that into account before ordering . by the way i have both and there is no audible difference whether singing or recording . just saying . . .
these are a huge improvement over the original halogen bulbs in my car . they are whiter brighter and shine farther than the yellowish originals . it was definitely a noticable difference and much needed for night driving in an area with a huge deer problem s .e . minn .it works but my only gripe is that the hardener should be double the size as it takes x the amount to properly cure this stuff in my experience which makes the difference between dirt hard and rock hard .i could tell the difference it made in my limited slip differential . it was quieter and seemed smother . to soon to tell if it made a difference in mileage . yes i would recommend it to a friend .paul
how can one really rate it as it is used for protection and no idae how long it should last yet is was as listed so i give it the benifit ogf the doubt . . .sorry to say i have never used the sewer hose support as of yet . so i can not really say how good it is . i guess it is a great hose support if you have to use it . sorry can not say how it worksnever used one of these before so and the instructions are a little confusing so i did not know how to use it . i looked up youtube and found out how to use it and it works fine .
a good piece of kit . except it does have problems removing occasional sticky string pegs . it s also squeakily noisy when string winding . the cutter works perfectly .it winds well and can cut off excess string thereafter . the design also includes a bridge pin puller that comes in handy . with some acquired technique this tool does a job .clamp it on end of the neck of your guitar . pluck a string and it will indicate what it is . turn the tuning knob to the desired spot and you are done . takes minutes to tune the guitar . mine is electric . works plugged in or unplugged .
the fender mini electric guitar stand is not made for the fender squire mini guitar . the guitar falls through . i will have to buy a differant stand for him rendering this one useless . the fender stand for standard guitars will not work on the size ether .this stand is designed to work on electric guitars not acoustic or acoustic electric guitars . the arms that support the guitar are short and not adequate for acoustic guitars . this is however perfect for my lp and sg guitars . i love its size and portability .at first it look small for my guitar but it fits perfectly with my epiphone lp les paul electric guitar
as everyone else points out this intake tube will make your engine sound louder during moderate to heavy acceleration but that is simply because it eliminates the factory resonance chamber . the minimum cross section is the same as your stock tube so its not capable of flowing any more air than stock . it still has the sharp degree turn to the throttle body that the oem system has . there may be some minor reduction of turbulance but at most engine speeds especially where the engine spends most of its time it won t matter . i ve never seen an independent dyno test published with a before and after with just this mod . clearly the postings on airaid s site are bs . if something this simple could increase hp and torque by across the rpm band it would be incorporated into your car from the factory . i doubt there is any hp improvement but there might be or hp gain . not enough to feel and not enough to measure with a g tech on mile runs . on my . there was zero improvement in mileage over k miles of driving compared to before . this includes some mile runs pulling a lb trailer . it does look better than the stock set up and it really makes your motor sound like it has more power . if that does it for you buy one its well made and fits great . if you want a few more hp save your money for a diablosport predator or similar . only negative with the tube is you need to loosen the clamp at the throttle body to service your stock air filter because the coupling is not as flexible as the original it doesnt need to be .to be honest there are tons of these gap gauges around made by all sorts of different companies . i dont actually think that this gap gauge is any better than the others but it does its job so it deserves stars . on top of that im dealing with iridium plugs so you would need a gap gauge like this to do the job right . the coin gap gauge will damage your precious metal ! ! ! great stuff overall !a must have tool to work on any car if your check or fixing electrical problems it makes the connecting and disconnecting that much easier and you don t have to break anything with this tool ! !
i ve owned loop stations dm s jam mans samplers and all that jazz . they re all full of crap you dont need . this pedal has flawless colorless sound quality . it records what you sound like . you click it on record your riff click it and listen to it loop . tap twice to stop or tap twice and hold to start over . you can record up to five minutes with unlimited layers . smallest cheapest easiest to use and most straight forward loop pedal you will find . if you need all the drum loops and the ability to save loops for later use then dont get this one but if you just want a good way to jam with yourself or a live loop similar to the dm but with more time on the loop then yes get this .this thing is incredibly cool . double the record time of the closest competitor the tc ditto and about twenty bucks cheaper . your loop can be as long as minutes with unlimited over dubbing . this pedal sold out in about a day on most of the big retailers likely due to pre order obligations and a delayed release . it was worth the wait . you can add layer after layer of sound to build a wall of music . it s a really cool tool for jamming performing or composing . operation is simple press once to record . press again and it begins playback . press a third time to dub on top of your last layer . if you make a mistake press and hold it will erase your last dub . tap twice to stop play of the loop . press and hold while stopped and you will erase the whole thing . switch is a soft switch so there is no click . it is very responsive to pressure . there is a single knob to control the volume of the loop . nicely done digitech i ordered this strap to use with both my concert tenor ukes . it just works .i already owned a ukulele leash type thing that required me to poke my arm through a loop at one end and then put a hook in the uke s sound hole or tie it off to the head . the problem of course is that if you just let go of the uke it still falls away from your body sometimes disastrously . with a strap like this one you can completely let go of your uke it stays perfectly in place . chord changes strumming become easier when you don t have to concentrate so much on clamping the thing to your body or supporting the neck .this is a nice size strap not to wide not to narrow . the length is easily adjusted to work with a variety of uke and uke player sizes . it does require at least one button on the bottom of the uke . the other end of the strap can be tied to the head with the included string if you like to do it that way . in my case i installed two buttons more convenient and the strap doesn t interfere with my chord hand . here are the buttons i used strap buttonsif the thought of installing buttons makes you hesitant put your fears aside . it can be done quickly easily and the end result is well worth it . here s an entertaining how to video that will walk you through it . . . 
these are perfect for shipping items such as clothes shoes diapers etc . these will fit large pairs of jeans sweaters and even women s jackets . they are very tough and do not rip easily and i find that the sticky closure sticks very well ! will purchase again !this cork board is sufficiently heavy so you know it s well made it comes with the accessories you need to attach it to the wall and its sturdy . you can use it horizontally or vertically .this is a very cute machine perfect to laminate credit card size documents . works great and excellent buy . i do recommend for small scale projects .

i bought this seat for my daughter who is two years old . i always struggled to get her into her high chair . she s kind of wild and a free spirit hates strollers and anything that is too confining . . .anyway we had the high chair and a really nice one too . . .but it was taking up valuable real estate in my house which is quite small . i felt this might be a better option and i m so glad i bought it . the height is adjustable which is great because my table has a wide lip . the seat fits perfectly and i can even tuck the chair in under the table when she s not sitting in it . i don t use the tray i bought is as a booster sit so she can sit at the table with us and she loves it . no more wrestling to get her into the high chair . i give it two thumbs up . i recommend this to anyone who has limited floor space or a child who doesn t like to feel confined .after looking at several different variations my husband and i decided to go with this one . the cushioning on the kneeler is awesome and i also really like the elbow rest .the hanging organizer has two pockets which fit our daughters bathwash and bubble bath . we use a new washcloth at each bathing so this is really all we need to hold .what i liked most about this product was that it grows with your child so they can use it as a stepstool as they get older . for the price i think its the best choice out there . mom and dad can use it we actually bought it for grandma who loves to bathe our daughter but has an ackward time doing it in our tub and then our daughter can use it to brush her teeth or to stand in the kitchen .the maximum weight on this product is pounds so i think its a good product for adults as well who maybe need a little extra help reaching that top shelf in the kitchen !like most parents i try to streamline the baby gear i buy if one product can have two uses or can be used into toddlerhood i m all for it . that was my thought when purchasing this tub . the idea of being able to use one tub from birth to age two seemed very efficient . while i do love this tub if i had to do it again it wouldn t be the only one i d buy . while my daughter was about average length and weight at birth i found she slid around quite a bit in this tub . she just wasn t big enough for the supports to be very effective . i put it away and just started bathing her in the sink . it was only at about four months of age did i feel she could fit into this tub comfortably . at that point she was in the th percentile for height and weight and she fit into the eurobath very well . now at a year old and about pounds ! we still use the infant reclining side since i love the extra help the molded parts give me while bathing her . we will probably transition her to the toddler side in a month or so . if i had known that i wouldn t use this tub early on i would have bought a puj tub or something similar for the sink for those first few months .other that that we love the tub . it s big but that s a key feature . if you don t want a huge baby tub try some of the other offerings . the drain hole is fairly efficient the molded plastic cradles your child and the price isn t bad try buy buy baby or bru both are cheaper than amazon for this product . remember to overturn or hang the tub up when empty so that it doesn t get mildewy and it will if you leave water standing in it .
my son loved this however my husband failed to read the washing directions and put in the washing machine . soon after the bottom support cracked in half . the hardest part is keeping this clean ! especially with a messy toddler . also the bar on the back is really close to the child s head and therefore if the child leans back a bonk happens . i would probably invest in a more expensive easier to clean since after my husband washed i had to throw it out . don t wash in the washing machine !this hamper is such a nice piece to have ! the outside it very nice looking it is very easy to set up and the inside mesh bag is very easy to use . whenever you have a full hamper you simply pull the mesh bag out take it over to the washing machine dump the clothes in and return the mesh liner to the hamper . i am so glad we purchased this worth every penny ! i have noticed that there have been several reviews that harp on this product because the outside cloth shrinks in the wash . i have not yet tried to wash the cloth part of the hamper so i cannot tell you if it shrinks or not . after having used it for three months i have not had to wash it yet and i m not sure why you would even need to wash it all the time as it appears many people are doing . it works well for me !of the three stars i have given this hamper star is for the attractive design and stars are for the really great mesh bag which does make transporting baby s dirty laundry to the washing machine very easy but i must let you know that this hamper shrinks when washed ! the washing instructions say it is machine washable and it is attached to the wooden frame by velcro so that it can come off for cleaning . i followed the specific instructions on the label but when it came out of the dryer it was two inches shorter and would not fit on the wooden frame . not only that but the fabric was completely worn out .in spite of this i have ordered another one this time in pink because i really love the look and size of this hamper . i guess i will just have to be more careful about keeping it clean and i ll hand wash it next time around .
these fit both my medela spectra dew pumps . my medela is ancient at least a decade old but the newer pump parts still fit it so these go from the standard bottle size to fit the avent bottles .i have both the super wide nipple avent bottles as well as the classic size and these adapters fit fine .i also have the avent via storage system and the wider converter fits those just fine as well .i don t know what the other reviews mean about leaking . . . . i put the bottle caps on that come with the bottles tops that fit the storage containers on as soon as i m done pumping . if my milk is nearing the top of the bottle container while pumping i switch out bottles . but while pumping i ve experienced no leakage .through a series of unfortunate events i ve come to own six different manual breast pumps and two electric ones . my manuals include the lansinoh the medela harmony and two generations of avent pumps . this is how they compare from worst to best medela harmony manual breast pump . i own the freestyle so i thought that i would like the medela brand manual . not so . the valve system on this pump is a thin flip attached to hard plastic . it simply does not generate as much suction as the sturdier lansinoh and avent valves and therefore it does not trigger let down as well or get as much milk . if this is the only pump you have you might not realize it because you will still get some milk but when i compared it to my avent it was taking about five minutes longer and getting an ounce less per breast . i liked that you could switch out the breast cup to accommodate different nipple sizes and assembly was slightly easier but it does not have the massage cushion which makes it a little less comfortable . of course the lack of cushion also means that milk can t get stuck in teh cushion and leak like the other three pumps so it s good and bad . but the bottom line is that i have supply problems so i just couldn t settle for a pump that generated less milk . it s in the garbage now . avent isis manual breast pump aka the older model avent . these pumps are comfortable to use and generate a lot of milk but the valve system is a small dime sized piece of plastic that pops out while pumping and easily gets lost . fortunately you can now buy replacement valves that are inch long pieces of sturdy flexible plastic . those are a must for avent users .philips avent comfort breast pump valves . also even though i like this pump it is annoying that it collects milk in the cushion and spills easily . it shares this problem with the newer comfort avent and the lansinoh but not the medela which does not have cushion . lansinoh manual breast pump count . this pump is cheaper than the avent and uses the same type of valve so unlike the medela it is almost as effective as the avent at getting milk . it also takes standard size bottles including medela even flo etc which is an advantage if you don t already use avent bottles . still i prefer the avent for two reasons first the massage cushion on the avent has petal air pockets that i like and second the lansinoh takes much more effort to pump . my hand gets tired within five or ten minutes of using this pump which is not a problem i ve had with either the medela or avent pumps . i think it is because the diaphragm on the lansinoh is much thicker . so well i can see certain advantages to this lansinoh cost bottles it s not my favorite . philips avent bpa free manual breast pump aka the newer model avent . these pumps are the best . the most comfortable to use the short neck can be placed right next to the breast . they also get the most milk without making my hand tired . the only disadvantages are that they are somewhat harder to assemble than the medela and can t accommodate different nipple sizes cost more than the lansinoh and require special avent shaped bottles usually included . still the assembly difference is small and i can learn to control milk spill . comfort and milk matter most to me so i enjoy this pump the most . if heaven forbid i need a seventh breast pump i will buy another one of these .you would figure that using this kit is a no brainer screw it in and pump right ? there are no instructions that come with the set . although i guess common sense should have told me to use the ring with the system i didn t . the first time i pumped the bottle leaked on me . so i learned . . . use the ring ! i am not lowering my rating based on this since it is my error for not using the ring .i also have found that i can pump directly into different brands of storage bags using this connector when i used my medela pump with the very old avent naturally drop in liner bottles no longer sold but i occasionally see it on ebay . the drop in liner bottles i have were given to me by someone who bought them ten years ago . these are the drop in bottles that came before the avent tempo drop in bottles . i do not know if you could pump directly into the avent tempo with any type bags as i have not tried it . but with the original avent naturally drop in bottles i can insert any brand storage bag with the zipper below the screw in part attach the pump connector to secure the bag and pump directly into a storage bag . this way i don t have to transfer from bottle to bag .based on the product pictures and product description i could not figure out a couple things . how many conversion connectors came with this set ?this package comes with four connectors for the regular avent bottles and to fit the via storage system . . which pumps does the conversion kit work with ? these are the pumps as listed on the box medela pumpsevenflo comfort selectameda purely yourslansinoh double electricplaytex embracedr . brown s natural flow electric manualupdate april i have been using the adapters for a couple weeks now and have had no leaks when using the ring . in the mornings i will pump directly into the avent bottles withphilips avent bpa free classic bottle sealing discsin place to store in the fridge . that way my mom can just attach the nipple to the bottles . no more transferring from the medela bottles with the awful nipples that collapse due to the vacuum created when the baby drinks .as for pumping directly into storage bags i have used the nuk medela and lansinoh bags with the avent drop in bottles and find that the lasinoh bags work the best with this system . i am ordering other types of bags to try . . . but so far lasinoh bags work the best . if anyone is interested i can post a picture of the adapters connected to the drop in bottles with the storage bags .
works great does what it should holds all my guitars securely . acoustic and electric but not at the same time . hahathis stand is designed to work on electric guitars not acoustic or acoustic electric guitars . the arms that support the guitar are short and not adequate for acoustic guitars . this is however perfect for my lp and sg guitars . i love its size and portability .it works well for guitars and basses so long as they are the clover style . other then that it works just like it says it will .
this product works as advertised but you should beware . these are right angled and they will not fit in a lot of pedals including the crybaby wah .you have been warned ! ! !this can work but if you already use a guitar stand then it is a waste of money . it will work if you use your guitar next to the a table .the evans pedal patch will work for you great . . it will keep your mass drum head from gettingworn and nasty . . i cheap buy and it works excellent . .
my now month old lbs . part bulldog belgian malinois pup chews every toy he and my other dogs and cat gets . this was no exception . i bought chuckit tennis balls in hopes that he wouldn t be able to rip it apart . he ripped them apart very easily . my lbs . beagle dachshund mixed dog absolutely adores fetch and retrieve but he started chewing them too . as any pug owners knows the pug wouldn t touch these and doesn t retrieve or fetch anything that is not foodif you have a chewer get the chuck it fetch it balls instead of the tennis balls . i have each kind available and love them all and they are all still intact .i didn t realize how thick this rope toy was going to be when i ordered it . it is a great toy for a big dog like a lab or german shepherd or bigger . my dogs are not quite that big and this was a bit heavy for them to carry around or play tug of war with . i also had to cut off the fringe on the ends because my dogs will eat it . i am donating this to my granddog who is a labrador retriever and it will be the perfect size for her . it appears to be pretty sturdy but with dogs like mine who eat all their toys eventually who knows ? ?my puppy loves this chew toy ! he got the brontosaurus i m hoping to get the other varieties for him too .he absolutely goes nuts playing with this thing and chewing on it which makes me a happy dog momma !
the product overall is good . we have a crib that is arched so you have to cut to properly fit to the crib rail .this fits our crib mattress tightly and keeps our baby from sweating against the vinyl of the crib mattress . we didn t have a mattress pad with our son and he would wake up soaking wet from sweating against the vinyl of the crib mattress . the crib sheet alone wasn t enough to keep him from sweating . this pad is also not too bulky so it doesn t cause a safety concern . just make sure the pad fits tightly on your crib mattress for safety s sake . we have a sealy crown jewel mattress and it fits great on it .if you have an oeuf sparrow crib these rail protectors are too small . not sure how they would work if they fitted !
compared with most other inks hp inks do seem to run out more quickly than others only topped by lexmark who actually will shut down the cartridge with ink still in it . what can be said is this is genuine hp ink and you should have no issue with your printer recognizing it as such . the ink is very vivid and prints great . in comparison this ink is usually even if by just a few cents cheaper on amazon but always shop around for the best price .hp makes good printers . this is good ink for those good printers . unlike some other manufacturers the ink lasts more than a few pages so it s worth it even if a tad more expensive .this number tri color ink cartridge by hewlett packard is an essential for those of us who use the hp deskjet d printer or any other printer that accepts this cartridge .the three colors of yellow red and blue well maybe it s a bluish green can be combined by the printer to produce a wide array of other colors very effectively . the cartridge takes up little space if you care to stock up on them and it comes well packaged so that it won t break during shipment . moreover the installation and removal of the cartridge is very easy so when changing the ink cartridge you will rarely have any difficulty .if you care to save some money you can buy this ink cartridge in the same package as a black ink hp this would be even more cost efficient . the ink goes faster than you would think it would go !overall the quality of the ink is rather good despite my one complaint that the ink goes faster than i would like it to go . the cartridge provides you with the ability to print a multitude of colors on your paper and replacement is easy .
i have been looking for the play yard that i had for my children . the other pack and plays are too small . i don t understand why they don t sell these in stores all the time . i live in hawaii and have been trying to buy one of these for three years . no one would ship to hawaii . when i saw it on amazon . i was amazed and decided to try to order it . i was really shocked as i was going through checkout . and amazingly they were letting me order it . the shipping was really cheap . and i ordered it on sunday and received it on wednesday . how wonderful . my grandson was put in there immediately to see his reaction . he is only months old and loved it . thank you amazon for having this wonderful product . and of course shipping it to me . i am going to order one more . just totally love it .i didn t realize that it costs just as much in the store near by where i live . now i just get it from the store then i dont have to wait for it to be shipped . check the price at your store first to see if they carry it and how much it costs . i get mine from walmart .thank goodness for these ! great packaging because i go through a lot as they should be changed often . no plastic so they breathe .
works great . fairly easy swap . just be aware the front window regulators are the same on whether you have a suburban or tahoe or one of their gm family members . not so for the rear regulators . the full size suvs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones . the vehicle input feature amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference . the pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at but the vehicle id feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit . beware ! ! ! ! just so you know the dorman and fit the full size and the and fit the tahoe size vehicles .bought them with the cruiser plates and while they did fit the plates they did not fit the wholes on the car . dont know why . work fine on the front but not the rear . also they are security screws so do not lose the device that comes with them . fyii purchased this to be able to attach a high end hydraulic assisted bike rake on the back of my jeeps jks with the rear tire still on . it fit perfectly and teamed with the bolt lock blt receiver lock keyed specifically for your line of vehicle it can be kept in the jeep and my daughter doesn t need anything but her car key .the extender is exactly as advertised well made fit perfectly and does eactly what it is inteded for .
works great nice to have a second cable but the obd end of the cable is angled . in my case this cable won t work on my subaru outback . i would prefer the option of a straight obd connector . note that the angle connector works on my other four cars mazda honda dodge .this goes into differentials in my trucks x s and cars . i ve run lucas in my ford explorer ford mustang ford f and jeep wrangler . formulated for limited slip and posi no need for additional friction modifier . holds up to the rigors of four wheeling boat hauling and the track .differentials are more or less the same and have been for decades . what you have is a box full of gears that delivers the power from the driveshaft to the axle . nothing complicated right ? however maintenance schedules will vary from one auto manufacturer to the other . some call for service every months and others tell you that the gear oil does not need to be changed at all . i have personally seen fouled gear oil full of metal particles . this is common in just about every car . the gears will wear . the only solution is to service the differential . fresh clean fluid can not hurt your car .the best thing that you can do is to upgrade to a differential cover with a magnetic dipstick magnetic drain plug and a fill hole . most after market covers will also increase the fluid capacity and have cooling fins to keep the gears cooler . while you have the cover off now is a good time to inspect your ring pinion gears for wear . then check your fluid regularly and change as needed .lucas oil is on par with mobil red line royal purple amsoil and any other high grade synthetic on the market today .the p arrived exactly as described but my order was lost for days between the printing of the shipping label and pick up by the p .o . no explaination was given when i contacted the company . other than that i m very satisfied with both the p s function and performance . my only problem was mounting the unit in my tundra . the plug in adaptor which i also purchased mated up perfectly with the pre wired harness included with toyota s optional tow package . older tundras and some of the models came with a pre wired harness about foot long but my was delivered with the new and improved shorter version something to do with safety and is only about inches long . the longer harness coupled with the plug in adaptor allowed mounting the p to the right side of the steering wheel by the center console out of the way . unfortunately some later model tundras like mine have the pre wire harness which restricts mounting the p just to the right of the hood release and directly above the emergency brake pedal . if i m not extreemly careful with my size shoe i inadvertently step on the face of the p when applying the emergency brake . if you leave the mounting screws a little loose you can tilt the p up which gives you a little more clearance between the e brake and the p and all is good . .
my dog is very prone to ticks especially and this works very well for keeping fleas and ticks off of her .when used regularly it seems to do a good job . my dog does not get fleas or ticks and she does go outsidekills repels ticks but not so good with keeping fleas off like the product use to be . booo
this high temp paint made an old bbq grill almost like new .the high temp paint handles my electric grill temps nicely .copper anti seize is a higher temperature version of the old grey product . it doesn t dry out as fast as the original . if higher temperatures are to be encountered go with the nickel anti seize .i have a automatic standby generator for my home and in northern michigan the temps can really get extremely low like way below my generator has had trouble starting in these severe climates . the specs call for sae i use this sae and it has no problem firing up in these cold temps .
they don t call it the master test kit for nothing .if you keep freshwater fish you will need this test kit . it contains all the must know tests to ensure your water quality is up to par for your tropical fish . the importance of a kit like this really shines while you are cycling a tank and it s critical you know how the cycle is progressing . a liquid test kit like this one is far more accurate than using strips and is cheaper in the long run .a brand new aquarium will experience what is called a cycle . fish produce waste in the form of ammonia which is pretty toxic to the fish and has long term health effects and possibly death . bacteria that naturally exists everywhere in the air will enter the tank and feed off the ammonia . the bacteria produce nitrite as a waste and unfortunately this is even more toxic to fish than the original ammonia was . however again there is a natural bacteria in the air that will enter the tank and consume the nitrite and in the process produce nitrate with an a . nitrate again is toxic to fish but they can tolerate it far better than ammonia or nitrite .a tank is fully cycled when both ammonia and nitrite with an i are ppm and you have some reading of nitrate with an a .and this is why this test kit comes in handy it contains tests for ammonia nitrite nitrate ph and high range ph . you ll likely only use one or the other for ph depending on what your tap water is acidic or basic .all of the tests are easy to perform and the kit comes with test tubes allowing you to perform all of the needed tests at once . a word of caution follow the directions closely for the nitrate test it requires you to shake the reagent bottle for a period of time . this is essential for an accurate reading .caution if you use a water conditioner that will also detoxify ammonia for example seachem prime this test kit will still show an ammonia reading . this is because the conditioner converts the ammonia to ammonium a chemical that still contains the ammonia but in a non toxic form to fish .this alert is vital for all aquariums fresh or salt water . it is a good initial indicator for potential ammonia problems but should be backed up with periodic ammonia tests .as far as water conditioners you just aren t gonna beat prime . i ve had a pacu for over years and this stuff has saved his her life more than once . let s be clear technically it does remove ammonia . . . but what it really does is convert the toxic ammonia into non toxic ammonium until the biological filter can consume it . so if you use an ammonia test that only tests total api ammonia test and not just free toxic ammonia you ll get false readings . if you really want to know what your free toxic ammonia levels are i d suggest the seachem ammonia multi test and seachem ammonia alert as well .
this product will do what is says it will do . that being said it does not inspire confidence in heavy use situations . it does not appear very rugged . nice that it comes with the mount but again the mount is very thin and light and probably won t last very long . also the wire coloring does not match with the standard us codes . white is ground on the item while in most cases in the us black is the ground wire . where was this thing made ? again it is a good price and a useful product but just beware it might be very rugged or reliable . make sure to read the enclosed documentation so that you match your wiring correctly .glad i went with the chrome and not the black one i hooked this one up to my gv motorcycle if you have just a little know how you can do it your self all you will need to go with this is a relay that does not come with it . you can get it on here or any part store i have made many people jump due to the sound of the horns loudness .this is a great product . you can see exactly what goes thru it and will know when the tanks are clean .
our pup is loving this in her crate ! i love that it is machine washable now we just have to find a pet bed that is similar !i have an older dog who does have accidents . i use this to wash her laundry as well as to clean up her accidents . it seems to work well and is economicalwe bought for our pet rescue ! beware ! they fall apart after washing ! big balls of fleece clogged our washing machine costing us to have the water pipe unclogged ! ! these things are junk ! buy a reputable crate bed like midwest or slumber pet . they last for years !
i have the diaper depot attached to the side of our pack n play and it is nice that his has all these compartments but the larger section that i can only assume is for diapers makes it hard to pull diapers through the opening so i end up having to take the wipes that i have stored on top off and then open the flap to get a diaper out . which doesn t really make it much more convenient .you have to push in on both sides of these to remove them every single one in the pack had one side already jammed in and wouldn t move .pushing the sides in doesn t move the latch enough for the cover to come out you then need to wrestle with it to get it out which is not good for your back when you are already leaning down to do this .they are a good idea but very badly made .i like this product . it s easy to fill and the side compartments are very handy . i have the prince lionheart wipes warmer and it tends to slip out of the top part of the stand . also when you go to pull out a diaper of the slot you usually get more than one .
i will never run out of this stuff ! i use it to replace a few tom filters for my aquarium .no need to be replace and will last ever !if i were to buy some more later on . .i will buy a liter or something to be use for canister filter .this is necessary for maintaining my fresh water aquarium . these last a long time however this is my second purchase because i broke the first glass vial and haven t been able to find a replacement so i had to purchase this a second time .
i ordered different chargers to maintain my gate opener s deep cycle battery a simple output charger with extension cords for charging other deep cycle batteries from amazonbattery tender dl wh v bank battery management system and this unit has a far superior charging design .the bank battery tender does a simple fast rate charge then switches to a trickle charge at a constant voltage with outputs .this unit pulses the battery under charge and features operating modes with different current outputs for different sized batteries . the selections are motorcycle which also works well for sla gel cells or agm batteries standard automotive starting battery deep cycle batttery and off .what makes the ctek unit special is that it uses a pulse charge in all modes to attempt to desulphate batteries while the battery tender does not . this method of charging has proven successful in restoring lead acid batteries that won t take a charge any more .it comes with a waterproof v output cable and a set of clips or rings for permanent installation under the hood of your car . in addition to the leds for indicating the type of battery being charged a second set is provided for empty full and maintenance pulse charge mode .there is also a noticable increase in quality between the battery tender and this unit small details like a water sealed housing and gaskets on the connectors indicate quality in manufacture .for a single v lead chemistry battery this is a useful well made tool .this is a factory replacement for a honda rincon . easy to fill and charge works great . sealed battery and should last quite some time in conjunction with my battery tender jr .the battery tender junior v charger comes complete with everything needed to charge your v battery . i purchased this model to specifically charge my motorcycle battery and i am pleased to say that the unit works great . it is a very compact charger and is supplied with several attachments to ensure that your battery is kept in an optimum condition .i made the permanent hard wire attachment to my battery using the color coded leads connected directly to the appropriate positive negative terminals on the battery . the opposite female end has an end cap which can cover the inlet when not in use . when i know that i will not be hitting the road for an extended period of time i simply plug the unit in to maintain my existing battery s power supply .battery tender makes larger charging units but this battery charger is great for charging everything from batteries for atv s and motorcycles to scooters and lawn mowers . because of it s very discreet size it does not take up any needed space . i would recommend this product to anyone who wants to protect their battery investment and do not want to compromise space and versatility .
this car seat base does not work with graco snugride seats . just make sure you order the correct one .we had gotten this seat belt tighter for both our cars a subaru outback and an audi a . for the subaru the mighty tite was too bulky to work well it was pushed up against the car seat and it was difficult to tighten completely . it fit well on the audi but when we got our car seat installation inspected the police office checking our seat said that she did not recommend this product . she has actually had one break while installing it ! since it is not made by the car manufacturer and not made by the car seat company you should be wary of being lulled into a false sense of security just because you have this product .this was supposed to be a universal for the classic connect system but it really isn t . we had to return it for another graco car seat base .
good for easy long throws . my high drive malinois needs the exercise . i usechuckit ! medium max glow ball . inch packwhich not only hold their glow in the dark but are indestructible just right for holding and chewing . cool and funplanet dog orbee tuff whistle ball dog toyworks too but not for chewing . the colored tennis balls are made of toxic materials which is ingested and the fur grinds down teeth .love the launcher coming with rubber balls not tennis balls included . great color for finding when flung . and the dogs love the bounce and the feel in their mouths .this works great my only wish was that it wasn t a fuzzy pick up dirt kind of ball . i thought they shipped balls like are in the separate packs .
works just like it needs to . perfect fit for the tailgate on my chevy when the oem clip busted .great fitexact replacement from oem . exact fit worked perfect . have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs .
the container holds a . lb bag of science diet indoor cat chow with about inches to spare . the label says it hold lbs of cat chow but i do not see how that is possible . the wheels are nice and the seal is tight .this holds a fairly large bag of dog food enough for two pugs for one month . it fits into a narrow cabinet . very convenient .just the basic small cat litter box . not good for a large cat best for kittens of small cats . i have a large male cat and only half of his body fit in the box . good value for the money .
i ve cloth diapered all of my kids and i have to say these are by far my favorite . i ve tried expensive a piece diapers but these just work better ! yeah they aren t as cute but they work and that s all i care about ! never had a leak and i love the natural cotton . hard to find in an aio diaper . most are synthetic material which lead to stink and build up issues . the people saying these are bulky . . . .huh ! ? are you comparing these to disposable diapers or other cloth diapers ? nothing is going to be as trim as a disposable they are paper these are cloth and these are actually very trim for cloth diapers ! i started using the infant size when my youngest was lbs and even then they were trim . with that said these work are durable and priced right !these flannel wipes are perfect sized for my lo . only thing is these are not as soft as other flannel wipes i bought from a different seller . still love it though for the prize !i have tried several types of pads and these are the worst ! they are very small thick and do not hold much causing them to overflow and leak . i d recommend the gerber pads .
i really don t see how gibson can make and sell these for ! the tech at the guitar shop can t see how either . i plugged this into my roland micro cube and tried some effects . i was really surprised to see how well they sounded . i m not a guitar player so this uke is just a toy experiment for me . if you are really into electric sound i recommend going the guitar route . if you just want to play around a little this uke will do .if i didn t think that purchasing these items from amazon i wouldn t do it plus and more important i have worked as a purchasing coordinator for over years now i know how to save money and if purchasing that are great and believe me or not i can find even cables that i can t find in radioshack best buys no where else i have done a lot of purchasing not just for myself but for business . these ladies and gentlemen know what they are doing and they know how to take care of business in the right way i would like to apply for a position with them .regards ffsalsai used to use to and decided to up it a size to the . . . i like light strings for a more classical and sweeter sound . the heavier gauges such as s are okay too but the s seemed to be used a lot for the chop rhythm which i don t ascribe to . at one point i did have a set of bluegrass s on it but they didn t feel right for me plus i didn t like the way the s sat on top the nut i was a bit worried that the nut would crack which is what happens when the gauges are too fat for the nut slot .if you want s i would highly recommend you take it to a tech so he can evaluate the nut and slot it to the proper width to accommodate the .the reason i switched from to is that i was hard pressed and in need of a set and the local music shop didn t carry the s any longer so i went to the . i believe my mando was set up with s or s but i wasn t sure . i tweaked the action and the s are fine and i ve made the adjustment .strings ahem . . . . are just about all the same . they local music shop is very knowledgeable and they told me a story around namm shows and how the string booths don t really give out too much info and the origins of their products . there may be according to the my local music shop a few companies that actually make their own strings but the bulk of the strings out there are probably manufactured in a mass quantities at factories in prc or other offshore sources sold in bulk and packaged by the companies . who knows ? and the shop sure tried to find out but it s a dark dark secret out there at the trade shows so nobody is talking and making a logical assumptions from a corporate standpoint are probably not too far off the mark i .e . strings are mass produced for market and most string companies as i said earlier are buying bulk and packaging for the consumers .what does that mean ? that means i need some inside info to this bulk purchasing and i ll sell my own ! the quality is probably up as much as the tooling and raw materials will allow so why not !cheers !
it does know when your guitar is in tune ! does it for you so you don t have to do it by ear .good if you dont want to have to drill your guitar for a stud mount . its nice and does its job . sometimes gets in the way of the strings or might stop a tone but it ultimately worksgreat little piece of leather . does what i want it to do and does not hurt my guitar . thank you
very good product . now my wife can pull into the garage without backing up and maneuvering her car to get it right . easy to install . as a point of reference for her i put a small cupboard door disc on the dash . when we pull the car in all she needs to do is get the light to be within an inch of the cupboard door disc on the dash degrees and the car is parked perfect . our garage is a car one but with my car motor cycle large mower tools tool chest garbage cans lawn equipment wall cabinets etc . . . .we need to make sure we manage the space . and now we have more space .dynamat is great it s the original you can t go wrong . i m strictly using for door panels on both vehicles as i upgrade their stereo systems completely . but i plan to put this on the floor of my truck as well under the carpet .i tower out at which is not considered tall when it comes to working on or retrieving items from the bed of my x truck . this came in a nice carrying case that stores well behind the front seats in my truck without scratching anything . i have put on the front tire trying out the fit and it will work well .
i dose my planted aquaria with seachem flourish liquid fertilizer once a week used in conjunction with seachem s root plant tabs . the result is lush green plants that look great in contrast to the vivid colors of the tropical fishes i house in my aquariums .any fishkeeper worth his or her salt understands the importance of healthy plants in a freshwater aquarium setting . and seachem s plant tabs and liquid fertilizer are invaluable in helping to keep one s plants healthy .highly recommended !i have buried the pellets between plants and they are growing really fast i would recommend this product to anybody with a planted aquarium that wants the plants to flourish .my reef tank responds well to this product ! fish seem to love it in both reef and fwfo tank again . . yummy !
not two weeks after i put these on the a string broke close to the ball on the string . i break high e strings on occasion . but something as thick as an a string ? ? maybe it was a defective string as i thankfully bought two sets and i was able to pull the a out of the other set and it has been fine since . now however i have the dilemma of should i just buy more strings and just use the second set as i need them . further more do i stick with the same brand . that is supposed to last longer than average strings . at this point i am going to keep playing this set until its time to change then go from there . i will update once i decide if i should stick with this brand or go back to super slinky supdate well another month went by a week ago and the d string broke in the same fashion leaving me to believe i either got defective strings are these strings are not as good as they are said to be . either way its losing another star . if it happens with a different set of strings i will reevaluate my guitar review and change accordinglyif you buy a ukulele and it does not have these strings you should replace them with these strings . strings make a big difference in any ukulele .i bought this in order to have one in my string guitar case . i like to keep a capo in each of my guitar cases . it works okay for string guitars but not even okay for string guitars plus the spring became loose . you get what you pay for in this case .
my australian shepard collie mix likes this crate mat a lot . i bought it as i wanted something for him to sleep on that fits the entire crate floor so he would be comfy but not too warm . it fits perfectly in his intermediate crate and he hasn t chewed it yet which is great . i will definitely buy it again for his other crate .great and works as advertised . fits with the aquaclear unit flawlessly . will order again when i need it . great price .i purchased the black medium large to go in my pitbull puppy s midwest crate http www .amazon .com gp product b at m ref oss product .it fits perfectly and it is a great pet bed for a crate especially since the crate is her place i am teaching her the place command !my puppy loves it already ! i immediately put it in there it fit perfectly under the divider for her crate too and she was in there sniffing and laying on it .now i can t wait for her to learn to stay in her place . she s doing great though !
they do work . exactly as advertised . hane no fear on buying these . fit the chevy silverado wt tailgate rods .i love lynx products these caps fit properly and do what they are supposed to do . i would buy again .just recived these prefect fit would tell any one in of these to buy these you wont besorry you did
does not work for all guitars . one of my guitars has a more rounded head and it does not fit over that anyway i have tried . though with the arrow shaped holders it works as it shouldthis cover does not fit a full size acoustic electric hohner guitar . i measured the whole at but this cover does not even come close to fitting ! it measures in diameter so check your guitar closely !i like the wide for my bass . fits nice and made well . seems to be secure fit leather holders are thick .
this fits my lexus rx perfectly . imho i feel that thisplain paper is superior to carbon type filters . how long can athin sprinkling of carbon last ? plus you can easily see howdirty the filter actually is and replace accordingly . a good value .great to be able to buy a six pack of oil from amazon . this is great oil and i use it in a european car that requires this from the factory specs .this w non detergent oil is what you should use in your cycle lawn mower or garden tractor .i have a garden tractor with a hp kohler engine and this oz is exactily how much the engine uses when you change the oil and filter . i like not having left over new oil . that lets me use the container for the used oil . ordering was convenient and shipping was fast .
i mounted this as an auxiliary transmission cooler in my jeep grand cherokee laredo x with the . . no issues . obviously this was a custom installation . but with a little research on the jeep forums no problem .i have a ford f fx that has most every option including the mirrors with the turn signal indicator lamps immediately below the side mirrors . i researched these trailer mirrors and although every formal resource including the one from amazon and the manufacturer said this was not the trailer mirror for my truck i found one review that said they took a chance and they fit and worked fine . i had the same experience they worked fine . there are cut outs that allowed the turn signal lamps to fuction perfectly fine and the shape of the mirror was a perfect fit ! !i have been a fan of the rain x blades the latitude are new to me as i have always used the standard ones . these work even better they fit perfectly on my audi that uses some new style clip i was suprised that rain x provided the additional clip to fit this application .
i bought this set for my almost year old son . he likes them okay i m thinking we ll get more play out of them later . the mat is pretty small but cute it s just a plastic sheet and the assortment of dinosaurs is adequate . i like having a storage container for the set so i don t step on dinosaurs !i purchased this while pregnant because i could not see spending for a boppy . i was not able to use this as a nursing pillow because it was too bulky for me but i did use it for tummy time when my son was a newborn . he is now months old and i use it for play time i plop him down on it let him crawl over it etc . i never used the strap because it is a u shaped pillow and is already self containing so i don t know why you need a strap ? anyway there is a pouch for the strap to go in and my son makes a game out of pulling it out after i tuck it away . overall i like this pillow and i would recommend it for anyone interested in a boppy . i do have to say that i purchased my pillow at wal mart for about and it has a brightly colored jungle theme so i cannot comment on the specific color style being sold on amazon .i purchased this changing table in the summer of my baby was due in sept i put it together very easily by myself . when i read the directions i was disappointed when it said to only use this table for babies up to lbs i was having a lb baby so i didn t think i would get much use . i couldn t afford a more expensive one so i kept it . my son is now yrs . old and weighs lbs and we are still using it ! ! ! ! yes the middle shelf has a little sag in it very little but other than that it s perfect ! ! ! i am so suprised by how sturdy this is ! ! ! after reading some other reviews i can t believe how many other people don t like it . i m using it till it can t support my son anymore and gives out but no problems yet . i store toys and diapers on the other shelves . i would highly recommended this table and it s so affordable too 
not much to say it s a pic holder that attaches to a music mic stand and holds pics .as advertised it does indeed attach nicely and easily and snugly to my music mic stands and it does in fact snuggly and easily hold pics .well worth the small cost .yea how could a music stand be amazing ? well compared to those worthless folding portable pieces of junk this is a godsent . it actually hold by song fake book you know the one that weighs about pounds ! . it stays where you set it and works wonderfully . no complaints !the keyboard bench is lower than i anticipated . the seat is very soft and comfortable . however it doesn t appear to hold anyone with excess weight .
great toner for my work printer .for all of us who want to own a printer for our computer we have to find a quality ink cartridge for each printer that fits those needs . hp knows that feeling with the best cartridges for all kinds of printers in the home or office . this hp color inkjet cartridge is very conviuent and easy to setup with my printer . this works well with the deskjet series of printers and prints great copies on paper . i really like this inkjet cartridge for my printer and if you own a hewlett packard deskjet printer than you will definitely need this for your priniting needs .price b convience a easy to setup b overall b it is hard to find a printer that lists windows server as a compatible operating system . i tried some other brand printers and the drivers would refuse to install . even though canon support told me that this printer is not officially supported for server i installed the drivers anyway and it works perfect !
i am running an aquaclear on a gallon heavily planted tank . the filter is very very quiet . it does not give the kind of water cleaning and polishing that a canister filter would give but for the price its a nice choice . i have used this line of aquaclear filters on nearly a dozen different freshwater tanks for the last decade . . . they are my favorite hang on back filters .this is the first time i have not upgraded a filter in other words normally i would have gotten an aquaclear or for a gallon aquarium but for this tank i just wanted some water circulation . the tank is very lightly stocked and the plants do most of the filtering . if you are setting up a standard tank i would recommend upgrading the filter so you have nearly double the filter capacity on your tank . ie so you have a filter for a gallon tank on a gallon tank a filter for a gallon tank on a gallon tank etc . it makes for healthier fish and less maintenance .i have a prefilter pre filter sponge pack for fluval edge aquarium on the aquaclear to keep the cherry shrimp and fry from getting sucked up into the filter . the prefilter fits on the uptake tube perfectly and is working as it should .i recently ran an aquaclear and an aquaclear on a gallon tank . both of those filters were much louder than this little aquaclear . i m guessing that the more powerful the motor is the louder the filter is . i did try the trick of swabbing silicon grease on the impeller shaft and both of those two larger filters were still too loud for me . i am now running a canister filter on that tank and am very happy with it .i ve also tried the updated version of the aquaclear line thefluval c power filter . i did not like that filter as much as the old aquaclears . the fluval was not any quieter and there was so much hardware in the filter box that it really forced you to use only their filter media . one of the great things about the aquaclears is that you can put in just about anything you want in the filter box like peat moss or ammorocks or whatever your heart desires . i like that flexibility .as much as i like the aquaclears though i leave them behind for canister filters when the tank is any more than gallons . hang on back filters are ok but for a big tank or for any tank that needs top notch water quality give me a canister filter .this cartridge is a good solid filter for use with the marineland or canister filter and polishes the aquarium water well . i alternate between this filter and the filter media canister which acts like a regular filter . the marineland canister filter is great and easy to set up and change out the filters . i bought an extra micron cartridge and media canister to make changes faster and to have an extra micron filter so while i m recharging one i have another to put in the filter . yes ! the micron filter can be regenerated using a chlorine and water solution and reused .i also use a power filter with bio wheels . the result a crystal clear gallon tank with a heavy fish load .i bought the aquaclear for my daughter s . gallon aquarium . we are currently cycling the aquarium and getting it ready for a couple of fish . just like my aquaclear this filter is easy to setup and works very well . the flow rate is adjustable which allows the filter to be used from a gallon to gallon aquarium .the flow rate is adjustable from gph down to gph .there is a slight rattle coming from the impeller that can be heard when close to the aquarium . this is the same sound my aquaclear was making but after several weeks it became silent . there is a break in period for the impeller and i am sure the aquaclear will be completely quiet in a few weeks .we are currently using the filter with bio max and the foam insert only . the filter was seeded with some bio max from my aquaclear power filter .just like the aquaclear the foam insert sponge can be rinsed in dechlorinated water and does not need replaced unless it becomes damaged or severely clogged . the bio max is also rinsed off in dechlorinated water and can be reused multiple times . replacement media is readily available if needed and is fairly low cost .i recommend this filter to others . the aquaclear at ghp is the minimum i would go in a gallon . i would recommend the next size up for a gallon . i currently use a aquaclear with my gallon aquarium .
i grew up with four large dogs and my parents gave them nyla bones all the time . they d sit on the living room floor and chew for hours . i now have two dogs a gsd and an acd red heeler and this is their go to toy for when they want to chew . as with any toy you should always supervise your dogs but i ve never had a problem with any pieces tearing off or breaking . we typically throw them away when they start getting smaller and ratty just in case but that takes a long long time to get to that point . i ve seen one single nyla bone last for more than a year . i love these things .hedgehogs are a must have for my dogs whether they hold up or not . i have learned to just give them the hedgehogs on a limited basis and while i can sit and monitor their play . as with any other plush toy they will tear it apart within minutes to take the stuffing and the noise makers out . but i have one pom who nurses the hedgehogs and they are his favorite toy . so i buy them just to keep him happy .i have two dogs . one is a pound puppy and the other is a brittany . both love to chew these bones . they will chew the knuckles off them until just a long piece . that is when i replace them which is about every weeks .
this is a nice little tuner . it is small easy to read and use . it has a non backlit lcd display of an analog vu style meter with extra marks at plus and minus cents and red leds that light when a tone is sharp or flat . it has a green led and large mark for being on target . it has a built in mic for acoustic instruments and a mono inch phone jack for electric instruments . it has an active tone you can switch on for tuning but that is only adjustable over the narrow range of hz . it uses a pair of aaa size batteries that you pop the whole case open to change . if you have any vision problems the display might be an issue . the lcd is about inches long and of an inch high and like all non backlit lcd displays has a narrow viewing angle and reflection issues .i wanted this for tuning didgeridus that i was making and it works adequately for that . the one thing it is lacking that disappointed me is a frequency or octave readout . as it is it gives you the note and cents sharp or flat but does not give an octave number or frequency of the sound . so you know you are tuned to a c you just don t know exactly which c it is . probably not much of an issue if you are tuning a regular instrument but in some cases would be very handy to know . i suppose with more training and experience i could learn to tell that by ear . what ? learn a skill ! isn t that asking a bit much ? i suppose for an inexpensive tuner that is the trade off but it does detract from the usefulness of this tuner for my purposes . other than that it seems to work well . it is consistent easy to use and compact . i consider it about average in value it does the basics well but is missing what i consider an important function in such a device . i may be expecting too much for the price as i have not done an exhaustive study of tuners and their specs . having the octave feature would make it stars for me instead of three .in any case if you don t need to know the actual octave or frequency but just the accuracy of the notes you are tuning this works quite well and is not very expensive .it s a simple strap button don t know what else to say i can t imagine a strap button not serving it s purpose . i hate minimum word review requirements .i was not to thrill about this product i really don t have anything super negative to say but nothing super positive either 
 warning i did almost lock myself inside his room once the first day i installed it . i had the gate handle in open position and swung out . but we closed the room door . the gate must have swung back towards his room door but with gate handle still up . i did not know that when the gate handle is up it blocks his regular room door handle it s a lever one . so i could not push down on the room door handle lever it s like if a chair was under it . luckily the gate has these small footholds which i remembered so i used a clothes hanger and stuck the hanger thru the gap under the room door and pushed the gate away from the door . . .phew we were able to get out . now i just always make sure the gate handle is always in down position even if not locked closed .but it does the job i wanted it to do . it is blocking off my son s nursery doorway .the clear panel gets kinda gross from hand grease i guess since my son s always putting his hands in his mouth . but easier to clean than rails i would say .handle is hard to open but that s a good thing for little curious minds . same with the latches that allow the gate to extend .i screwed the hinge side in and pressure mount the other side . i m not sure if i installed it wrong but the bottom bracket on the hinge side is not flush with the side of the doorway . the bracket is a little loose but the screws stay in place though . gate only came with spacers for the top bracket and not the bottom . why is that ? the screws are drilled as far as they can go in though so that is the only thing keeping that bracket in place .i like that it swings both ways . my son can climb up to stand but cannot climb over it because no rails and he s not tall enough . he pats his hands on it often and still stays in place so far . i installed it so that his real door can still close when not in use . when not in use i just keep the gate open and close the door .we had to remove the inside bracket to get these to fit our bi fold doors . the fit is now a bit loose but the lock does what we want it to do keeps the kids out !i received this shade for free when i bought other products from babies r us .my windows in the back have a curved edge to them . you have to place the shade high on the window in the straight area . well you miss the whole lower corner of the window . the sun shines in through this lower corner . when i tried to move the shade lower on the window i could not fully close the window .if you can get it for free get it . do not purchase this item .i just recently went out and purchased new shade for my car to cover the corner this shade misses .
i ve long been a fan of liquid glass lg ultimate polish but due to lack of supply i settled for this m performance wax . this wax is much easier to apply than the liquid glass leaves no mess . no residues no powders it does not stain the plastic molding door handle trims etc .only noticeable difference is liquid glass does leave a thicker coat of protection than this m however only time will tell which one last longer after repeated car washes . so i will update a few month from now .this stuff applies very easily and it lasts a long time . i use spray wax to make it last even longer .synthetic stuff is the way to go . .this ounce is much cheaper in the long run than the kit with it s little bottle of cleaner . most people use more of the cleaner than the oil . one properly serviced k n filter will last as long as the car will last . i have never had to replace a k n filter . just clean air dry with a fan recoat the filter fabric with the oil and a thin film of k n grease on the seal . the oil has a red dye in it so you will know when you have full coverage . the k n filters catch dirt better than any of the paper filters .
ihaven t had the chance to use this much but the one time i did it didn t hold . i truly think these types of things simply do not ship well during the winter months . it seems kind of watery .this look great and worked very well . only had the chance to use one time . end of the camping season for winter is now upon use . . i don t know why this product isn t already on all campers when you buy them . would and will tell my friends about this product .greatly meets my expectation .the bottle works wonderful really last a long time ! stars ! all the way i love this produce i used it all the times
i have found all avery labels to be typically easy to load and use and these were no exception to that rule . what i found to be a particularly nice feature is the fact that you can peel the finished labels off the x sheet to stick to clothing or you can peel an individual label with its backing to clip onto a brochure or package and the recipient can peel off the backing to stick on his clothing later . well conceived !i never thought i d say that a name badge would be really cool but this product is ! i occasionally have to make name badges for a group that i lead at my church . i usually use the kind that are printed and then slipped into a clear plastic sleeve then pinned to the user s shirt . those are fine for multi use badges but if you re looking for a disposable one this one is the way to go !as it s an avery product i was easily able to pull up the template in my word software . i typed in the names of my group members into each sector on the page adjusted their font type size and centering . i fed the sheet of labels into my printer as was directed by the words feed this end and hit print . out they came !now here s the cool thing you can easily peel off each name badge and separate them without removing the badges themselves from their backing . so when i go to class with my name badges i won t be schlepping a sheet but i ll have my badges already separated in a little stack easily kept in a small envelope or similar container .the adhesive on the badges is also of high quality . it s not so sticky as to damage clothing or leave a residue but it stays put well enough that the edges don t curl up which is really annoying ! .whoever at avery thought this up is brilliant ! i love these separating badges . they re easy to print are of high quality and are so convenient . well done !i didn t really have any idea what i was going to use these stickers for when i got them i just knew that eventually i was going to use them .i paint and exhibit miniature horse sculptures so gun cases are a must when transporting them . the only problem comes when i have to figure out which horse is in which gun case . then it hit me ! the avery stickers ! i printed out a half page photo of each horse on the stickers and affixed those stickers to each gun case . they ve now been on the gun cases for over a month and not a single one has started to pull away from the plastic . the adherence is wonderful and the color is excellent . they re easy to cut apart using scissors as the scissors never slide over the stickers like they would if it were a slippery paper . the backing is easy to remove and once they re stuck they re stuck !i would only have liked to have seen something a little more waterproof that wouldn t run when getting wet . other than that these things are great !
easy to clean easy on my son s bottom . this looks great in our small guest bathroom by my son s sticker chart wee pod basix and potty book .i have two of these pillows . it is basically the boppy but it has a little strap to hold your baby in like in the picture .i just didn t like how the cover does not come off but you can easily wash them . it has helped with her sitting up on her own as well .good buy for a baby shower too !i use this little zipper bag as a sort of gadget purse for baby health things . even with everything in it i can find room for a desitin tube a bottle of mylicon drops a bottle of baby tylenol q tips and a little sample bottle of eucerin cream for baby s exema . on the side is a net pocket where i keep my pediatrician s appointment cards and medicine instructions . also on the inside are a couple of pockets where phone numbers are kept on a provided card i keep a pocket sized record of baby s immunizations that my nurse gave me in there as well . very handy .
the fisher price sounds n lights monitor offers some good qualities that make it a worthwhile addition to the household with infants and young toddlers . its best feature is its ability to pick up and transmit even the slightest sounds . any slight noise in the babies room like a slight cough or even a deep breath is detected by the transmitter and sent to the receiver . depending on how loud the volume is turned up concerned parents will be able to hear these and other sounds with ease .sounds are most important but the fisher price sounds n lights monitor also offers lights to let parents know about the activities taking place . the lights indicate the intensity of the noise and they work even if the volume is turned completely off . the arcs of red light on the fisher price sounds n lights monitor include four arcs and they light up based on the intensity of the noise . they aren t absolutely necessary but they are good for those who would rather monitor with their eyes as opposed to ears .does the fisher price sounds n lights monitor have any drawbacks ? yes it certainly does and the most annoying among them is the static . no matter how little activity is going on within the vicinity of the transmitter you still get static and it is especially loud if the volume control is turned too high . sometimes you can reposition the receiver and or transmitter of the fisher price sounds n lights monitor and reduce the static . changing the channel can also help . but you can t do much with the antennae and there is almost no way to get completely static free reception .another potential problem with this monitor is its ability to sometimes pickup the sounds from other people in the neighborhood . if someone else is using a baby monitor or even if they are just talking on the phone the fisher price sounds n lights monitor might end up receiving some of the sounds . this can be quite shocking when it happens the first time . you will think there is someone in your babies room when in reality the sounds are coming from the neighbors .taken as a whole however the fisher price sounds n lights monitor is a good monitor for new parents and while it doesn t offer anything special it gets the job done for minimal cost . there are certainly better monitors out there but this monitor completes its task without doing too much damage to the pocketbook .this monitor iis so simple and the features have been extremely useful . first this monitor comes with receivers a must for a two story home . we can hear everything including noise from outdoors . the red lights that blink in accordance to volume are great for those who can t see without glasses esp when waking up in the middle of the night and they are also great if say you have the tv on a bit too loud . the nightlight on the monitor with the minute timer is a great feature b c it doesn t generate heat as does a conventional outlet nightlight bulb . our baby also happens to be disturbed by her outlet nightlight when she wakes up at night and thus won t fall back to sleep easily . therefore we ve used the monitor light . we ve had no problems nor complaints with this product .this monitor is great . i really like the features that it offers . not only does it have lights that light up when baby cries it can also vibrate if you have that option turned on when baby cries so you ll know even while running the vacuum . i like how the battery on the parents unit is rechargeable all you have to do is plug it in . this monitor picks of up every sound which is great to have with a little one .
i bought this because of all the wonderful things i heard about slings . i even practiced with my cat before to see if i could put it on and if it was comfortable . i must admit this is so much more comfortable than the front packs or back packs . it doesn t cut across the back like the front packs can . however my daughter will not go in this . i had tried from day one to carry her in this . she screams . my child hardly ever cries and when i say she screams i mean turns red and screams . as soon as i take her out she is fine . now that she is older i can carry her like a front pack but quite honestly the front pack is just easier . i wanted to use the sling because i nurse and i should have been able to nurse her while we were out . she just will not lay in it . my friend has this and loves it . her baby cooperates . she has carried him in it since she brought him home from the hospital . she can nurse him while walking . when my daughter gets older i plan on using it to carry her on my hip . i watched the video and you can use it to help with back support while you carry your child on your hip . i hope i can use it like that but for the next baby i am not going to use it . i will stick with the traditional front pack . these slings are just not very easy on larger women who are a rather endowed .this product arrives ready to use . it took me five minutes to unpack it and click the already assembled bars into place . i am writing this review with my daughter sleeping safely next to me . i feel so much better knowing that i can keep her with me around the house and still get things done because i can wheel her around the house . i used a moby wrap with my son but he s now and i need to be mobile with two children . so now if he needs me to play with him or get him something i can keep my daughter in the room with us and keep an eye on her and not worry . since she does t cry when she needs something i don t trust the baby monitors i would rather have her where i can see her . this is the perfect product for just that small portable and lightweight .it s convenient in that it s small and you can carry it anywhere but i don t think its a total substitute for a high chair . i would like to be able to roll the chair anywhere and feed while i m sitting
these clips are very sturdy . at this price you can use them to seal snack bags hold thick stacks of papers together match up the socks etc . everyone should have these .i am using these to write on glass bottles plastic bottles and plastic bags .they work as expected and seem to be quite indelible .johni like the larger bins that this consists of as opposed to the versions with the narrow bins . i use it to store embroidery floss and paired it with the drawer dividers . worked like a charm . great for small parts crafts etc . had an older version with a mix of both sized drawers but these are much better imo .
this is an ok solution to keeping your picks handy and organized at least you can have one place where you can find a pick as opposed to having them scattered all over the house and in every case but a small baggie will work just as well . maybe you have to get to one in a hurry on stage ? sometimes depending on the amount and size of the pick it s hard to get the pick out of the holder and if you use something other than the standard shape forget it . it has an adhesive backing so i guess you can stick it on your amp guitar wall small animal but i d rather not .works great for changing out the strings on ones guitar . compact enough that it s able to be stored in your case if you want or if you have a tech box that you bring with you .this case is perfect for storing a guitar in i would not recommend using it for traveling anywhere unless in the back of your own vehicle it will protect your guitar but it is not a heavy duty case for the price this would be hard to beat by anyone
i have awagan power dome ex watt jump starter with built in air compressorthat is a permanent tool in one of our family car . that unit s quality was highly questionable . finally on the third replacement i had a good one . it had the features i wanted compressor for kids bikes balls inverter usb power and jumper . it was a worthy compromise of battery power and features .but i want a second unit with focus on a battery that can power my electronics longer and jump a car . this model seems to allow longest running of electronics out of all battery based units with inverter jumper .when this unit arrive i expected to charge for hours per instruction . but seems like the unit was already fully charged before shipping out . within minutes the charging status showed solid green and battery status reported . that s nice when they can charge it amazon warehouse ? before shipping it out .first test powering my more power hungry laptops watts lcd monitors portable fans etc . i m happy to report the expected duration is quite accurate . for example one of my appliance that averages watt runs for about hours and minutes . watt electronics ran for hours . side note one of my favorite thing is to power my ps console in this marvelous gaming case gaems halo unsc vanguard personal gaming environment xbox not included as for starting a car with dead battery i had the opportunity to tested just days after receiving it . i had left my car s lights on in the morning and by start of evening the battery was not strong enough to start the car . after connecting the jumpers the first two cranks resulted in no go . after waited for minutes i started the car again and the car started without any hesitation .what this means to me that the rated crank amp of ca is not strong enough to jump start most cars with a dead battery . i think aaa guy once told me average cars need crank amps . even my wagan watt inverter with crank amps couldn t get car started on first try many times . if it cannot start immediately don t panic ! wait a few minutes ! a car battery is technically dead at v and fully charged at . . v . so by letting the powerpack to charge the car battery for minutes it frequently is enough to raise the voltage close to . to start the car .anyway it s a good start for me on this battery . but time will tell if the battery can retain charge to be useful for at least two years . will update here in a few months .this battery tender jr . is great for anything you want to store or have ready for cold winter .the technology is state of the art .i have one battery tender senior which has twice the power to charge my stuff fast and three jr s to keep a motorcycle gel battery miata and emergency generator in check .the jr s have half the juice but unless you want a faster charge hrs vs . hrs on a dead battery you can do just fine with the jr s .a couple things to note .the jr s come with aligator clips and ring clips the senior only comes with ring clips so make sure you add the alligator clips with your order .keep in mind every battery is in a different state of service depending on age etc . so make sure you check the battery after about hrs the first time you use the tenders .if the battery is warm you probably want to keep close watch on your charging its probably the battery .packaging and delivery are as good as can be amazon direct .get one soon or two or three !tested on a discharged battery and it charged it over night . great for your boat bike or anything that you need to charge over night for use the next day . if your looking for a charger that charges in mins . this is not the one . great product and shipping . thanks amazon
love this gate ! when hubby bought it i assumed we would be returning it and buying a better one . but was very surprised how well it works for our family . we have one installed to wall downstairs to separate rooms at at times dogs locked in kitchen area . it is very solid even when partially locked and the whole opening closing locking operation can be done easily swiftly while holding baby and other items in your hand i do it all day long . and then we have a loose one at top of stairs that we can hand carry to top bottom of stairs again i was sure we d be returning and looking for something else . it is again strong i can put my entire weight forceably against locked gate and it does not budge and it can easily quickly be installed with baby in arms one handed .i feel bad that some people have had such a poor experience with this lock . we on the other hand love these locks . we bought our first set years ago to use with our first child . one set of grandparents use them and an aunt too . i am just about to get a second set because we have a new crawler and i want to put them on the bathroom cabinets . they are a bit expensive but you will never need to buy locks again . we prefer to leave our on at all times even when our children don t need the cabinets locked anymore because they are easy to turn off just a flip of the red tab inside the cabinet that way they are there whenever you have little ones visiting your home . we have never split a cabinet and we don t think it takes that much longer to install then any other cabinet locks . you will have to drill in you cupboard doors but your little one s will be protected . it leaves no room for fingers to get pinched either . if you do happen to lose your lock you can buy a strong magnet from your home improvement store and still get it open . we like to keep our lock on the metal frame by the kitchen window above the sink . good luck whatever you decide .this product does what it says however it is not very useful if the door it s on is one that is opened frequently . we have a coat shoe closet in our entryway that we intended to use this on . the doors are opened just about every time someone enters and exits the house . this product has to be unscrewed and slid to the side to open the door then slid back and screwed tight after closing the door . also this goes on the top of the doors so it can be rather difficult to reach . i am and have a hard time reaching it to unlock it . we will not be using this product .
this product was not for us . we live on a hill and when used the containment area fluctuated . we returned this product .having really long hot and dry texas summers we also encounter a lot of fleas and ticks in our area . we ve been using frontline plus for our dog religiously and never have we had a tick or flea coming home with us from our walks . so far we are happy with this product and will continue using it .i ve always used frontline plus on my dogs a jack russel and a border collie . i live in the country and ticks are everywhere . when i find them on my dogs they are always dry and dead thanks to frontline plus . fleas ? i don t know what that is . . .
i own numerous behringer products and have never had an issue with any of them .this item is well worth the money and the sound is awsome which is what you want . who cares if it is plastic .i own a behringer x v amp guitar multi effects pedal and when i first plugged into it the quality of the amp models blew me away .to the guy who said he received one with stripped out screws and to not even think about stepping on the pedal . . . dude it sounds like you were sent a returned product that someone messed with . you should have been bright enough to just return it and ask for a replacement . second these are musical instruments . you aren t supposed to stomp on them like you are trying to crush them and grind them into the stage . . . or where ever you play . the term stomp box isn t supposed to be taken literally . it simply means you push the pedal button with your foot . erego the word stomp .hearing ourselves the way we sound to others is of the essence in music . this small acoustic behringer ultracoustic at amplifier gives the musician singer the needed outside feedback to get things sounding right .no one hears themselves the way they sound to others . this simple reality must be understood and somehow corrected for by anyone recording music . this is why performers in the studio wear headphones while recording and why a small acoustic amplifier is a necessary piece of gear for an acoustic guitar playing singing song writer . the behringer ultracoustic at acoustic amplifier more than does the job .as the owner of eight completely acoustic guitars i thought a lot for years about trying amplification . i probably never hesitated with ambivalence about any other purchase in my life . much to my delight together with a passive inexpensive hole mounted pick up the seymour duncan sa sc woody an inexpensive audio technica vocal microphone and this behringer at i can hear a fullness and richness that actually makes good instruments sound even better !at least as importantly it allows me to hear myself more the way i am heard by others who will not hear me as i do in part from the resonations inside my skull .one of the most universal and predictably shocking experiences anyone who records their own voice is struck by is how different it sounds when recorded than it does when they are singing or speaking it . the mechanics of this ubiquitous situation are not difficult to fathom .to hear what those listening hear you have to arrange things so as to hear the sound coming to you not from you . that is where an amplifier comes in handy . it aims your own sound back at you so you can hear something a lot closer to what an audience would hear .when we hear ourselves without any external amplification or direct audio feedback we are hearing a combination of the sounds being processed through our ears as well as those vibrations and sounds that are created by the vibrations in our heads . the people who hear us only hear us through their ears . the two experiences are not the same .to discover how we really sound to others we can go about it two ways . first we can go ahead and record ourselves then listen and be astounded at how different we sound from how we thought we were sounding while recording or we can put our practice through electronics either through an external amplifier or through headphones so that we can hear ourselves more closely to the way we will be heard by others .as an acoustic guitar player i recently invested in a small specifically acoustic amplifier the behringer ultracoustic at and have found the results to be simply astounding as i can now for the first time practice my songs until they sound the way i would like them to sound to others before recording them .for a small amplifier that successfully replicates electronically the deep richness of an old tube acoustic amplifier this behringer at provides amply volume for both the instrument and separate input voice along with a three section equalizer to provide the self accompanying guitarist with the sound of what s he really sound like to others . it can initially be a rather shocking experience !technically this at is at the low end of the famous behringer line . although the company is based in germany this box is built in china to their specifications . solidly built and encased in a brown vinyl wrapping it sports watts of power amp output an dual cone full range loudspeaker with ohm impedance and a powerrating of watts inputs for an instrument ts mono connector a microphone balancedxlr and for cds trs stereo connector a headphone output connector trs stereo connector and three low mid and high range frequency controllers .the unit measures approximately x x inches weighs just over pounds and is easily portable . it comes delivered with feet of instrument ready plug in cabling .finally to answer a question i had that caused me to hesitate for years before buying a small acoustic amp it does not make an acoustic guitar sound in any way like an electric guitar . the sound is that of a deepened and amplified acoustic . the natural tones are enhanced not rendered tinny or electrified . it is at home in a room when you are alone practicing or on a stage in a small venue . the amps pack a wallop and it can blast pretty loudly for its petite and easily portable configuration .at a current on line retail of somewhere between an entire enhanced world of acoustic playing practicing and listening is now open to me . the behringer at just might turn out to be one of the smartest investments i have ever made on behalf of my acoustic guitar playing singing and recording .i bough this amp for my year old son who is learning guitar for his christmas present . i thought that since i love fender guitars and since he has a mini squier we d like to get something in the fender family . i seriously expected a cheap imitation of a line spider with a fender logo slapped on it . i should have had more faith in fender .i am blown away by the sounds that come out of this amp . the amp models are far more real and interesting sounding than any modeling tool i have ever used . the amps don t sound digital or processed they actually sound overdriven when you crank the gain . you would swear that there are tubes in this thing when you listen to it . i can t get over the bassman the twin reverb and the deluxe . they sound so full and strong .my biggest compliment of the mustang is that it is the only modeling amp that has great sounding vintage tones . line has tons of metal stuff and a lot of weird niche tones . vox has never really made great modeling stuff . digitech sounds super processed and the vintage tones are terrible .if you play blues rock classic rock country funk etc . . . this amp is for you . there is just enough metal or heavy sounds to have a few choices for modern metal but metalheads might be better off with the line stuff .the other great thing about this amp is how easy it is to tweak the tones using the amp controls . by looking at the controls you know right where you are and what you have to do to edit your sound . you don t need to dive levels deep into an lcd screen in order to make great sounding tweaks .but if you like to go deep you ll love the fender fuse software . it is easy to use and there are countless user submitted tones to help shape your sound .the fact that fender not only included fuse with this amp but also the ableton recording software that is also pretty user friendly and fully usable without having to pay to upgrade anything is just frosting on the cake .i am a father of who normally has to practice at night and being able to have an amp that can get quiet but still sound amazing with the added features of a headphone jack and an aux in i can play whenever i want . i am actually selling my nice tube amp and using the mustang as my only amp for now and i feel like i am not missing out on any features or downgrading my sound at all .the value of this amp is amazing . people will shell out x as much for a line modeler but the vintage tones will not sound anywhere close to as good as the fender tones .
this is a good pen with some flow issues . occasionally you ll make a stroke especially when you draw a quick line and you won t get ink flow . it s a good writing pen but i wouldn t use it for drawing not a problem for most people . when writing the ink line will frequently come out thin and grayish but this shouldn t matter to any but the most fanatic pen people .bought these after reading the great reviews on them and how well they perform . all in all i m very happy with them for specific uses . however they do have some downsides .in particular the ink still goes through paper . not sure if it is the amount of ink it releases or the overall type of ink but my hope was the uf tip would limit this issue . wrote a check today and when i went to tear it out the check underneath had the black ink on it . this also happened on the notepad i had used .overall a solid pen just know that these will go through your everyday paper writing products . if you need one that doesn t go through paper get the sharpie pens that are grey black in casing and don t bleed through .this pen is great as far as gel pens go . it writes smoothly on regular paper . the ink doesn t dry all that fast though so i would have to use a ballpoint pen to sign on receipts or write on any kind of glossy paper . i wish they had a ballpoint pen that looks just like this because i got the matching mechanical pencil but this will do for most of my purposes so i won t complain too much .
highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering suspension work . you will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover .i hate to use the pickle fork . the pickle fork is the last resort for me as it will damage the balljoint boot .i prefer to use the snap on balljoint remover . if that one cannot fit then i will try this tool . if this tool will not fit then i will resort to a pickle fork .bought this to use with a signal generator and works great . does just what i need . will buy another if needed .the product works very well based upon condition of your interior . it will not make your car new but it does work . hope this helps .
doesn t work well .don t know why this works for me but it does . my stomach doesn t tolerate nsaids but i was doubtful this would work . didn t work for my mom but it really eases the arthritis pain in my hands .worked but we didn t need to use it much ! it does what it says it will do though ! good product .
it worksworks as advertised .does the job .
i remember my grandma having stacking cups like these at her house when i was little . when i had my daughter who is now years old we would go over there and she would play with the same stacking cups . no matter what other fancy toys were around she went to the cups first to play with . i saw these on amazon and had to order them for my little son . they are a great little set of cups . they nest inside each other or stack when turned upside down . they also have numbers printed on the bottom . each cup has holes in the bottom the number of holes corresponds to what number the cup is . for example the cup has one small heart hole has small squares and the has small circle holes . that s a nice little addition to them .i am marking them down a star for either not being bpa free or not listing they are bpa free . i checked the tag and there s nothing on there about bpa . i will not be letting my son put these in his mouth and shame on the company for not making bpa free products . my only other very tiny gripe is there are yellow cups it would be nice if there were no repeating colors . that s definitely not a big deal but it seems like they could ve done a dark purple or teal or something other than repeating a color . there are two picutres on the amazon page of cups that are different color schemes . the set we received is yellow pink light blue dark blue green yellow orange and purple . other than those two issues this is a very simple and enjoyable toy .we purchased these for our month old toddlers . i don t know why we waited so long . for months every time they played with these at their grandparent s house or aunt s and uncle s house this was always the first toy they gravitated towards . anyway here s my likes and dislikes likes easy to stack cups inside one another need to stack cups in exact descending order in order to create a tower if you don t stack the number cup the number cup will not sit correctly on the it s top rack dishwasher safe ! woo hoo so if you have kids like mine they pretend they are drinking out of the cups you don t have to be hand washing the cups all of the time develops concentration and fine motor skillsrecommendations wish list i wish they would have chosen primary and secondary colors and ordered the cups according to the color wheel i find it odd that they didn t include ten cups there are only eight in the set lt lt hello auntie the product description says that it is oz cup but i received two oz trainer cups . however i did not return it and keeping it as the product is good otherwise .

these were a perfect fit for my silverado hd with the . but i had to do some research to make sure i bought the correct wire set . gm used round or square coils two different manufacturers for a few years and the plug wire lengths are different . if you have the round coils plug wire connector on the bottom of the coil you need these shorter wires ending in gg . if you have the square coils with the plug wire connector on the side of the coil you need the longer wires ending in hh . the hh wires are about . inches longer for than the gg s . you cannot make the shorter wires reach a square coil .rv orginal hose was leaking from metal to rubber hose area . i had to also buy an adaptor becasue the small end was not the same size . found one at an rv parts store for . cents .there are two horns not one . one is hz and the other one is hz .piaa automotive sports horn hz the are exact fits on the mounts as the oem horns and use the same bolts . a inch drive ratchet and a mm socket is needed to remove and install the bolt . they came with grounding leads with ring spade lugs that mounted readily under the existing m bolts on the radiator supports . all you need is a mm socket .the two wiring harness leads are too short to connect the horns . two wire tie mounts hold the harness to the aluminum bumper reinforcement . you can cut off the ties and use the oem harness to connect the horns but i chose not to . i prefer not to cut off the oem connector blocks .i made two pigtail extensions out of gauge black primary wire inches long . one end needs a inch wide exposed male quick disconnect . the other end needs an insulated female inch quick disconnect terminal . since i used gauge wire i used the red coded ones .the exposed male connector slides into the oem horn connector perfectly . the female one clips easily onto the positive terminal of each horn .the horns how have a weather shield on the apertures .best thing to my surprise is that they appear to be very high quality and made in japan .also nice is that they need no modification to the horn relay or circuit .
when used regularly it seems to do a good job . my dog does not get fleas or ticks and she does go outsidemy dog sees this and runs . but it helps maintain her itch . i wouldn t say it stops it dead in its track but it at least relaxes the itch temporarily for a few hours . does smell fairly good though !adequate flea control though i don t like to use chemicals on my critters . unfortunately sentinel alone doesn t control fleas when it s flea season so sometimes i need a little extra help from frontline . my vet said it was safe to use in conjunction with sentinel .
if you re looking for a really durable stand this is a good one for the desk . it just inconvenient that amazon does list the product detail on the size of the screw head on top . make sure your mic holder fits . . .this hanger is very well padded and the padding can be adjusted to custom fit your guitar . it holds the guitar perfectly spaced from the wall .these have a lower profile and can fit and bend into the places the ones with thick metal ends can t .
sturdy compact yet expands to hold a fair amount holds up well . beyond that it works as advertised . good organization if you need alphabetized sorting .sturdy and strong . easy to work with . this is a good small roll of packing tape . it holds well and resists breaking . good stuff !excellent little book stand for the desk but will hold a book no more than thick so don t expect it to hold a dictionary . it s made of heavy solid wire and is sturdy and stable . a good value .

based on reading many reviews i assume the deminsions listed for this product are incorrect . amazon you must change according to many people it is a flat matt not inches thick as lsited in the dimensions x x inches .perfect . had a smaller size for my macaw . this time bought the lg inch size . this is much better and very sturdy . going to put it in the cage tonight . hope he likes it i give this stars because i thought it seemed great and i definitely received whats described . i put it in my black triple door suitcase style folding metal dog crate with metal pan l x w x h but my siberian husky preferred the metal floor . i d assume because the metal is cooler and her coat provides all the fluff she needs .once she decided that the metal floor is better she invented a new use for this mat and turned it into a play toy . it was destroyed in minutes . . . perhaps less than minutes .in terms of size it was perfect for the above mentioned crate which is why i got it . for a lb siberian husky she fit well on it not too big not too small .
because of my kids painting is a constant . walls trim ceiling . . . i ve painted and repainted .what i found i hate is tape that s hard to tear scissors ? please . tape that sticks too well tears off the wall board . and tape that splits and shreds yuckadoo .i had no problems with this scotch high performance tape . as soon as it arrived i tore some off and attached it to the wall where i ll be painting next . it s been there for about days and i just pulled it all off and it didn t damage the wall underneath .the other thing i noticed is that this tape adheres well enough that paint doesn t ooze underneath . and the tape cuts exactly as you d want it to .very good tape . it s really meant more for professionals but if the price was lower i d certainly use it instead of the blue and green stuff .who does not get the mailing tape all tangled up and rolled on itself or pick it up only to find it completely sealed upon itself ? oh i love scotch clear mailing tape but it is really such a royal pain . i always turn down a corner just a little teeny bit when i finish using it so i can get it started next time . but my husband can t stand the turned down corner . he gets frustrated every time he sees it and every time he uses the mailing tape he makes sure it s sealed tightly back onto the roll . grr ! and it will not stay on the dispenser so we ve had a mailing tape standoff for years .with the old stuff if you don t turn down a corner or if the tape slaps back down before you can turn it down you re going to spend some time trying to get it started . you have to find the edge which you can t see if you re over and peel with your fingernails or some kind of tool if you re smart enough to think of it ahead of time to start it . then half the time once you do get some peeled up it splits and you wind up with a little hunk of tape in one hand and a roll of completely sealed on itself tape in the other . this cycle repeats until the gods decide to have mercy on you . eventually you get the job done and well . but it s a hassle .i pulled and teared piece after piece off this tape . yes you do have to find the edge . but it isn t as hard to pry up . the tape tears easily unlike say a bag of fritos ! i tried it with both hands . this tape is ambidextrous ! it s so easy ! now if you have any kind of itis you may need to use scissors still but i was prepared to do battle and this tape cooperated . i don t see how this tape can be as strong as the old stuff but i don t have a test lab . it seems plenty strong and i don t notice a significant difference in stickiness either .it s a miracle ! the standoff is over . henceforth we ll buy this instead of the dispenser tape and life will be a little more peaceful for both of us . and we won t be cussing at the mailing tape any more .scotch states this is for permanent mounting but i d hold back on that until a year goes by . i did use it for a wall calendar which is nice in that i don t have to drive a nail into the wall . but the biggest use i have for scotch s double sided mounting tape is for flat surfaces . where most people have kids knocking things about i have little earthquakes but most horrendously cats ! my two bengal cats will knock anything and everything off the shelves or countertops . i have some glass vases vertical standing frames and a glass decanter sitting on shelves . i used this tape to mount them strongly to the shelf . i ve witnessed these cats walking all around them without being able to knock them off to shatter on the floor . for that peace of mind alone this tape is worth it . plus the price is right .
this fits our crib mattress tightly and keeps our baby from sweating against the vinyl of the crib mattress . we didn t have a mattress pad with our son and he would wake up soaking wet from sweating against the vinyl of the crib mattress . the crib sheet alone wasn t enough to keep him from sweating . this pad is also not too bulky so it doesn t cause a safety concern . just make sure the pad fits tightly on your crib mattress for safety s sake . we have a sealy crown jewel mattress and it fits great on it .the product overall is good . we have a crib that is arched so you have to cut to properly fit to the crib rail .when my newborn was in her co sleeper changing wet bedding every morning was no big deal but a move to the crib meant a huge daily struggle to disassemble the bumper manhandle the mattress and strip the sheet and mattress pad then reverse the whole process after washing and drying . the ultimate crib sheet is truly that just undo a few snaps and toss it in the wash . it s soft and durable and your expensive bedding and mattress pad stay fresh and dry . in hindsight wish i d had several of these on my registry .
this number tri color ink cartridge by hewlett packard is an essential for those of us who use the hp deskjet d printer or any other printer that accepts this cartridge .the three colors of yellow red and blue well maybe it s a bluish green can be combined by the printer to produce a wide array of other colors very effectively . the cartridge takes up little space if you care to stock up on them and it comes well packaged so that it won t break during shipment . moreover the installation and removal of the cartridge is very easy so when changing the ink cartridge you will rarely have any difficulty .if you care to save some money you can buy this ink cartridge in the same package as a black ink hp this would be even more cost efficient . the ink goes faster than you would think it would go !overall the quality of the ink is rather good despite my one complaint that the ink goes faster than i would like it to go . the cartridge provides you with the ability to print a multitude of colors on your paper and replacement is easy .if your printer requires cartridges the twin pack is the pack to purchase hp tri color twin pack ink cartridge in retail packaging c fn . i always like to have a spare cartridge on hand not because they have little printing capacity but because i never like to be caught with my pants down and no ink to print .i ve had two hp printers over the past four years that both used this cartridge and have had no problems with printing using hp cartridges . this is the larger volume counterpart to the cartridge . paired with a extra volume black cartridge hp twin pack black inkjet print cartridge with vivera ink c fn i get a decent page count out of this printer .although not fabulous but acceptable for printing photographs the cartridge paired with this one does a reasonable job . is not easy to find in stores hp photo ink cartridge in retail packaging c wn .if i m not in a hurry and printing on inexpensive paper i usually ignore the flashing front panel low ink lights and wait until the one of the colors doesn t print anymore . that maximizes ink usage from these cartridges . if the printer stops printing because the lights are on solid or the software refuses to print simply remove both cartridges and replace them you ve now reset the ink level sensor .compared to lexmark hp ink is less expensive . i think hp and epson are pretty well matched on ink cost .despite being very happy with my hp officejet the ink has turned out to be a painful expense . in the past six months i have gone through three of these cartridges . i hate to single hp out but the entire inkjet industry is guilty of fighting price transparency with inexpensive printers and inflated ink . this is not to mention the constant changing of ink cartridges models . does hp really need different models of ink cartridges ? no . it would in fact be much cheaper to consolidate the cartridge offerings . however this would lead to excessive duplication and remanufacturing by third parties .what is particularly amusing and perhaps offensive to some is the enclosed recycling envelope that comes with new hp ink cartridges . this prepaid envelope with the empty cartridge goes back to hp so that it can demonstrate its environmental leadership . of course hp doesn t want the empty cartridges to go back into the hands of companies that refill and remanufacture them . although i haven t done the calculations i would assume the transportation and handling costs would actually do more harm than good to the environment . my suggestion is to fill the prepaid envelope with torn up remains of the consumer packaging that comes with the cartridges .
honestly i don t know how any aquarium could do without this ultra convenient and easy to use accessory in my handbook it is necessary . like many other reviewers have already stated it is a grand item that actually does what it claims to do in this day age of false advertising to supposedly numb consumers .now if it were to come in a color better suited to being displayed right there on the front window of my fish s world . . . i would buy another one . the one for acrylic aquariums is blue but mine for glass is off white . perhaps i ll dip mine in something mirror finished . and don t sell your company so someone else can make a cheaper crappier product either . well done mag floaters !i like the green zone on the thermometer to help you quickly identify if the temperature is in the right zone . what i don t like is how small the font is and how thin the red temperature line is . both make it hard to read . i ll keep it because it s not worth returning but i wish i had thought about these factors before opening the package .i wondered how my dog would like this he doesn t like the teeth cleaning chews but he loves it i don t know how long it will hold up but when needed i ll buy again
this mixer has four mic inputs . it has some fun effects . this mixer comes with a hz filter and a band equalizer on the mic channels . it has a fx send that can be used as a mono output if you only need mono . i do not hear any external noise . it has a durable metalic case . this mixer has great audio .i will start with saying this is not a class tube amp meaning all tube in the pre ampand the amplifier sections . i will also say that if you can find one used buy it . it is awonderful practice amp and can also serve well as a studio amp or a small gig amp . ipurchased this amp about years ago and love it .the super champ xd is considered a hybrid amp . it uses solid state circuits and tubesto bring you your hybrid watts of sound . the power amp is all tube and the preampis solid state and tube . i am not real technical when it come to amps but can tell youthis amp has had some detractors and a lot of fans mainly because it is a hybrid . thereis definitely plenty of opinions out there on the web .this amp has two channels one clean classic blackface tone channel and one channelthat uses digital signal processing to dial in effects and different amplifier voices .you can purchase a foot switch for about that enable you switch between channelone and channel two .the amp also has a speaker out so you can connect an external speaker box if youso choose to increase your decibels with a bigger speaker . there is also a line outto connect recording or sound reinforcement equipment . unfortunately there is not aheadphone output or effects loop .the amplifier use three tubes x ax and x v s . it s speaker is a inch ohm special design fender . if you want to get louder fuller and cleaner you could replacethe stock speaker with a eminence rajin cajun . you can also just break in the stockspeaker and see what you think . some players are comfortable with the stock speaker .with regard to tubes and speakers there are plenty of forums out there that talk about themods they use and the subsequent results from those mods . this is an amp you can easilymod and after a few years there have been plenty of people doing just that .i will say that the clean channel is very nice whether i play through my gibsons or myfender tele . i very much enjoy the clean blackface sound of the amp . it will breakupwhen you dial up to about or on the master .the digital voicing processor dsp from what i read from more experienced players arepretty darn close to the original . voices like tweed british think vox jangle fenderhot rod metal an acoustic super clean tone optimized for finger picking . there is alsoa clean jazz tone that has the character of the fender jazz king amplifier . again i amnot that experienced with all of these tones but many players have positivecomments about the digital voices .with regard to the effects vibratone delay reverb chorus and tremolo the opinionsout there is that they are serviceable but not authentic . it is often recommended to buya pedal specific for the effect you are looking for if you want authentic .if you want or need a highly versatile voice channel with a wonderful clean channel thisis the amp . it weighs only pounds . kg so it s portability is very good . this ampwas a wonderful deal at when i originally bought it in . it is still a good dealtoday if you can find one used .as a musician i wanted both a pa and an instrument amp but i also wanted extra inputs and outputs . this has it all . whether you want to output to a pa or from a pa . . . . . . to your guitar amp or from it . . . . .and even play your mp player while you play and sing . if you need more inputs then just output a mixer to it . the tone controls are nice and the bass you can get is quite amazing for a . speaker . link to a bass amp or sub woofer and you definitely have full sound . certainly loud enough for a man band gig and definitely enough to supply an outdoor party with some music . i know it s a copy of other speaker amps . . . but its a behringer . i think it s a wonderful and adequate must have for any musician .
these worked with the medela breast pump . two different sizes comes in the box . one size did work with the natural flow bottles .these shields work great for any new mom who has inverted nipples or whose baby has a latch problem .they do feel up with milk and cause the shield to come detached from the breast if you do not use lanolin as a glue .summary works great for collecting leaked breastmilk and thereby minimizing waste ventilated shells are great relief for injured nipples appearance drastically improves if worn with a lightly padded braproduct comes with two soft bases rings fitting around nipple and two sets of covers one ventilated with holes and one without holes .pros ventilated shells protect irritated or damaged nipples from contact with clothing reducing irritation and allowing healing without blocking air from the skin ventilated shells can collect a couple ounces of milk if you re mindful of the holes at the top solid no hole shells can collect ounces of milk and have convenient pouring spouts base is shaped pointing out which is desirable for flat nipplescons soft base ring with hole for the nipple to fit through can cause skin irritation if left on too long due to moisture accumulation outward appearance through clothing varies greatly depending on breast size and type of bra used seems to be designed to contour with size c at most
this can work but if you already use a guitar stand then it is a waste of money . it will work if you use your guitar next to the a table .this product works as advertised but you should beware . these are right angled and they will not fit in a lot of pedals including the crybaby wah .you have been warned ! ! !i bought this for my m audio keyboard but it also works equally well with my casio lighted keyboard .just be sure that your keyboard has a sustain pedal connection .this is a very heavy duty unit that feels and operates exactly like the sustain peddle on a piano .
easy to apply . long lasting protectantthis cabin air filter works well and gives my vehicle a nice clean fresh scent . the scent seems to not last too long and the scent is not overwhelming . i like that ! well done fram !i love the smell but the shine on my leather jacket doesn t last too long . i would say about days to a week .
my dog can tear stuff up in a second flat but this toy was great and the pieces that they can pick off are so small they will just ass through the stool no problem . just had to cut back the sharp edges with a scissor every once in awhile so he didn t damage his gums .my pup is a mix of nonshedding straight hair breeds and poodle so she has multiple textures of hair all over her body and this slicker brush works well for them . it gets her mats out whether her hair is short inches long or inches long as it is on her head and tail she has a lion cut . it gets the mats that are close to her skin and does not just brush over them .my puppy has very fluffy hair with an undercoat . this is a wire brush and pulls his hair out in tufts . unusable .
great tub for the money . plastic is sturdy no toxic plastic smell no sharp edges . the hammock is a great feature for floppy newborns . it allowed our newborn to experience warm water in the tub which he really enjoyed compared to sponge baths . once he was less floppy we put him on the newborn side without the hammock and then transitioned him to the big boy side . he was able to sit on the infant toddler side even before he could sit up on his own . at about months he was too big for the infant toddler side . he has always been th perc weight and height . this tub also fit perfectly in our sink and could be easily stored away in our kitchen closet when not in use . we replaced this tub with the primo euro tub which . as a month old he is still using . i would recommend this as a newborn tub . if you want a tub that can serve as a newborn and true toddler tub buy the primo and use a sponge pad on the newborn side . you will not be able to wash a toddler in this tub . i am convinced however that there is no such thing as a newborn infant toddler tub that will fit your baby at each stage and that you will end up buying at least one tub as your baby grows .i got this tub party because i thought i would use for my newborn and when he got older . it didn t exactly work out that way but i am still glad i bought this tub . the best feature about it is the newborn hammock . it clips on both ends of the tub and helps newborns to feel secure and helps parents to wash the baby easier . since you know they are secure in the hammock you don t have to worry about them slipping under water or slipping out of the tub . now that my son is older months we have upgraded to a bath ring . once he started sitting up the tub seemed too confining . but if you have a child that is scared to be in the big tub this tub would be a good transition tool . the best tub for newborns and that to me makes it worth buying . also the hammock can be put in the washing machine and the foam pads on the tub are mold resistant .this tub is perfect for newborn to infant . i am not sure yet about the toddler thing because my month old is getting very wiggly and may be promoted from the kitchen sink to the bath tub . however i can still use this tub in the bathtub .
i read many negative reviews on several sites . i can understand how the quality may not be consistent but as a seasoned folk and ethnic musician i must say that the set i just purchased is quite good especially the lower pitched harps in g a and bb . there are minor tuning issues with all instruments especially folk instruments . this is what gives them their charm and voice . i find my whole set to be of very adequate quality and i will not need replacement harps right away as many have stated they had to do . the set is quite nice for the price !a good value box set of quality products . use these each time you re string and keep your instrument in top shape . i do guitar set ups for folks and these come in real handy .these are descent quality cables . great price i own many of these . just a good basic cable . love the price and they shipped quickly .
these worked with the medela breast pump . two different sizes comes in the box . one size did work with the natural flow bottles .i did not buy this but i have the medela pump in style . thanks to those who mentioned that the evenflo nipples would fit the bottles but it s the evenflo classic nipples that fit not the evenflo elite nipples . now i just need to find caps that would fit without having to buy this whole set .the kit came with two sets of adapters to connect directly from the medela pump to most bottles the one pair fits avent old new style natural bottles perfectly . so much more convenient to pump directly into normal oz bottles !
the listing for this item can be confusing if you are not sure what stereo xlr is . stereo xlr is meant to be similar to your stereo headphones where left and right are separate unbalanced wires . this cable is configured to be a stereo unbalanced xlr to a stereo unbalanced trs cable . this item is not a mono balanced xlr to a stereo unbalanced mic cable .a little bit a soldering can fix this connector by moving the red wire from ping to pin with the white wire . pin then ties to pin with the ground wire .the dunlop strap locks work pretty well but the standard hole cut in a standard leather strap is not big enough to accomidate the locking buttons . the strap has to be modified by increasing the size of the holes . this for all intents and purposes means that you will not be able to use that strap with standard strap buttons ever again .they do work as advertised and they are easy to take on and off for strap adjustment when required .it s a well build daisy chain dc power cable . it has good lenght between two plugs . you won t have difficulties to plug your pedals .
the specifications state x . x . inches . with the wheels it measures . in height . of course it will not slide into my pantry at that height .now i either place it outside in an unsightly plain view position or drag it in and out of the pantry . i will bet in a few months that the unit breaks after pushing and pulling since the plastic is sort of brittle . the corners of the wheels are flimsy and not engineered well enough for the added stress of daily maneuvering where the wheels attach to the unit .seriously pass this if you are on the bubble of a decision .fit my gallon long wide high just right . the two glass pieces came already inserted into the plastic piece that allows the glass to be lifted for feeding . the other extra plastic piece goes onto the rear glass piece in case you have filters in the back and need to cut slots out for them . however i don t use that plastic piece and have a inch and a half space that fits well for my filter and heater . it also comes with an attachable handle that makes it easier to lift the glass .i used these to modify my penguin filters to add a pre filter . just remove the cap on the end and put some of these pieces together until it fits . mine sit sideways in the tank . one pointing to the right and one pointing to the left . you can position them any way you want though .
i love the surface of this mousepad . the mouse glides across it smoothly and it even works well with the old ball type mice i have one that i don t use but had to test . the mouse pad itself is very sturdy . if you were on the road or something you could mouse on a bed or sofa cushion .the pad annoyed me at first . i could not get it adjusted right . finally i threw away the plastic velcro stuff and just used plain doublesided tape to stick it to the mousepad in a comfortable position . the tape holds up fine .the wrist pad is very thick but not too soft . the faux leather does not stick to skin or clothing . i wish the pad was just a little softer but the support is good .antimicrobial is very good for an office especially if you eat at your desk . i d also recommended wiping everything down once in awhile to keep germs at bay .i also like how it looks on my desk . very professional looking .it s a silly thing but late last year i found myself in need of a mouse pad . and so out i went to check on what type i could pick up knowing that the pad would only cost two or three dollars tops . what i ran into was a series of mouse pads that for one reason or another did not meet my wishes . most were thick ugly and or cheap looking some were extrememly heavy and others had unattractive pictures or logos on them . i nearly gave up thinking i would continue to do my mousing on my desk without anything beneath it .and then i ran into the wowpad . i do have to confess that my first emotion upon seeing this pad was outrage that such a trivial component could cost nearly ten dollars . in fact i was incensed . but being desperate i picked it up and started examining it and i was quite surprised at how my perception of this pad changed as i did .first this mouse pad is remarkably thin . it feels as though it might be the thickness of a piece of heavy cardstock paper but certainly nothing more . that was intriguing . the surface felt unusual in that it had a surface not unlike teflon but with a plastic feel . it also had a stiffness to it not unlike cardstock perhaps a bit more stiff but certainly flexible enough to where it can be bent . ok so out of desperation i purchased one grumbling the whole way through the purchase process because i was paying ten dollars for a mouse pad .when i actually tried the mouse pad out i was tremendously surprised . the surface finish coupled with the extreme thinness of the pad made mousing an entirely new experience . the mouse glides over the surface and the pad s thinness allow you to place the pad almost anywhere even if you need to put part of your laptop over the pad because of space constraints . and a surprise if you spill something on the pad you simply wipe it up or clean it with a damp cloth and it appears as though you might possibly be even able to wash the pad with soap and water over the sink if needed because the construction seems generally impervious to such accidents .this is clearly the best mouse pad i have ever used . its outstanding characteristics make mousing easier than ever before and the physical form factor and visual appearance of the pad make it so that you will find yourself carrying it with you wherever you go note that this pad can be purchased in a large size for home use or a smaller size for use with a laptop . it s so good in fact that i purchased a second one so that i can have them in different locations where i work . this is a five star product . if you are looking for a mouse pad i can heartily recommend it without hesitation . yes it s costly but you likely won t regret the purchase once you start using it .before i would always have to hunt around for rubber bands . it s nice having this ball and i don t think we ll ever run out of rubber bands anymore . the rubber bands seem pretty average to me they stretch like i would expect them to stretch that is they don t seem to be overly tight or loose and they feel strong enough .someone complained about the rubber bands nearer the inside and that they were more fragile . i haven t taken off that many and don t intend to because once i do i know i ll be too lazy to try and reform the ball and i will also probably misplace all the rubber bands i took off . i am curious though as to just how they make a ball like this in the first place . some day in the distant future when i ve used most of the rubber bands i suppose i will find out .for now it is a nice product to have . very convenient . oh and if you want to use it for a rubber ball be aware that it does bounce pretty good and the rubber bands don t come flying off .
i purchased this about two weeks ago and have already used it several times . i m just wrapping up my graduate education and wish i knew about this sooner . if you present in teams and usually have someone controlling the slides you know how its difficult to sync your presentation with the other person . the logitech presenter puts the control into your hands . this also allows you to step away from the computer and focus on the actual presentation than changing the slides .this unit does the following start presentation exit presentation black out the screen good for when you want to have people focus their attention on you instead of the slides forward back to navigate through slides volume control laser pointer time limit notification warnings at mins and mins also comes with a compact fabric case .contrary to what a previous reviewer stated this receiver is not a usb bluetooth receiver . it is only usb and transmits at a . ghz frequency .as some others have stated this is not a mouse . the more expensive logitech presenter that costs over can double as a mouse .i have only utilized the presenter with powerpoint . i do not know if it is compatible with other presentation software .pros the buttons are well positioned making it very easy to learn . very light fits comfortably in hand the usb receiver is compact and can be stored within the presenter . i like the fact that it is so compact because on certain laptops the usb slots are stacked on top of one another . with some other over sized usb cords receivers it can cause trouble connecting both simultaneously . the compactness of the receiver is perfect ! battery indicator comes with batteries the laser pointer can double as a toy to play with a cat . my cat chases the red laserbeam all around the room . who knew the presenter could be so much fun ? cons time limit notifications can only be increased in minute increments . the usb receiver can easily be put into the presenter in the wrong way making it somewhat difficult to take out . did not work on a couple older laptops . they were both running winxp . however these could be isolated incidents . took at least seconds on new systems for the presenter to be recognized and set up . no resume feature the fabric case should have come with a belt clipi took the logitech presenter to class and fellow classmates loved it so much they all wanted to use it . they were able to learn it on the fly . this unit is money well spent !the best thing about this calculator is that it s got a cover that latches . no it doesn t lock but that little hard plastic door closes over the keypad so when i toss it into my briefcase and head out i don t have to worry about damage to the keypad or the thing being turned on and staying on as a stray pen or something just keeps pushing its buttons . the main power source is light but it s got a simple battery backup the batteries being accessible when you pull two small philips head screws from the back of the case .this thing is small and mobile and is perfect for my mobile business needs . i m not going to be plotting spacecraft trajectories or formulating amino acid degradations today so i don t need anything more than the basic arithmetic functions it offers as well as square root and basic memory functions .the buttons are just the right size not so big that i feel like this thing is a learning toy for a year old or has been made for the myopic over set . the buttons are big enough that i can quickly tap out my work without mashing down multiple buttons .to conclude if you want a small calc you can tote with you and that will not let you down by running out of power this is the one . if you re after a reliable little machine to crank out your daily checkbook totals or to tally up the pro rating on your timesheet entries then this is the one you want . recommend .as a computer developer i can spend several hours at my desk working away . but i can t sit still so i find myself changing position frequently . i had been using my speaker as a foot rest but it doesn t change with me at all .this foot rest from m is great . it has plenty of room where i can move my feet around . you can change the tilt easily with your feet . the height adjustment is easily accomplished with a set of wing nuts no tools required . it should last forever it is made from sturdy metal with a nice rubber pad to rest your feet on .it is much more comfortable then my speaker !
great tool for clamping hard to reach radiator hose clamps . its multi position locking mechanism will make sure to clamp and hold various sized clamps unlike other pliers that can only hold in the fully close position .i should have gotten the honda cap . this fits ok but the screws are not captured in the cap . with the original cap the screws cannot fall out . considering the position of the screws when mounting this captured screws are an advantage .the picture is slightly misleading . this is only the mounting bracket it does not come with any wiring . but is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a wire flat cable . the bracket is flat on one side and curved on the other . the curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch . the connector on the end of my t connector fits well and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket . it sure beets having the connector flopping around !
i bought these just to compare them to my bumkins and bummis prefolds and they turned out to be not as absorbent as either . i used them a couple of times and have just decided to put them in storage . they are also impossible to use with the snappis fastner . definitely not usable overnight .while these containers are made for breast milk storage we use them for food storage including yogurt and applesauce .we haven t had issues with the food leaking and we love that these containers stack so nicely . both in the fridge and in the cupboard .if i had to freeze breastmilk this was great because i didn t have to put a lot of plastic containers in the freezer we could use them to feed the baby instead . they were easy to dispose of if they outdated there is a place to label them with the date . i usually put of them in a freezer bag as a double layer of protection against leaks and freezer burn . none ever leaked for me . they thaw easier and faster than in hard plastic or glass containers too . very convenient .
if your printer requires cartridges the twin pack is the pack to purchase hp tri color twin pack ink cartridge in retail packaging c fn . i always like to have a spare cartridge on hand not because they have little printing capacity but because i never like to be caught with my pants down and no ink to print .i ve had two hp printers over the past four years that both used this cartridge and have had no problems with printing using hp cartridges . this is the larger volume counterpart to the cartridge . paired with a extra volume black cartridge hp twin pack black inkjet print cartridge with vivera ink c fn i get a decent page count out of this printer .although not fabulous but acceptable for printing photographs the cartridge paired with this one does a reasonable job . is not easy to find in stores hp photo ink cartridge in retail packaging c wn .if i m not in a hurry and printing on inexpensive paper i usually ignore the flashing front panel low ink lights and wait until the one of the colors doesn t print anymore . that maximizes ink usage from these cartridges . if the printer stops printing because the lights are on solid or the software refuses to print simply remove both cartridges and replace them you ve now reset the ink level sensor .compared to lexmark hp ink is less expensive . i think hp and epson are pretty well matched on ink cost .i have a canon photo printer canon pixma ip d photo printer that uses both the cl canon cl high capacity color ink cartridge and the cl canon cl photo ink cartridge . i have used this for more than a year now the ink dries fast no smears no clogging issues they just work and what more can you ask for from one of these . i print photographs and a few dvd labels on this and would recommend this solution and this ink to anyone needing a quick low expense solution .i bought these canon pgi bk pack pigment black ink tanks for my canon ip pixma printer .pros reliabilitythese ink cartridge are very reliable . i ve yet to encounter a fail ink cartridge that the printer has to reject ink usageat the lowest quality mode i can print about a ream s worth of paper double sided .cons expensive inkthese printer cartridges are expensive . my printer usescyan cli c magenta cli m yellow cli y also sold as amultipack and the two black cartridges pgi andcli black also sold as amultipack .since my printer uses all of the color ink cartridges at about the same rate even in grayscale mode the price of ink cartridge replacements can be a lttle steep . i ve never had a problem with the canon pgi bk ink tanks . the main gripe i have is the high price ink cartridge replacements .
these are standard envelopes that work just as one would expect they should . the only thing that they could have added is a tear off sticker that reveals the sealing glue . instead i have to lick the sealing glue in order to get the envelope cover to stick to the envelope body .i have found all avery labels to be typically easy to load and use and these were no exception to that rule . what i found to be a particularly nice feature is the fact that you can peel the finished labels off the x sheet to stick to clothing or you can peel an individual label with its backing to clip onto a brochure or package and the recipient can peel off the backing to stick on his clothing later . well conceived !these sturdy mailing envelopes by kraft have an excellent internal lining of bubble wrap to make whatever you re mailing get to its destination safely ! i sometimes mail cds or dvds to friends and i wouldn t be able to do it without these excellent envelopes with their bubble wrap lining .of course the bubble wrap inside the envelope simultaneously serves as padding and the envelopes are padded somewhat more as well to make the insides safe for cd cases and the like . just as they say the bubble wrap lining runs all the way to the flap of the envelope . this is far superior to the regular envelope or a thin cardboard envelope which really offers little or no protection against the contents being broken should the envelope be accidentally dropped or just banged around in transit .the sealing to each envelope is easy just pull off the strip on the envelope s edge and press down hard . if you have any remaining concerns about the envelope staying shut in transit just use some tape to reinforce the seal of the envelope .moreover these envelopes come cheap . as i write this they cost just about cents an envelope who could ask for anything more in this department !one suggestion write the name and address of the recipient on the envelope before you insert the contents and seal it . that way you re protected even more against the envelope accidentally becoming less padded by the force of any ink pen you use to write with .overall envelopes like these count for a lot . i am always mailing something and they sure do come in handy ! i have also received tons of packages over the years from sellers of cds and dvds who used these envelopes to reliably transport the media to me .i highly recommend these envelopes . great job kraft !
i started using this for my cats and dogs the cats would hardly touch their food with this on it so i stopped . the dogs eat like normal but i notice they go for the spots with the oil first . i definitely notice the shine in my cane corso s coat not so much in the mutt s coat as she s shedding her winter coat at the moment . there are no negative effects to keeping them on this long term so it ll only improve their coats and help with joints long term .works great for new puppies . stays warm as it advertises . i would highly recommend this product to people who breed dogs .i use this for my dog s coat that was very dry and my cat s constipation . great product . pets love the taste .
the gm bumper connector has its own cap to keep the weather out and so does this adapter . but i really wouldn t leave this adapter plugged in all the time because the gm connector then is not sealed .this adapter fits well with a locating keyway that fits the groove of the gm connector aligning all the pins correctly . it s a tight fit so that it won t fall out in case the cable to your trailer has enough weight to tug on this adapter to any significant degree .i don t have any illumination problems so the led functions are not fully tested . frankly i do a walk around after hooking up anyway with marker lights and flashers on to check that everything works . i presume the leds will tell me if there s an issue some day .the picture is slightly misleading . this is only the mounting bracket it does not come with any wiring . but is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a wire flat cable . the bracket is flat on one side and curved on the other . the curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch . the connector on the end of my t connector fits well and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket . it sure beets having the connector flopping around !this stuff is great for keeping threads lubed up so they are easy to install remove . i used some on my new spark plugs and on my battery clamp . my old plugs were very hard to get out because they didn t have any of this stuff . now the battery clamp and plugs will come out very easily . it does have a strong smell to it .
decent price for all necessary colors and genuine canon ink cartridge . also comes with a pack of photo paper .i have a canon photo printer which takes six cli canon ink cartridges . the cost of each individual ink cartridge ranges from around on amazon to . in staples . so no matter how you buy the genuine canon ink cartridges keeping yourself ready to print photos is expensive .you can get a better per cartridge of you buy them incanon cli color multipack ink tanks . in that case each individual cartridge is a little less expensive . canon package cl c cyan cl m magenta cl y yellow and cl bk black as a pack on amazon . when cartridges are sold in packs you might think those colors are used at similar rates . . . but that is not so .i have kept track of the usage of the cartridges over a long period of time and would like to share these results with you .number of cartridges usedcl m magenta cl y yellow cl b black cl pc photo cyan cl pm photo magenta my usage shows that yellow is used the most followed closely by photo magenta followed next by black and photo cyan and trailed by cyan and magenta . note that i have a laser printer that i used for text otherwise the usage of the black cartridge would have been a lot higher .i buy most of my color photo ink on line from amazon . however now that staples began again accepting cl cartridges for staples rewards in their recycling empty cartridges program i wanted to analyze my usage to see which cartridges i should buy at staples using my staples rewards .my original thought was to buycanon cli pc photo cyan ink tankandcanon cli pm photo magenta ink tanksince they don t come in a pack . but given the usage chart above it is clear that i should buy extra yellow and photo magenta .this is a genuine hp replacement cartridge . as such it works perfectly . no complaints whatsoever .
this cover does not fit a full size acoustic electric hohner guitar . i measured the whole at but this cover does not even come close to fitting ! it measures in diameter so check your guitar closely !if you are familiar with the pedaltrain products you know how solid this product is . if you are new to effects it comes with plenty of velcro to mount pedals and brackets to mount a power brick they have a deal with voodoo so those bricks are will always fit . keep in mind you will have to drill holes for the brackets they are not predrilled .the duffel bag that it comes with has lots of padding and pockets and is pretty durable . if you have a power strip it won t fit around the edges of the bag the fit inside the bag is snug . that said i have a couple extra pedals not on my board that will fit in the pouch on the side along with strings and cables .just got three of these in today and compared one to a used fender standard one strap bag i also got in at the same time .the chromacast has thicker padding that is covered with cloth on the inside while the fender does not go thisextra step . the chromacast also has many more pockets .the specs on the fender and chromacast do not back up reality as the fender advertizes mm padding and the chromacast advertizes mm padding . someone is not telling the truth here and i think it is fender .this is a good medium class gig bag that falls somewhere in between a dust bag like the burswood and a deluxe mm padded bag .the only thing the bag is missing is a hanger on the back which the fender does have .chromacast should get rid of the plastic expensive hand grip on the front of the bag and just sew on a hanger on the back like everyone else .this bag is good for in house and light use no throwing it around transport .if you are gigging use a deluxe bag or a hard case .at . this bag is a steal !
does what it says it does . . . . . .looks great !it does just what it needs to do . it keeps my trailer from taking off down the road and wrecking everything in its path .this product is a must have for anyone driving . not only does it make it safer for highway driving . especially when occasionally rain drops are the beyond normal and make it difficult and unsafe to drive .one tip this product works well on highway driving during city however it does work but not as well . during highway driving you can actually see the rain peel away from your windshield . wooosh ! ! !
