does what it says it does . . . . . .looks great !it does just what it needs to do . it keeps my trailer from taking off down the road and wrecking everything in its path .this product is a must have for anyone driving . not only does it make it safer for highway driving . especially when occasionally rain drops are the beyond normal and make it difficult and unsafe to drive .one tip this product works well on highway driving during city however it does work but not as well . during highway driving you can actually see the rain peel away from your windshield . wooosh ! ! !
the container holds a . lb bag of science diet indoor cat chow with about inches to spare . the label says it hold lbs of cat chow but i do not see how that is possible . the wheels are nice and the seal is tight .both my dogs really love this treat . the small to medium size is good for both of my pound and pound dogs . my pound chihuahua mix has no trouble breaking it down into smaller pieces . it took them less than minutes to learn the word scooby . so now when i say scooby they get really excited cause know they re getting one of these .i noticed both of my dogs gained weight while on this . i found the weight gain to offset the health benefit so i stopped giving them this supplement .they have since returned to their normal weight . both dogs are small dogs a lb lhasa apso and a lb mutt . on the supplement both dogs gained lbs .
i needed a durable and handy flexible tire gauge for checking pressure on my motorcycles . this gauge is very well built and give accurate readings .this holds my grease guns quite securely but the angle of the handle you manipulate to get it to clamp and release the gun makes it awkward to use at times .great tool for clamping hard to reach radiator hose clamps . its multi position locking mechanism will make sure to clamp and hold various sized clamps unlike other pliers that can only hold in the fully close position .
works with a lot of mics and with a little modding it worked with my mxl v g which is all i needed it for .it does what is supposed to i ts a gate and clamps the noise as good as i expected at the begining i had problems with power some how it didn t power correctly but i was unsing one spot adapter and a daisy chain so i solved it isolating the mxr connecting it with another power supply and it work so i left my daisy chain with the rest of my pedals and it worked just fine also check config and the routing of the signal this might influence on how it works i have it right after my wha and before my compressor and it works just fine .this is a good quality cable and works just as i expected it to . i like the extra cable clips that came with it so i can keep it wrapped up untangled .
good price and qualitygreat pricethese are the gold standard for my daughter and i . very good quality worth the price . amazon has by far the best price even better than coupon or sales prices .
it all depends on your kids if these bottles work for you or not ? if the kids don t like them neither will youthey re exactly what they say they are they work they re well made . will continue to purchase when i need replacements .this thing works but it s very tricky getting off . if you work it a little you figure out how it will just pop off . don t get discouraged like i did . work it gently and it will come off easy with a little presure . does not fit a bulky box plug in head only standard ones like a lamp .
this is a great guitar cable its very long and does not get tangles up no matter how hard you try i recommend it to anybody who wants a good cable .one of the best stands in the industry ! fits any guitar banjo or even a cello . good construction and easy to put together .how can you beat that !this is the pick i learned to play with .great feel doesn t slip in sweaty fingers .good tone you can get plenty of use from one pick as they hold up very well !
this tascam us usb audio interface is exactly what i was looking for to record from our wireless mic with xlr outputs directly to my pc video editing software . we professionally produce instructional videos and needed this for voice over work on existing footage . before getting this convenient little unit we had to record into a camcorder and then import it into the pc so this saves us a step when we only need to record audio . here are my observations plug and play connected to my pc via usb and was instantly recognized usb powered no external power needed a big plus when using my laptop good sound clean and clear input multiple inputs xlr mic rca stereo line and hi z guitarmisc xlr input is not powered not a problem for us includes audacity software but we did not need to load ithighly recommended !cfhvery simple device to connect a quality dynamic microphone or instrument using a direct box to the usb input of a computer . i plugged in my mic and plugged the cable into my pc . win automatically searched for and found the drivers in about three minutes . i then recorded some vocals using audacity a free open source download . recording was whisper quiet with no background hiss or noise at all . recording level was great not sure why some reviewers said it was too low . note that this will not provide phantom power nor does the item description imply that it will . usb only provides vdc and phantom power usually requires vdc . unless there is some kind of power converter which would be much too large to fit in this compact package it is impossible for this or any similar sized cable to provide the higher voltage that phantom power requires . use this with a dynamic mic or direct box and if you use it correctly you will be very happy !i bought this as an interface between my mixer instruments and mics to my macbook for garageband . you have to go in and change the input and output in osx but it works great !
this is a great little filter . it pumps gallons per hour and has loads of filter media for a powerfilter of this size . don t be fooled by the inefficient filter cartridges used by other brands . this is the filter you want .the filter itself is working well . it is run by a very simple principle so much so that some people wonder how this simple sponges tubes and air bubbles actually filter water . however this system works for both mechanical filtration debris filtered and biological by beneficial bacterial living in the sponge .however because of the inverted l outflow tube it makes bubble noise . but you can take it off and the filter still sucks water through the sponges .if you want a simple filtration system this is a very good option . you might look into ati hydro sponge filters if you want a straight standing design sponge filter . i have used both elite sponge filters and hydro sponge filters . they are all working fine . hydro filters are fatter but standing on the bottom without suction cups . elite filters are placed on the aquarium wall . when you clean the tank glass hydro is easier . but if you want to utilize all the bottle space ex . for plants elite sponge would be more useful .this is a classic power filter that has been around for a long time . many competing brands of power filters have come and gone over the many years that this filter has been in production . and this one continues to sell today . this design has a lot going for it . it is inexpensive to purchase reliable easy to set up easy to clean and the replacement media are affordable .this filter is what is known as a hob hangs on the back of the aquarium power filter . the hang on the back power filter design usually cater to the casual aquarist . that is not to say that advanced aquarists do not use them . it is just that there are other filter designs that do a better job of mechanical chemical and biological filtration than the simple power filter . the main advantage to the power filter is the ease of set up . there are no hoses to cut and holes do not need to be drilled into the fish tank . a small motor driven impeller pulls water from the tank passes it through the filter media and then releases the water back into the tank . all this is done by sending the water over the top edge of the tank .i can recommend this aquaclear to someone with a freshwater tank of less than gallon capacity . it runs reliably and quietly . if you hear a lot of noise coming from the filter please remove the energizer motor and check the impeller . also make sure that the inlet tube is fully inserted on top of the impeller well . the mechanical filter is basically a coarse sponge . you can rinse this sponge out to remove excess debris and put it back in the filter . just be sure to rinse it out using dechlorinated water or waste water from the tank itself . unless this sponge becomes hopelessly clogged with debris possible if you have live plants you will not need to replace it . the ceramic rings that are included were designed to provide a place for beneficial bacteria to colonize and attach to . the carbon pack will need to be replaced . how often will depend on your tank s particular situation .a canister filter will usually provide superior mechanical and chemical filtration capabilities in comparison . however depending on the design maintenance will usually consume more of your time . wet dry filtration provides superior bio filtration but will usually be more expensive . the penguin marineland power filter brand with their bio wheel is said to be better at biological filtration than this and most other competing power filter design . it is priced competitively with the aquaclear . however with the penguin you will have to regularly buy their filter media . the aquaclear gives you more flexibility and more room in the filter box . i have used an emperor in the past on a large cichlid tank . the emperor which is similar in design to the penguins was made by marineland . very good design but again you will have to purchase their filter media on a regular basis . with the aquaclear you can buy your own filter bag buy carbon in bulk and save money over the life of the filter .why stars instead of ? the design allows for a lot of water by pass . power filters allow for some by pass to compensate for clogged filter pads . the aquaclears seem to allow more by pass than its competitors . also because of the coarse design of the mechanical filter sponge a lot of the smaller particles pass through . the prepackaged carbon bag fits snugly in the filter box of this filter perhaps packing the carbon granules tighter than they need to be . the water simply just flows around the bag and only makes contact with the carbon on the edges of the bag . i have also found that the carbon media is not very good at removing tannins from mopani wood from the water .this is a very inexpensive filter to maintain . i know a fellow hobbyist who does not use carbon . he just rinses the sponge during his water changes puts it back in and turns the filter back on . his only expense with this filter was the initial purchase price . i use carbon so there is a little bit of regular expense for me . but there are those who choose not to use carbon . some cichlid keepers blame carbon as a possible cause of hole in the head disease . i am not an expert and clearly the issues of carbon s relationship to this disease is beyond my qualifications to discuss . since i no longer keep cichlids i have continued to use carbon .
i already own amighty bright led book light with one lighting head but i bought this light as a semi permanent fixture on mydocument book holder which is mounted on anarticulating arm took a little diy ing .this music light has one drawback it doesn t have a master switch . to turn on both lights you would have to independently turn on the switch atop each light head two switch presses . to turn off both lights you would have to independently double click each light head four switch presses the first press brings the light to a lower level and the second press turns it off each light head has two light levels bright and medium bright for a total illumination combinations .i use this light for music sheets documents and books . the mighty bright label is no misnomer to be sure these lights are mighty bright . they provide more than enough illumination to make even smaller texts readable in low ambient light conditions . each light head provides very even illumination for a letter size sheet the light starts to get dimmer just beyond the fringes of the sheet so two light heads will provide sufficient illumination for a good sized area . it will simultaneously illuminate the verso and recto of even the largest books . the flexible goose necks of the music light allows you to easily position the lights to reduce glare which is inevitable on glossy or semi glossy pages .this music light is a mighty sweet deal because it comes with anac adapter which doesn t come with the book light with a single lighting head and has to be purchased separately . the adapter works on both this music light and the book light with a single lighting head . contrary to the product description this music light does come with aaa batteries at least mine did .important note if you switch from using batteries to using the ac adapter the aaa batteries will first have to be removed from the battery housing or the light s won t power on .i picked this music light over themighty bright orchestra lightbecause i ve had my single head book light for many years and i trust this book light to offer the same durability both lights are indistinguishable save for the single dual light heads two goose necks offer more lighting flexibility this music light is about half the price of the orchestra light . the bottom line the lack of a master switch on this music light makes turning on off the lights somewhat of a hassle an unfortunate but tolerable drawback . all the same this music light is very functional and as far as durability is concerned i m quite confident that it will last me for many years to come it has the same build quality as my mighty bright single head book light which i ve had for many years . recommended !these are great lights for music stands . if you need a good blackout light themighty bright pedalboard light blackhas a red light that works great for dark stages . because they are led the batteries last a long time . some of the mighty bright lights also have an ac adapter option but this one doesn t .this is a fairly compact must have accessory when working in pit or dim light situations . this music light will easily cover two pages of music and at a stretch three pages .the leds provide bright white even coverage making it possible to see the pages of music . the heads are easily adjusted with the flexible mounting arms and the two stage light intensity switch is a good feature when a lesser intensity light is desired .the small size of the light makes it perfect for travelling .

i had my vespa dealership recharge my piaggio bv battery after winter storage . they actually used this battery tender to charge it for me . however they only sold the deltran tender jr . amp . this charger has a faster charging time than the . amp . my batteries charge in about hours whereas the jr take about double that though exact timing obviously depends on how depleted your batteries are . i ve used this charger since then and it s been great . it s simple to use plug it in connect the clamps or leads to your battery and wait for the green light to light up indicating a full charge . there are two sets of connecting cables one is a clamp and the other a screw on which is good depending on your need . one benefit of these two cables is that they actually fit into each other and can be used to connect your battery to your bike while your battery is outside of your bike i had to use this feature because i accidentally shut my seat lock is battery powered when the battery was out and had to connect my battery remotely .if you have a vespa or other scooter i would highly recommend getting this charger . in cold weather scooter batteries die in about weeks of inactivity .i am very pleased with this battery maintainer . i purchased the cigarette light plug along with this unit and it is so easy to use . i plugged it in set it to normal charge and brought a totally discharged battery back to life . the battery is holding the charge just fine and i couldn t be happier . i especially like the supply mode on this unit so i can change out a battery without losing the codes on my car . no one should be without this charger . i have a car that sits in the garage and used sparingly and this device keeps the battery fully charged .i ve had good luck with this charger . i use it to charge a standard starter battery and two optima blue top deep cycle batteries on my aluminum bass boat . the charger has settings for standard agm and gel batteries as well as amp amp and amp charging rates . adjust the charging rate to the size of the battery being charged . charger also displays voltage of battery or percent of charge reading at your option . auto shut off and displays a green light when fully charged . all charging is done in my garage . the charger is stored there as well out of the elements . i ve had no problems in the two years i ve owned it . maintain your batteries during times of inactivity by charging at least monthly and they ll start your outboard when it s time to fish . a very good charger for the money spent .
this pedal is exactly what i have been looking for since three years ago when i started performing . the distortion on this is deep has long sustain and has a nice tone to it that the classic boss ds pedal does not have . it s perfect for a great sound from heavy rhythm guitar chugging to fat bruising solos .i love this pedal and have been using constantly ever since i got it .however word of fair warning the pedal itself uses a v power charge rather than the typical guitar f x pedal v barrel jack . look at the power supply of a boss pedal to see what i am talking about . this proco rat pedal does not use that . if you buy this pedal you will have to do one of four things buy the power supply made specifically for this pedal . consistently use and replace batteries . find a converter from barrel jack to . mm jack . be an electrical engineer and rewire it yourself .other than the above excellent pedal !i ve been using and abusing pedal effects since the s . . . . running all sorts of things through them chaining them in all sorts of configurations and have endured many wall wart pedal meltdowns over the years . i said all that b c i don t want to come off as condescending . i ve learned that the single most effective way to power pedals properly is to have an infinite number of v batteries or to be very careful to match pedal inputs with correct adaptor outputs . check the polarity of the tip is the tip positive or negative ? you ll fry a boss pedal in a flash if you plug a hot positive tip into one . make sure the polarity matches most pedals want negative tip adaptors except digitech which want plugs . make sure the voltage matches . a v adaptor into a v pedal won t power it . checking that these things are right will save you some and some of the behringer pedals i use about six of them on my board . . .see product links are polarity fragile and will break right away with the wrong adaptor . i fried a bbe delay the same way . happy effecting ! !behringer sm slow motion effects pedalbehringer dd guitar delay effect pedalbehringer cs compressor sustainer ultimate dynamics effects pedalbehringer adi v tone acousticbehringer pb preamplifier volume boosterbehringer ph classic phase shifterbehringer us ultra shifter harmonist ultimate pitch shifter harmonist effects pedalbbe two timer dual modedigitech dgr grunge analog distortion pedalelectro harmonix micro q tron envelope follower pedaljim dunlop m mxr m distortion digitech rp guitar multi effects processornice reverb pedal got rid of my boss reverb . the tc pedals are all that is on byboard except my wah and a phase if they made these pedals i d probablybe all tc electronics ! what else can i say ! ! ! !
made in china poor quality item that does not befit the robert bosch brand at all .not for winter for sure .the origin of the product should be stated at the product page .if i knew it were a made in china i would not have bought it .valterra is known for quality rv products and accessories this is no exception . shipping was on time and product was exactly what i was expecting .very cheaply made product . it works but could be made with better quality product . probably wouldn t buy this product again
these pens are similar in appearance and quality to the pens i used when i was a kid years ago . they perform much better than the cheaper pens that are everywhere today . i didn t give them stars because they do occasionally have a glitch and are not perfect .i use amazon for most of my purchases and update my reviews if anything changes with the products . i do this so other amazon users can get a real feel for the life of the product . you can look at my review which will be close to my purchase date and tell how the product is doing as time passes . i am not associated with any company and all opinions are my very own .any thing you use this for excellent choice i bought them to child proof my house drawers . incredibly strong ! buy it i will buy more for may other purposes !indeed as another reviewer has stated these pens have been around for almost ever . there of course is a reason for this . . .actually several reasons . first they are quite inexpensive . second they actually write . third they are available anywhere . forth they do no leak . they last quite a long time . and finally they are not unpleasant to write with .i substitute teach which means i can be in a rd grade class one day and in an advanced high school class the next . . .i never know . i carry a very large canvas pouch with me stuffed with stuff . i always carry at least two or three packs of these pens with me as invariably sure as the sun rises there will be at least one or two kids who forgot their pen or pencil i always keep several packages of pencils too . . .but that is for another review . i have also noted that some classes and some students will actually try to take advantage of a substitute teacher and their third favorite request the instant the bell rings is can i go to my locker . . .i forgot my pen . ha . . .i have the little twerps ! and i don t even have to be mean about it like i do with the endless bathroom and drink requests .anyway these pens work great . they do not leak all over the place and smudge . if the student forgets to return the pen . . .which often happens i am not out a lot of money and they are less likely to steal them as they do not really look all that cool nor do they have a lot of whistles and bells on them .as an additional advantage i do not mind writing short notes with them myself and i am one of those people who are constantly misplacing pens all over the house and at my desk . i have found that even i have trouble loosing these things if i buy them a dozen at a time . anyway they write smoothly and get the job done .like another reviewer here i am not all that happy about these not being manufactured in this country anymore and think it is a shame . . .but what are you going to do ? i guess it is worth it if we can make the fat cats fatter . i will note that when the company changed the manufacturing location to save money i presume i certainly did not see the price of these things cheap though they may be going down any for us the consumer .be that as it may i certainly can recommend these things . they do what they were meant to do .don blankenshipthe ozarks
i just didn t care for this at all . the head part was not high enough for me i am a two pillow sleeper . the curve drove me batty because this pillow did not eliminate the need to toss and turn just made it harder . couldn t figure out the belly support feature just didn t help me . doesn t come with a case which is and all in all i think just knowing i am sleeping on a pillow makes me uncomfortable ! i returned it the next day just not worth it . i ll stick with my pillow arsenal it s not ideal but it s free and works just as well as this .does it work ?i received this as a very thoughtul gift at around months in my pregnancy i do have to admit that probably would not spend this much on myself at months i didn t really need it at months or around there once you are told that you should not be sleeping on your back i tried it out . i didn t like it at first but as your tummy grows and you get increasingly more uncomfortable this pillow helped with lower back discomort and to support a growing belly . i m about there was more then enough real estate to give me support where needed . it bends easily which is a big plus . it also didn t take most of our bed as i thought it would . overall once you get used to it yes it will help you sleep betteris it worth the price ?that s up to you to decide . all i can say is that with the nd baby and as i got older comfort was very important but that s a personal take . .what about quality ?as other reviewers mentioned the cover is made out of a very cheap cotton like fabric it is scratchy and not soft at all . my work around instead of buying a more expensive nd cover which is really what they want you to do i put my own pillow case over the top head part of the pillow and wrapped it the best i could . . it s not ideal but it s free and i get to sleep on a nicer fabric it really doesn t matter for the bottom as much . .your legs won t know the differenceoverall ? i would recommend it for comfort if you can t afford the price tag start with a wedge and something for between your legs should be sufficient if you don t have lower back problems .i tried this a few nights before it got ole heave ho ! it did not help me at all . i was better off with the regular pillow between my legs . i don t know why it didn t work for me but it didn t . it was uncomfortable and hard to roll from side to side with . and it takes up so much space . . . . don t recommend this at all . . . especially for the price .
this is one of those products that most households should keep on hand stuck in that miscellaneous stuff drawer along with string packing tape and whatnot .it s mainly good for the purposes scotch mentions sticking things up on walls . the inch thickness of foam allows for irregularities between your wall and what you re sticking up if you try to use regular non foamdouble sided tapefor anything more substantial than a sheet of paper you re inviting anengineering disaster .this mounting tape can be considered reasonably permanent anything that doesn t fall down in the first few hours will probably never fall down . but at the same time it s semi removable if you ever have to take down whatever you ve stuck up with this stuff you can usually do so with little or no damage to the object or the wall . if the wall is painted removing the tape will most likely take off the paint in that area too . but for surfaces like tile plastic or enamel i .e . refrigerators a layer of the tape will stay behind and this can be removed with paint thinner or something likegoo gone along with a fair amount of elbow grease .in short it s good stuff to have around .my home office floor is carpeted so rolling my desk chair is a bit tough . this mat really helps a lot but over time a depression has developed in the middle where the chair sits most of the time . i will say this mat is far superior to a plastic mat on carpet however since those develop depressions under each chair castor making it hard to get the chair moving . this mat doesn t have that problem but isn t as stiff as i wish it were . considering it is a roll up mat it is very sturdy though and is the best solution i ve found for moving my chair with ease over the carpet . after two years of regular use it is a bit scuffed up but still looks good and still does the job .this large size is good if you need to move around to filing cabinets and printers . the projection in front keeps the chair from rolling off the mat when it is pushed up close to the desk . that s important because when the chair is partly rolled off the mat it s not easy to get it back on if the chair is heavy and you can t do it at all while you re seated . the step up onto the mat when it s on carpet is almost half an inch . the mat is not that thick but the pile of the carpet and the roll up structure of the mat tends to raise the edges a bit .i recommend the mat highly for use on a hard floor surface that one is trying to protect and with reservations for use on padded carpet . in that setting it isn t perfect but better than the alternatives i ve tried so far .papers that were filed on the floor are now off the floor and on the shelves wondabar ! ! ! i love it .
you really have to play around with all the knobs to find the perfect tone i was able to sort of dial in a nice marshall s alt rock sound but when you re not playing it can have a noisy wind like feedback coming from your amp but it can vary from amp to amp . you can fiddle with the voice and drive knobs to clear it up but that usually results in a drop in your overdrive or distorted sound . but to be perfectly honest it s pretty impressive the sound you get out of this for less than .this is an amazing amp . it works great a lot of power a little bit heavy for it s size but it is simply a beauty . i play a godin a ultra and the the sound of this amp is so clean that i can play my acoustic and my electric trough this amp and both sounds perfect . even the acoustic sound is majestic . this amp adapts to any need you have from the cleanest sound to the heaviest distorted sound .i have only used one of these with a hybrid tube amp and a solid state but i hear that it will work with either tube or solid state amplifiers . it really gives my amplifier a warm overdriven sound . this pedal can be used to boost your guitar sound during solos or certain guitar parts . this pedal has three preamp settings ts hot and turbo . it s great for solos and warm blues or rock rhythm guitar . one nice thing about this is it responds well to how soft or hard you pluck the strings . for example if you set on the turbo setting and pick with your fingers it will clean up nicely . if you pluck hard it will make a smooth distorted sound . if you want a metal sound then i recommend the metal zone by boss roland .boss mt metal zone overdrive distortion pedal
does not work at all not work at alldoes not work at all cant tell u what the problem is i mean its a friggen stapler and i thought paying more money would guarentee something that worked now i will have to use the one my mom swiped from work it works plus has her name written on it so i will have to watch my ps and qs .used these at a job i use to work at . got some for my business as i travel . works great !i had these at work these are the pens i prefer to use . i like it that is a click stick .
this is a high quality bulletin board with a darker brown cork board instead of the regular brighter cork . it is very sturdy and weighs about lbs . the frame is graphite in color . the top and bottom frames seem to be made of mdf and the side frames are plastic . the cork seems to be high density but rather thin . it holds pin very well and doesn t show holes much after removing the pins . overall it s a sturdy and blends with decor very well due to its darker cork color .it comes with metal brackets screws and anchors for mounting . you have to drill holes in the wall to mount it . it seems a bit overkill for a lb bulletin board . anyway i had to read the instructions a few times in order to understand exactly how to mount it perfectly horizontal . the top and bottom frames have groove in them for the brackets to hook on . once mounted correctly it s very stable and flush with the wall . one thing to note is that the board is not designed to be mounted vertically since the plastic side frames lack the groove that the brackets hook on to . it also comes with quick clips which are basically plastic sheets that you slide into the frame and holds photos or papers without using pins .overall this is a high quality professionally looking bulletin board with a darker cork color that blends well with home and office decor . the cork remains looking good after repeated pinning and unpinning . i knocked a star off the rating because the cork seems to be very thin only time can tell how long it can last and of the fact that it requires drilling so many holes in the wall to mount it . besides that i m happy with the look and the performance so far .i love office supplies and anything that gets those lose papers off of my tables and counters . this corkboard is a perfect solution for items that i want to save but don t want to deal with right away .my last corkboard was actually made of cork whereas this high density cork fiberboard seems to be some time of manufactured cork that doesn t show pin holes . time will tell how well it holds up .this also came with two little plastic pieces called quick clips which slide into the frame and can hold papers . the most interesting thing about this corkboard was the fastening brackets .it comes with four large screws anchors and brackets . i had to read the directions twice before the measuring instructions sunk in . you can use the top and bottom edges of the board to create a line . then align the line on the bracket with the lines on the wall and make a circle or mark where you want to drill .then drill the anchor holes attach the brackets and snap in the board . it actually worked . attach the bottom brackets first before measuring and attaching the top brackets . if you follow the instructions this board will be flush with the wall and very stable . this is a nice product .scotch inch mounting tape is a padded double sided tape on a inch roll . one side gets applied to an object and the other side gets pressed against a surface on which you wish to mount your object . the cushion between the adhesive layers gives you flexibility when it comes to mounting objects that do not lie flat against one another .this mounting tape is designed to be permanent and is not repositionable . the user must take care to line up objects carefully when mounting them and there is no guarantee that the surface of your walls will be completely immune to damage when this is removed . for some items it might be helpful to mark its desired position before mounting or use a small level .for some items mounting tape is an ideal solution . for example one of my children made an art project on a square inch ceramic tile . there was no way to nail it to a wall and adhesive hangers with flaps for mounting on picture hooks don t always hold up to the task . due to the irregular surface on the back of ceramic tiles the foam padding is needed to provide the thickness and to allow for irregularities in the surface .as a rule you should use about a half inch of this tape per ounce of weight . i used . inches for the ceramic tile and the bond is as strong as would ever be needed . the package says that it holds up to lbs which presumably refers to the maximum weight of each object to be mounted . the roll is long enough to support a total of over nine pounds worth of items . sixty by photographs weigh about nine ounces so this roll can go a long way .the tape itself comes in a roll with no dispenser and with a single backing strip between layers . therefore you can t pre cut a section and hold onto it for later . but you can cut off the amount you need apply it to an object and leave the backing layer in place until you are ready to mount your object .there s nothing new or innovative about this product but this product is very well suited to its task . it can also be used for a wider variety of tasks but it might be best to save it for those special tasks for which it outshines other solutions . although it can replace anything from thumbtacks to picture hooks thumbtacks are cheaper and this product might be overkill . as double sided padded adhesive tapes go this one does the job as well as can be expected .
i love wellness brand pet foods and treats . my cat was pretty picky and getting sick on other brands of food . i was glad to see that this cat food is free of artificial ingredients as well as grain free . she gets fed a bit of this canned food combined with a small amount of wellness dry cat food daily . she was overweight before starting this food and now looks to be a healthy normal weight . i would definitely recommend this food to other cat owners !wellness makes such great products and i have been feeding this canned food with core weight management dry food and my senior dogs love it and it is so good for them .we switched our cat to a part kibble part wet food diet and she really loves this wet food ! turkey and salmon is a perfect and healthy balance for my kitty !
works great nice to have a second cable but the obd end of the cable is angled . in my case this cable won t work on my subaru outback . i would prefer the option of a straight obd connector . note that the angle connector works on my other four cars mazda honda dodge .i cut the horn off the compressor . the horn will fit under the stock cowbell . the compressor was attached under the right side panel to the frame with large zip ties . i ran some hose from home depot to the cowbell and connected it to the stock horn wire . the horn sound goes right between the cylinders and is loud as h ll . many of cell phone scum bags will tell you that my set up works real good .fits my john deere lawn tractor which is model la and likely it fits all the l la and d series lower end john deere tractors . please post a comment if it does not and i ll update this reviewcurrently amazon says it does not fit my third generation miata nc but it doesthese filters come top in most online filter tests and i use them in almost all my cars
used this with gallon of distilled water fill up the rest of my car with mix wow my car runs cool now ! it use to overheat on hot summer days with a c on now the temp gauge actually goes down from time to time ! love it will use every summer !i used to hold the ez pass up each time we hit a toll . this is great since we don t use the tolls on a daily basis . you can take the ez pass down with no sign it was there . suction cups are strong . we ve used it in all weather . hot summers cold winters and rainy days are no problem . great gift or stocking stuffer . too bad it can t alleviate ny traffic !i have lawn mowers for summer and a snow blower for winter . i have used sta bil for years in the gas can which i use for these machines for over years . the lawn mower sits around for months with gas in it over the winter . using sta bil prevents the gum and varnish residue that can be left behind when gasoline evaporates . no need to drain the mowers or blowers every season . the engines usually start right up after having been left idle for months . sta bil has worked me and i will continue to use it .
even though it is fender it was made in china i would have thought the us . what can you say about a guitar chord ?works perfectly for both my martin dreadnought and my fender stratocaster . solid unit good material and construction though it is made in china apparently but hey thats why its such a bargain !hi i thought these pots would come without the proper caps it s not on the description of the product and they did so i m pleased by it have not installed them yet . . . they are cts brand it s hard to read what uf are the caps i think they are . uf the standard for fender guitars
i ordered the wrong ones so just make sure you order the correct ones otherwise these would have been perfect .ok i guess i should have figured it out but i didn t think too hard about it . . .i wanted an extra set of complete shields the product description mentions keeping an extra set at work so my brain assumed this was a set of shields . nope it s one shield assembly . thank goodness for amazon prime so i get free shipping doesn t matter too much to me that i need to order another one it will get here in days with prime . but buyer beware . . .this is just the listing for one shield .also . . .i found out when i tried to use them after i ordered a second one . . .this does not come with the little connecter that attaches the tubes to the shield so if you need an extra set of everything this won t help you .replacement for my medela pump . after so much use these little things crack and break . perfect that i can just buy these little membranes and not the entire end .
you can never go wrong buying a kyser capo . they are made to last and really do what they are designed to do . the great thing about this capo is that it fits both my banjo and mandolin so i don t have to have a seperate capo for each .i also have a capo for guitar made by kyser and i can tell you that works just as well . you can never go wrong with a kyser . not only that i like the idea that it s an us company . i ve had some cheaper capos and they just don t do the job . they either don t press down on the strings hard enough or they wear out too quickly if they get used much . this kyser will last a long long time .i ve only used the string winder so far but it works well so far . i use it on my guitars and my banjo . the other things look like they will work well but i haven t used them yet so i can t say for sure . if not then i ll update this review if i can .i wan t sure i would like this thing when i ordered it but it was cheap enough to try . i don t like using it as much as i thought i would but that s just me . the device works as advertised . over a long period of use i think it might leave a mark on the sound hole even though the hook is padded .
this stand easily supports my poundfender frontman r watt x inch guitar combo ampat any height setting . in fact even extended to the highest the this stand supports that amp with no issues from the center of gravity or weight distribution of the amplifier .i love the ease of setting up and breaking down this stand . it is essentially three parts the base and two removable arms . granted that this is heavy but the added weight is there because this thing is built like a tank .in addition to being rock solid the parts mate perfectly with no slop in tolerances . the support arms slide into the base with no friction or excess movement and the height adjustment has three nicely spaced positions . you merely pull back on the spring loaded knobs to release the safety pins that engage the arms for position . once you line up the holes release the knobs and the pins solidly engage and hold the amp in place .my only complaint and it is more of a wish is the tilt of the stand is at a fixed angle . i would love it if i could adjust that too but i am sure that it would drive up the price of the stand . one final note these significantly increase the footprint of an amp on stage . specifically it increases the depth dimension by nearly of my frontman r although the difference in length is nominal . i mention this so you can factor that in if you normally play small venues with cramped stages .overall this is an excellent stand and one that is stable and heavy duty . at the current price at the time of this review it s a bargain .i have mine attached to one of the support arms on myon stage ks xx pro double x keyboard stand . while this attachment is designed for both square and round tube supports i was unable to use it with anon stage tier folding z keyboard standeven with the top tier removed . the reasons for the problem with the latter stand is the friction fitting on the attachment bar was too small for the oblong support tube and had it mated the height of the attachment bar would not have cleared the top of the keyboard .when attached to theon stage ks xx pro double x keyboard standwith anon stage msa tb adjustable microphone boom blackattached to the top screw in post that perfectly mates with the boom this attachment bar boom combination easily clears the height of either keyboard i use aroland rd nx digital stage pianoor aroland v combo key stage keyboard .bottom line make sure your stand can accommodate this attachment bar according to the manufacturer it will work with most x style stands and carefully measure the height of the top of your keyboard from the center of the support arm to which this attachment bar will be inserted . the total height of the attachment bar after insertion is approximately . . if your keyboard is still too high for the attachment bar boom or other mic holder to clear you can gain an additional with ashure a x mic mount extension tube .this little music stand folds up small enough after some disassembly to fit in a pouch less than feet tall and inches wide . once assembled it stands straight and is more than sturdy enough for sheet music or most softbound books . the height is adjustable so you should be able to find a comfortable position whether you re standing seated on a stool or in a chair . the angle of the tray is not adjustable . the legs are simple flat metal pieces and could be susceptible to being bent if you trip over it so this might not be the best stand if you plan to keep it in one location . but for a portable stand it s hard to find fault with this one especially given the low cost .
i purchased this net when it was cents which was a great buy and you shouldn t pay more for it especially when there are many other costs for a fish . this net is definitely not worth . i have an almost full grown male betta in a gallon bowl and was using a inch fish net which was very small and difficult to catch him with so i upgraded to this three inch net and it is the perfect size much easier to catch him with . the net is extremely basic nice long handle and sturdy . it is definitely not of the highest quality such as the quality of aquarius aq aquarium fish net but there is no reason for it to be it isn t necessary the net does its job .i will say however that the mesh is tightly woven but it is not very forgiving to bettas delicate fins so be careful . compared to my inch net it is much coarser .works great but is on the small side as in not a large diameter gauge would be easier to read if it was bigger .this perch is bendable so your bird doesn t have yet another straight perch . the cage is inches wide so we got the inch perch to put a double bend in it . our amazon parrot loves it !
this pedal is a must have for any pedal board . i love the overdriven sound of this pedal in that it has a distortion element but not so distorted single notes are lost in the fray . thirty some odd years and counting and still one of the best .this is my favorite pedal . . .and i have a ton . lots of high end pedal and this a cheap only in price pedal ! great bluesy tones . . . .sweet and warm when the drive is down . . .mean and nasty when the drive is cranked up . like a cranked tube amp . if you play the blues . . .this is your pedal . i m sold . i ve purchased several joyo pedals and all of them are built extremely well and perform as good as if not better than top name pedals .as far as tried and true distortion pedals go this is really just average . the filter doesnt have enough of an impact on the pedal to provide a truly large range from fuzz to metal distortion . compared to other distortion pedals it really fails in this regard . however if used as a fuzz pedal instead it truly shines since this is really what it is . does it have distortion ? yes . is it valuable as such ? not in my opinion . it isnt condensed enough to be used strictly as that . another gripe i have is the volt slot . most pedals use a universal design which allows you to use almost any power supply . not so with this pedal . you are pretty much relegated to their own adapter or batteries which sux imo especially since i run all my pedals off an adapter chain .anyways while this is fun to play with you should definitely consider the sound you are going for . if you prefer to play a more grungy or s era metal then this will work for you . for more crisp sound you should look elsewhere . imo
i bought this after many people suggested it for the sole purpose of gas exchange in my saltwater tank after a power outage . granted i have no open outlets for this to actually work as intended the pump is off when plugged into a live outlet and only turns on when ac power is lost but manually turning this on during the last power outage worked like a charm . cheap reliable safety item imo .this is perfect for a backup system for your aquarium . plug it into an outlet put batteries in and then it will turn on automatically when the power is out to that outlet . i plugged mine into the same power strip my filter runs off of so if the filter stops the bubbles will start and save the fish .runs a bit loud but that s to be expected from an emergency backup system . i actually like that it makes noise so you can be alerted that it s running right away so you know something wrong with the power to the tank .takes d batteries but can run on a single battery . i didn t notice a change in output with one vs . two batteries so i m guessing one battery just runs out quicker than with two .as an included bonus you can use this air pump to aid in transporting fish long distances .this did not work at all on my small dogs . after i installed it right near their favorite window to bark at they stopped barking until it stopped making the noise but after repeating this a couple times they became immune to the noise and ignore it completely . besides not working the other thing i did not like about this was the power cord . my fault for not reading the description close enough but i figured a product like this would probably be battery operated but it only runs using a power cord to an electrical outlet .
when you first get this body pillow it will be extra firm . you have to massage it and work the pillow to loose that firmness . i ended up having to take the cover off the pillow to help loosen it up . they have it packed so tight inside . used that case as a template to sew a new one with a little more room . best thing for pregnancy .i purchased this item over the boppy pillow because of the velcro seat wrap . it keeps my baby in place without him sliding downwards which i have witnessed with other babies using the boppy pillow . boppy pillow covers can used with this leachco pillow . when my baby is too big for the velcro seat wrap i will be using boppy pillow covers on this pillow . the lack of the removable cover is a disadvantage for cleaning purposes .when i first bought snoogle i loved it as it was perfectly supportive as promised . then my toddler barfed in our bed and some of it unfortunately splashed on snoogle . snoogle s cover had to be washed . snoogle s cover is very snug without a hint of stretch . snoogle s one cover opening is in a very awkward location . i was so frustrated with trying to put snoogle s cover back on after washing that i left it off and left the pillow bare . big mistake . snoogle s supportive secret is in its cover because when left without it s basically a flat blob of cheap batting that stores body heat like an extra lumpy camel and then spits it back at you during the night . why do people devise ways to frustrate pregnant women ? finally today i put snoogle s cover back on and after a half hour of twisting writhing cursing and taking two breaks . . . i got the stupid cover back on but didn t even have a post coital glow as an added benefit .my recommendation ? buy a straight but fairly flexible body pillow . it s what i had for my first pregnancy . we simply used two king cases to cover it and i had no problem curving it to fit between my knees as needed .
plain all white labels easily peel off the main sheet of labels each and onto wherever you want labeled .if you use them for name badges you can remove the badge label with the backing attached by turning the sheet over easy ! so you can organize lay out individual name badges labels .warning each sheet recommends not to apply to leather suede velvet corduroy silk vinyl or plastic .so keep this in mind if you re using for name tags . not every participant will be wearing cotton . i did try them on paper they ll remove some of the paper on fleece they ll remove some fleece fuzz and on vinyl the label lifted right off .they are sturdy and i appreciate they are not pre printed so that i can type print or design .i used these magnet sheets to make my own custom fridge poetry . the sheets easily went through my laser printer and everything printed correctly . cutting the sheets using a paper cutter and scissors was equally easy . now i have custom fridge poetry .for my goals this product was perfect .the avery labels have been around forever but these have been improved . easier to pull off the backing sheet particularly the first label of the sheet .
my portable phone finally went haywire so i decided to buy this corded phone since i don t really need a portable and all the static that comes with it . this at t phone is a basic design feels sturdy and works very well with clear sound . no static no distortion no sounding like people are in the distance or speaking from a straw or whatever it sounds just like the good old solid phones we used to have before all the portable junk started spreading all over the place . i accidentally dropped it when answering a call and it came out unscathed . if you want a solid basic phone without bells and whistles buy this one . actually it does have the ability to program thirteen numbers a feature i used successfully so it does have some bells and whistles .a very user friendly fax machine . no bells and whistles . works like a charm every time . i highly recommend for a cheap fax .this is a basic mouse pad . it has no bells and whistles . it functions perfectly and i would buy it again .
any guitarist knows how one of these works . clamp it on the head turn it on and tune . i ve tried this on several guitars as well as an electric bass . my only real complaint is that it often takes seconds to register the note it s getting . it occasionally latches onto a harmonic as well . the low e on my bass will occasionally register as a b rd harmonic for example . in general the dullest means of plucking the string finger instead of pick will give the quickest and most glitch free pitch . all in all it s a handy little tool to have in the gig bag .i ordered the hola ! and the snark sn to preview for my senior adult ukulele players at church . i ve spent the last week or so tuning a large group of or so ukuleles twice a day to allow them to settle in . i ve used both of these similarly priced tuners and have found them both to be excellent . i can t really tell any difference in the accuracy of either one . they are both contact tuners meaning that they pick up the vibration of the instrument rather than relying on an external microphone .the hola ! is definitely the best choice of the two in that it s more versatile easier to use more durable looking and easier to store . the hola ! lies virtually flat and takes up less space in every dimension than the snark . it comes in a plastic sales container that can be reused to offer further protection if you feel the need . the snark s curved display arm which you can t really see in the photo is slightly more delicate looking in addition to the fact that it extrudes farther . i found the hola ! display to be bigger brighter and generally easier to read . honestly most of these differences are minor especially when considering how inexpensive these tuners are . the really important difference is the tuning mode feature on the hola ! .hola ! offers very simple operation with one button for power and for switching between its modes of function . you can select chromatic guitar bass and ukulele modes by briefly pressing the power button as opposed to a long press for power on off . this is an especially important feature if the user is not an experienced and knowledgeable musician . imagine trying to tune with a an key piano if you don t know anything about the notes on the piano . ukulele mode is like using a piano with only notes . use chromatic to tune your uke differently than standard or tune other instruments .the snark is superior in it s rotating display which can be turned and rotated in almost any direction . if turning your head at all is a deal breaker get the snark . i found the hola ! s display to be more than sufficient . i m currently using the snark on my guitar .this will work with my daughter s ipod touch generation . however the garage band app is for ios and hers is an ios . and will not update to . so though she can t use garage band there are others that are supposed to work . she downloaded the ampkit app and it works great with her ipod and the apogee jam .here is a list of other apps that are supposed to work with the apogee jam ampkitamplitube version . or greater amps cabsanytuneapple garagebandaudio deck professionalbias iprorecordereveryday looperfairlight samplerfantastocrats studiominigibson s l m hindenburg field recorderianalyzerimovieirecorder proishred livejamuploopymcdsp retro recordermultitrack dawnano studio trg pad sampling pocketamppocketgkreap dfxriot fxrock prodigy guitarscratchtonessonoma fourtracksonoma guitartonestudio devil guitar amptaylor eqvocalive version . or greater voice memosxewton music studio . it s a pretty cool idea but the cords are a nuisance . most electric guitar players like to stand while playing and the cords need some managing to keep them out of the way and not have them pull out of their connections . i was surprised at how small the jam is . . . . .slightly bigger than a bic cigarette lighter . using this is much more convenient than lugging an amp around and it saves on other s ears and nerves if they can only hear the acoustic playing of the guitar strings especially if you are beginner guitarist !overall pretty good and very simple to operate . just make sure you have a full charge on the device of your choice . my daughter also used it to record her playing and said that was easy to do .
i got this when i was just learning how to play guitar . i was using a borrowed first act guitar without any amp and i wanted to see what kind of sounds i could make . it was inexpensive and fun to use . the sound quality isn t the greatest but that s to be expected . you can dial in quite a few different sounds and it comes with a sheet showing you how to make different sounds . it s very light so make sure you set it on the floor because you will be pulling it over with the guitar cable . i pulled it off the table a couple of times with no ill effects but i wouldn t want to take any chances .i m used to the old s and s speakers that i ve had on my stereo since that time . i read the reviews about what people said about hearing things they never had before . i was blown away . they are all correct get them setup right and hear all the things your music has been missing i listen all the time with different headphones not the same ! . the way the music was separated so well i swear it sounded like the vocals were coming from right in front of me and the guitars were on each side of the vocals . i had to dig up all kinds of music to test them out . i don t know what kind of bass people are wanting out of these but when i use them to watch movies listen to music etc . . . they have lots of punch even when i play my guitar through them pod hd pro .i write and record my own music . i stink at writing drums . i don t play drums i don t really have room for a drumset and i really don t want to spend the money on a drumset to see if i can figure it out . this is a great program for non drumming one man bands like me . midi drums and the drum sounds from my yamaha keyboard just wasn t cutting it . it works with ableton live with no problems . tons of different grooves . it sounds like a real drummer on a real drumset . very easy to use .
my dogs weren t impressed . the size was good for a large breed and i bet if your dog is a chewer he she would love this bone . like this dog bone but a bit too small for a very large dog i recommend the largest size if you have big dogs or heavy chewing dogs .i didn t think my great dane or hound mix would like a bone made of nylon but surprisingly they both enjoy it . it is is a good size for the hound pounds but the dane could use something bigger unfortunately i think this is the biggest size .
the plastic is thick enough not to flex or twist and the shape of the end is good as it sits on the tailgate . very stable . . . . my cat seems to tolerate it and it collects the loose hair .nice and slick so that it does not tug but easy enough to cleanpretty good stone . lots of bubbles . does the job fairly well . bubbles could be finer and distributed more evenly over the length of the stone but playing around with the installation angle helps compensate for uneven distribution .
this holds a fairly large bag of dog food enough for two pugs for one month . it fits into a narrow cabinet . very convenient .item as described . easy to set up and fold back up when you want out of the way . gate is very easy to open and close . has been a great pen for my puppy . it is on tile and she can push the panels and change the shape a bit if she wants but not enough that it is an issue or of concern . she is lbs and there is still plenty of room for her bed water dish and for her to play a bit with the toys we leave in there for her . not really big enough for her to get exercise but a great puppy dog playpen .i bought this cage because of the price at first because a lot of the other cage this size are way too expensive . i had some initial concerns with this cage . i thought that the top play perch looked cheap at first but it is actually really nice because unlike the other play top cages that have a whole separate play gym at the top this one is very easy to open close and it does not require a lot of cleaning like the full play gym tops do . plus when open it allows my bird to go in and out of the cage very easily and play with every thing in her cage . with the cages that have the full play gym tops the bird is either in or out of the cage . the stand to this cage and the shelf on the bottom are amazing ! it is very sturdy and is easily rolled around . the bottom tray slides out easily and the extra storage on the bottom is super awesome . the food bowls have little doors that can be opened from the outside and on the cage i got both were one one side of the cage rather than one on either side like in the picture .
the matte paper is ok but i would purchase glossy paper for a sharper imageavery sticker project paper sheetsthese sheets fed without problems in my inkjet printers but the sticker sheets are not glossy and feel homemade when you print documents . with a laser printer the images will look better . the adhesive isn t the strongest as my stickers had trouble sticking onto curved metallic surfaces but they are reusable to a certain extent . i d recommend using something to cover the image like a transparent laminated sheet to protect it from fluids or wear tear .overall stars the paper media could have been glossy to give a higher quality feel . the adhesive isn t very strong .it s been a while since i ve used actual greeting card paper to make my photo greeting cards . the first time i made greeting cards on a pc i used hp greeting card paper which i found on clearance . i loved making photo cards ! unfortunately i realized greeting card paper was a bit costly when not on clearance so i turned to other paper for my cards . mostly i have made them oncanon matte photo paper . x inches sheets a . note however i have not bought this paper since when i stocked up on it because it was so cheap . thus i don t know if canon has changed anything about the paper or not . the box itself looks different . it is basically inexpensive photo paper and has no canon name on the reverse side so you can print your greetings on that side . just make certain you print the photo on the right side . if not it will look horrendous whereas words look just fine . hold the paper up to a lamp to find the brightest white side for the photo . it also folds relatively easily . if you want your card on glossy paper use glossy photo paper for your photograph pastel or bright bonded paper for your message and tape or paste the bonded paper to the back of the glossy paper . all glossy paper i have ever seen has the brand s name on the back so messages can t be printed there . then just get a box of envelopes that fit your cards such ascolumbian co grip seal invitation envelopes a x white box of .if you want it quick and easy though do get these avery greeting cards . the envelopes are included and the card paper is already half folded so there s no struggle in getting the card folded just right . the photos i printed on these cards looked almost as good as the photos printed on matte photo paper . i used of these avery cards to make a stationery set for friends . i printed photos of their dogs on the front of the cards and left the insides blank for newsy notes . since the envelopes in this pack come bounded in two sets of ten that worked out quite well . i included one of the envelope sets with the cards and had a very nice christmas gift for my friends . i don t think the included envelopes are quite as nice as the columbian ones but they certainly will do . also when making a quarter card while folding the half card in half the card tore in half ! so you might want to watch out for that or get quarter card paper for your smaller cards . making greeting cards on the computer is lots of fun and avery makes it simple with these half fold greeting cards !
having our grandson move closer meant i needed to purchase some necessary equipment and a potty seat is definitely necessary . however the toilets in our home have elongated seats and many of the potty seats i looked at were made for standard toilet seats . after reading numerous amazon reviews i decided to purchase the babybj ouml rn toilet trainer and am very pleased with my choice .the babybj ouml rn toilet trainer sits on the seat and is then secured by turning a wheel at the back of the seat . this moves two wings so that the seat attaches securely to the toilet seat even if it is an elongated seat . after securing the seat i tried to wiggle the babybj ouml rn toilet trainer from side to side as might happen with a rambunctious toddler . the seat held firmly in place .the splash guard at the front of the seat is sufficiently high to prevent accidental oversprays . further it is curved so that liquids do not hit it and splash out the sides they flow down into the toilet as they should . the solid piece construction of the main seat prevents waste products from becoming trapped in grooves or joints and minimizes the possibility of odor .further the seat rinses off easily and can then be hung by the large attached loop to dripdry . i hung a light s shaped hook over the towelbar on the back wall of the bathtub and use it to hold the babybj ouml rn toilet trainer after it has been rinsed .if you are looking for a quality potty seat which will fit both standard and elongated toilet seats you should definitely consider the babybj ouml rn toilet trainer . it is a five star necessity !i bought babybj ouml rn toilet trainer to potty train my son . he likes using it and the splash guard in the front works . there is an adjustment wheel located at the back of the seat by the handle to adjust the toile trainer to the size of the regular toilet seat . we have elongated kohler toilets and the babybj ouml rn toilet trainer adjust to fit snugly .the reason i am rating it stars is the adjustment wheel started slipping after a few removal and reinstallations . now if i have to reinstall the seat i pre adjust it and then position it onto the regular toilet seat .we have a standard size and shape toilet seat . yet this potty seat fits the seat in an awkward manner causing pee to leak both on top and under the front of the toilet seat . granted i have little boys so maybe this isn t so much of a problem with girls .we had much better luck with the mommy s helper cushie tushie potty seat the one with the ducks on it which is incidentally much cheaper and easier to clean . the same unfortunate pee situation never happens with that seat .
this is definitely a must have for the home recording enthusiast especially if you are using any of the xenyx or other behringer brand mixers it also works with other mixers as well .this is a great inexpensive way to get your analog audio into your digital recording software . it works on windows mac and linux at least it did for me .this mxl studio usb microphone is a decent choice for those needing a portable or a good quality studio microphone . we professionally produce instructional videos both at our shop and at customer locations and often need to voice over footage . this mic will replace theblue microphones snowball usb microphone textured white we use in studio and also themxl mics mxl studio usb condenser microphone cardioidwe had previously used for off site recording .pros good voice quality cleanly captures spoken voices good physical quality this is beefy mic that feels very well made looks professional while not important to the functionality it makes a good impression on our customers long usb cord allows for placement away from pc headphone jack real time monitor handy to listen to live recording and playback travels well includes a protective travel case that fits all of componentscons no pop filter included normally i wouldn t mention this but the instructions include a warning the condenser mics are susceptible to water damage like from breath moisture and a pop filter is essential . we boughtnady mpf inch clamp on microphone pop filter left channel only brings in audio on the left channel had to compensate in my editing softwaremisc since we do not do music recording of any type i can t comment on the mic s performance in that area software studio control gui downloadable can be launched to control some of the finer functions of the microphone but the interface is not intuitive and my editing software sony vegas pro gives me better control for what we dothe mxl studio mic more than meets our needs which may be different from yours .recommended !cfhi bought this as an interface between my mixer instruments and mics to my macbook for garageband . you have to go in and change the input and output in osx but it works great !
i bought this for my ford escort lx sedan so i could hear my sony stereo more . i followed the instructions and applied the product to my front doors . i have noticed a difference in the sound quality of my speakers . i can hear them more and there s less vibration on the doors . as far as road noise goes it helped just a little . this product isn t made to reduce the road noise just to help get rid of vibrations and make your stereo system louder and easier to hear on the road . the road noise level is still the same in my car .i bought about boxs for my pt . the top of my pt would make a flutering sound when driving not no more . also road sounds dimed down some . when it rains the top of my pt doesn t sound like a tin can anymore . . . .glad i went with the chrome and not the black one i hooked this one up to my gv motorcycle if you have just a little know how you can do it your self all you will need to go with this is a relay that does not come with it . you can get it on here or any part store i have made many people jump due to the sound of the horns loudness .
they should post the length of this and the length of the power heads because together they were too long for my tank .nice but perhaps bigger than i need . when placed along the long side of the small aquarium i have the hook brings the light almost to the far side of the aquarium rather than near the same side as the stand . perhaps moving it to the narrow side instead and on the opposite end of the aquarium from where it s needed the arm will extend long enough so that the light will be where it s needed . but then the cord needs to be strung up more awkwardly for my setup . my problem really not the product s .the stand seems sturdy and designed well . there are clips to hold the cord but they seem to be made of a metal that isn t particularly springy so they have to be bent in just enough to grasp the cord otherwise it tends to slip out . i haven t yet figured out that perfect tension or perhaps the clips can t maintain it because of the weak metal .this is by far the best leash i have ever had for my dog . i have a ylf and she is about pounds . this leash is the cord tape form versus the string form . this helps with tangles and just hurting more if it gets tangled or wrapped around something . in addition the hole where the cord comes out has like a plastic center bearing that forces the cord back in smoothly no matter where the cord is . so if the dog is on the side the cord still comes in smooth . the handle is very nice and well fitting . also this cord lenght is longer than other retractables i have owned . the extra feet or so makes a huge difference .
this inch airstone is perfect for my gallon aquarium !these are the greatest ball throwers we have found . . we think the inch one handles the best for distance and height !i dangle this heater mat from the center of my roach enclosure . it works well . i actually run this plus another small great choice brand heater in the enclosure . the room the roach enclosure is in averages about of and the roach enclosure with this and the other one stays about of .
you learn that when there is a power outage the cordless will not work because the base is plugged into the electrical socket so its a good little phone to have plugged into a landline that s there when you need it even if you have a cell phone . . . .because you could have a low battery and this landline though to some out dated it sure helps in a pinch . !when you need a phone during an emergency or power outage when you want a phone that is reliably located on the base where someone hasn t walked away with the handset this is the ideal phone ! the phone comes with a longish cord to plug into the phone base and phone jack . if you need the standard short cord to use with a typical wall mounted base there is a slot under the base to wrap the cord instead of providing a shorter second cord . i like this ! it s nice that companies are engineering with cost savings in mind ! the phone comes with pulse and tone dialing needed to use computerized dialing . i purchased this two years ago for one reason to have a phone i can use when the power goes out which happens several times a year .modern phones are terrific . . . as long as they have electric power . when the power goes out however they are helpless . i do have a deep cycle battery and power inverter for when the power goes out but having this basic phone allows me to have a phone without drawing power from my deep cycle battery . i can check with the power company talk with neighbors and potentially most important if there s an emergency i can immediately dial for help .everyone who owns a phone that plugs into an electric outlet and who lives in an area likely to experience power outages should have one of these for when the power fails . just store it in a location that s easy to access when you have no lights .
love this easy to set up chair . it is easy to clean and it s easy to remove ! i read in an earlier review where it was claimed that this chair was not easy to fold up and that it was too bulky to use when one travels or goes out to eat . i beg to differ ! it is super easy to remove easy to fold and it slips right into the little bag provided which is easy to carry . i don t know how it could be made any smaller and still be of such good quality . it is sturdy and holds my yr . old grandson who is rather long for his age without a problem . i suspect that he ll be able to use it for at least more year . he is currently lbs . and an active little boy ! he loves it too as he enjoys being up at the counter eating with the rest of us . an added bonus is the removable liner in the chair that can be easily machine washed . it also wipes off rather easily too with a damp cloth as needed . i d highly recommend this chair to all parents of little ones from mos . on up to maybe the cut off weight is lbs . so it just depends on your little ones build rather than age .this chair has been great . it took our son a long time to be able to hold his head up but once that was accomplished and he could sit up comfortably he absolutely loves this high chair and so do his parents ! it is easy to take with you in the car and to restaurants . our peanut was in some ways too small for a lot of the high chairs we came across and this one made it so easy to sit him at the table wherever we were eating . it is really easy set up as well . one strap around the back and one strap around the bottom and you are all set . it is plastic so it is easy to clean up . the tray is a little difficult to get on and off but it gets easier with practice and you really don t want it to come off easily since your baby will smack it around . i highly recommend and do not miss not having a high chair at all .one thing to be cautious about is that it is only as sturdy as the chair you put it on . if the base of the chair narrow and the chair is not too heavy your baby could potentially tip the chair on to which you strap this .i love our baby bjorn there are some days when our son just wants to be held . so put the baby in the carrier and you can still get stuff done . its also helpful while shopping since your hands are free . the only downside is that if you are busty its not always comfortable . but its still a great item to have .
got this because i needed a clean one so i can reuse my new differential fluid while fixing the gasket .easy to install in grand cherokee . i can now work under the hood and fix all the things the previous owner did not fix . i am batmani wish maf cleaner and throttle cleaner were in one can . but cautions are there so i buy them separately . i wonder if maf will clean the iat rhetorical .
as a lot of epiphone owners have learned cases designed for the gibson es clones won t fit epiphone guitars as the epiphones have a slightly larger headstock . this case however fits my dot custom like a glove . the padding is perfect the top is arched to precisely fit the guitar and the build quality is better than you might expect at this price level .fits very well on my les paul at first it look small for my guitar but it fits perfectly with my epiphone lp les paul electric guitar
these converters worked perfectly with my medela swing breast pump and my medela pump in style . i loved not having to transfer milk from one bottle to another .bought these because we were using a medela pump and philips bottles . of course the breast pump and bottle industry can t make it easy for everything to work together . these adapters fit great onto the pump and the philips bottles . don t feel forced to buy all new bottles or a brand new pump just to make your system work !these bottles are the best for switching between bottle and breast . my daughter hardly ever has to take a bottle but when she does she has no problem with these . she would try to inhale smaller nipples because they didn t have the broad base like the breast does and like these playtex nipples do . plus playtex now has a storage system for pumping into the liners . this set comes with an adapter to connect to the pump and some caps . you can also buy more caps . they make it so easy to store milk and then just pop it on the bottle . the adapter definitely works with the medela pumps . i think it will work with all except maybe avent .

this car seat base does not work with graco snugride seats . just make sure you order the correct one .i read in the reviews that this would work on a graco pack n play but it doesn t fit on the side when the napper bassinet insert is in . once my daughter outgrows the bassinet it will be fine and we still use it right now but it will be more useful when it fits . it does fit onto the end but sits at angle due to the curve .i bought this at babies r us . it did not fit my rail . it says it fits most standard rails but doesn t give any measurements . how are you supposed to know if it will fit unless you purchase it ? what a pain .
five stars because it works on my digitech gnx guitar processor which requires volts and about milli amps . this has an output of milli amps . for electronics the voltage has to be correct . but an appliance will only draw as many amps current as it needs . so this adapter is coasting when used with the guitar processor and can be used with other devices that draw up to the mamps . just be sure your v device doesn t require more than the ma this can deliver . but it s a power adapter i cannot be in love with a power adapter .i will start with saying this is not a class tube amp meaning all tube in the pre ampand the amplifier sections . i will also say that if you can find one used buy it . it is awonderful practice amp and can also serve well as a studio amp or a small gig amp . ipurchased this amp about years ago and love it .the super champ xd is considered a hybrid amp . it uses solid state circuits and tubesto bring you your hybrid watts of sound . the power amp is all tube and the preampis solid state and tube . i am not real technical when it come to amps but can tell youthis amp has had some detractors and a lot of fans mainly because it is a hybrid . thereis definitely plenty of opinions out there on the web .this amp has two channels one clean classic blackface tone channel and one channelthat uses digital signal processing to dial in effects and different amplifier voices .you can purchase a foot switch for about that enable you switch between channelone and channel two .the amp also has a speaker out so you can connect an external speaker box if youso choose to increase your decibels with a bigger speaker . there is also a line outto connect recording or sound reinforcement equipment . unfortunately there is not aheadphone output or effects loop .the amplifier use three tubes x ax and x v s . it s speaker is a inch ohm special design fender . if you want to get louder fuller and cleaner you could replacethe stock speaker with a eminence rajin cajun . you can also just break in the stockspeaker and see what you think . some players are comfortable with the stock speaker .with regard to tubes and speakers there are plenty of forums out there that talk about themods they use and the subsequent results from those mods . this is an amp you can easilymod and after a few years there have been plenty of people doing just that .i will say that the clean channel is very nice whether i play through my gibsons or myfender tele . i very much enjoy the clean blackface sound of the amp . it will breakupwhen you dial up to about or on the master .the digital voicing processor dsp from what i read from more experienced players arepretty darn close to the original . voices like tweed british think vox jangle fenderhot rod metal an acoustic super clean tone optimized for finger picking . there is alsoa clean jazz tone that has the character of the fender jazz king amplifier . again i amnot that experienced with all of these tones but many players have positivecomments about the digital voices .with regard to the effects vibratone delay reverb chorus and tremolo the opinionsout there is that they are serviceable but not authentic . it is often recommended to buya pedal specific for the effect you are looking for if you want authentic .if you want or need a highly versatile voice channel with a wonderful clean channel thisis the amp . it weighs only pounds . kg so it s portability is very good . this ampwas a wonderful deal at when i originally bought it in . it is still a good dealtoday if you can find one used .you can spend a ton more for a studio level multi channel interface but all i wanted to do was get two analog channels in and two out x on my bargain basement pc and this fits the bill . works perfectly with audacity and windows plug and play .
works great ! my child can not open it . i have of these installed . buy the extension if you have wider opening . if you have even wider opening place a piece of wood next to the wall i added an extra piece of x for one of the wide opening in the house . it gives the extra inches needed and also protects the wall .hands free operation is very handy when you have to hold the child or carry other stuff .we brought it for the space between kitchen and dinning room . we didn t want to drill any holes therefore we choose this . it clearly said can be hardware or pressure mounted . yes they are correct if you are not planning on using the door function to this gate . if you plan on opening the door part it will release pressure of the side of the gate . therefore you need to remount the gate . i m not feet but only a petite person and it will be hard if i just climb across .bottom line it s misleading when they said it can be pressure mounted ! please note if you are using the door it will release the pressure mount side .i installed two of these in about an hour . it would have been easier with two people the hole punchers included aren t great but the get the job done . the guard covered most of my railing from the base up to about an inch from the top rail . if you are going to cover a long section ft it can be difficult to get the full length to stay flat . what i did was punch a hole along the top every feet and used a zip tie pulled through the hole over the top rail to hang the sheet of plastic making sure the sheet was level and pulled tight horizontally . then i went to the bottom and every third vertical pole i punched a hole on either side of the pole as far in as the hole punch would reach and zip tied the sheet to the pole . then i cut the top zip ties and slid the plastic sheet down so that it rested level on the bottom and punched holes along the top a the same intervals at the bottom . two holes every third pole and zip tied around the pole . they supply plenty of zip ties so you can afford to make a few mistakes . the plastic is stiff but not so stiff that it breaks . the babies haven t defeated it yet .
this ink is great its the only kind of ink i can in my cannon cause a off breed of ink will mess up a cannon printeri have two different laser printers each with a special envelope slot that is meant to feed envelopes so that you can print an address directly on each envelope . there are two problems with both . first you can feed only one envelope at a time they won t accomodate a stack of envelopes . secondly half of the time the envelope jams and you must pull the printer apart to fix the problem . so i have given up on running envelopes through my laser printers .the avery easy peal mailing label sheets fit into the standard . by tray and feed flawlessly through the print track . i can print labels in less than a minute and each label peels off the backing easily and can be stuck to an envelope or package quickly .the drawback is you must run a sheet of labels through the printer even if you need only one label . but if you have a lot of mailing to do this generous quantity of labels helps get the job done quickly and inexpensively .this printer is the biggest ink hog i have ever seen . it wastes all of the ink colors even if you are only printing black text . it cannot be made to print black text if it is out of ink in any of its colors . it pumps its ink out in a ritual cleaning process that you cannot limit . my favorite problem is that it has trouble grabbing a sheet of paper from the hopper . the message is media out or not loaded correctly will be displayed and there is no fix for it . i can have fresh paper in it and after printing several sheets in secession it will miss feed and after several miss feeds it will get back to printing . we need a lemon law for this printer .

i am running an aquaclear on a gallon heavily planted tank . the filter is very very quiet . it does not give the kind of water cleaning and polishing that a canister filter would give but for the price its a nice choice . i have used this line of aquaclear filters on nearly a dozen different freshwater tanks for the last decade . . . they are my favorite hang on back filters .this is the first time i have not upgraded a filter in other words normally i would have gotten an aquaclear or for a gallon aquarium but for this tank i just wanted some water circulation . the tank is very lightly stocked and the plants do most of the filtering . if you are setting up a standard tank i would recommend upgrading the filter so you have nearly double the filter capacity on your tank . ie so you have a filter for a gallon tank on a gallon tank a filter for a gallon tank on a gallon tank etc . it makes for healthier fish and less maintenance .i have a prefilter pre filter sponge pack for fluval edge aquarium on the aquaclear to keep the cherry shrimp and fry from getting sucked up into the filter . the prefilter fits on the uptake tube perfectly and is working as it should .i recently ran an aquaclear and an aquaclear on a gallon tank . both of those filters were much louder than this little aquaclear . i m guessing that the more powerful the motor is the louder the filter is . i did try the trick of swabbing silicon grease on the impeller shaft and both of those two larger filters were still too loud for me . i am now running a canister filter on that tank and am very happy with it .i ve also tried the updated version of the aquaclear line thefluval c power filter . i did not like that filter as much as the old aquaclears . the fluval was not any quieter and there was so much hardware in the filter box that it really forced you to use only their filter media . one of the great things about the aquaclears is that you can put in just about anything you want in the filter box like peat moss or ammorocks or whatever your heart desires . i like that flexibility .as much as i like the aquaclears though i leave them behind for canister filters when the tank is any more than gallons . hang on back filters are ok but for a big tank or for any tank that needs top notch water quality give me a canister filter .i ve owned biological filters in my life this would be . i tell you what these filters have come a long way since back in the day with the biowheel haha . i love this stackable system with a sponge bio max media and activated carbon . the u suction system works perfect . i barely read the directions i just threw it together put some air on the top nozzle thingy filled it with water plugged it in . . . and voila . . . it works ! ! i bought the gallon filter for a gallon tank since it was like a few dollars more than the lower ones which makes no sense . i m not going big this time just a pet project aquariponics . i was thinking the gallon would probably equal gallon circulation but i was wrong this thing is powerful and very quiet . i almost have too much circulation ! ! my plants in the tank are almost getting sucked into the intake ! ! lol i definitely need one of those sponges on the end of the intake now . i was tossing around the idea of getting a circulation pump before getting this but now i have a biological filter and a circ pump all in one . works beautifully . time will tell of how long the submersible pump lasts . . . . if you are experienced with fish keeping then you know you want gph per gallons of water in your tank .the aquaclear with gph flow was amazing for my gallon tank with a red eared slider very messy huge bioload and several fish .the filtration media capacity is huge you can use different types of media and the carbon that goes with it lasted well over a month . you can buy their pre filled bags of media or just buy bags and fill your own for a savings . it s easy to take apart to clean the only issues i ve had were when sand kicked up into the filter and it started buzzing loudly . this is fixed by easily disassembling the impeller takes seconds or less to take apart and put together and cleaning it out .it couldn t quite handle my gallon tank no surprise there . so i have this and a gallon cascade canister on it now and my tank went from toxic to cycled in record time days with the aid of seachem stability .these two filters together are a force to be reckoned with . i went from dirty icky sandy muddy water to crystal clear over night . not to mention that my gallon stayed crystal clear with just this filter .
this is the only cat litter our cat will tolerate . if we use a different kind she just goes on the floor .our cat seems to love this . she is abyssinian maine coon mix indoor only . her fur is very soft and very clean feeling after use . she wasn t sure and kind of scared at first when using . spray on hand and then pet cat don t spray direct on cat .it s talking the cat into using it . my current cat didn t know what to make of this item . i have had success in the past with other cats and it works great .
i noticed several different descriptions about sheet protectors for sale on amazon . i had purchased some cheaper ones from a big box store locally . i noticed they were thin and not all that clear . i found just the opposite on these holders as they are heavyweight and very clear . i made a great purchase and when i ordered the pack i won t need to reorder anyway soon . i use these for pictures . legal documents insurance policies and a host of other paper items . i give away x photos to friends and family and i always use the sheet protectors for each photo . while the photo is well received i always get a favorable comment on the sheet protector . pictures and documents insert easily into each holder and multiple copies of an item can be easily inserted into a looseleaf notebook .what can i say ? it is a box of staples for use in a stapler . as stated there in the box although i did not count them . i have no reason to question the amount .this package of bright copy printer paper arrived promptly and was reasonably priced . i erred in purchasing just one package instead of a whole box oops !
i bought these discs after my little one moved from the oz bottle to the oz bottles . they allow me to use the smaller bottles to store breast milk formula and water . they work well on my avent natural oz and oz . bottles and can be sterilized in microwave steam bags .this bottle system is great for the oz bottles . i had no problem mixing a full bottle and the drop ins are a breeze . my only problem is with the oz . i always add the formula to the water as you re supposed to but you can t do that with the oz . i have to either used a different bottle then transfer or use something with a lid to make an oz . also be careful with the liners a box of oz drop ins i bought had several liners with holes . i called playtex and they sent me . off coupons for baby magic products not liners so it wasn t very helpful in replacing the defective ones . also if anyone has tips to make powdered formula in the oz bottles email me cjal aol .comthis sterilizer did the trick . we used avent bottles and oz and oz . you can get a set of bottles in this thing and it only takes minutes to steam based on voltage of microwave of course . i would recomnd this .
what a great little gizmo . . . .i had a boss rc looper it involved too much bending over for me .and too hard to figure out . . . the ditto is so easy . i take my trusty fender esquire . . .a cord . . .plug the chord in to a caitlinbread echorec pedal . . . .take a short cable from the output of the echo pedal to the input of the diitto pedal . . . . .then connect output of the ditto to the amp . . . .set echo for multiple head repeats . .i like the setting between and on the program select knob then turn off the echo pedal . . . . .get ready to play . . . .play the slow chords to maggot brain . . . .eminor . .d . . .bminor . . .c . . . . .count each chord as . .as you come to start back on the eminor press the ditto button one time with your foot it will record you . . . .play in tempo . . . ! . . . . .its slow when you come back to the eminor you want to press the ditto switch one time to stop recording right before the count its tricky . to make it play back smooth without loosing part of a beat . . . .but easy with practice . . .anyway . . . .as soon as you press the ditto switch to end the recording it will automatically start playing it back . then . . . .you turn on the echo pedal . . . .and proceed to jam on maggot brain . . till you achieve groovy ness . . . you don t want to record the rhythm part on to the ditto with the echo engaged that would make too much echo with both the playback and the part you play on top of it both echo drenched no good that would be way too echo crazy . . it sounds much better and more effective with a dry loop track and a super wet echo second guitar part have fun . . .this switch goes with the fender blues jr . iii series of tube amps . the connector is well hidden it is up underneath the main badge on the back of the amp and you have to reach up underneath to find it . these are single channel amps the foot switch activates the fat switch which gives a little extra boost to folks playing single coil pickups . for an lp or other double coil the switch is almost overkill . but this is the switch for that amp .before i purchased the fbv i scoured the web to see how it works with the pod hd desktop and even the advanced users guide leaves you thinking . .anyway i lucked out and found a used one going cheap and after some time figured out exactly what you can and cannot do with the pod hd desktop fbv express ii combo . . first in the setup screen do not enable the fbv express . yes i know this sounds dumb but internet scouring shows there is a bug that this is a workaround for . . . . read the fbv express users guide and calibrate the pedal . . there is no need to d l the fbv software for this .now . . in the pod setup screens you have the option to either have the abcd buttons as abcd or to be fs fs . this behavior is mimicked by the switches on the fbv .so . . in abcd mode you can a select preset a b c or d from the group you are currently in .b insert a volume fx and use volume pedal . . .exp c insert another fx enabled by toe switch and controlled by pedal as exp d tap temp by tapping the currently selected preset . .ie the pedal that is lit e enable the tuner press hold the current selected preset pedal f you have some basic control of the looper but cannot enable it . edit looper control is flawed . you can record and go to overdub but you cannot record then play stop the loop . . you can stop from overdub but not start the loop . seemingly an acknowledged and unfixed bugnice enough but if you are like me switching presets is way way less useful than switching fx blocks on off . incidentally you can combine blocks such that one pedal say turns od on and delay chorus both off or turn one amp on and one off channel switching . . yay ! ! you cry that sounds like me so its a no to abcd and mode fs fs it is for me ! . .so yup in fs mode you can do that you cana enable disable sets of block s using the four pedalsb use volume and expression options as above ie like volume or wah overdrive level delay fb etc c basic control of looper but cannot enable itedit looper control flawed as stated abovec enable the tuner ? . . .oh sod it . nope you can td tap tempo ? . . nope not that either .so in summary the express is better than nothing but certainly does not provide hands free operation of the desktop . . the shortboard is worth the extra or if you are reading this before buying the pod . . get the hd x instead .
pilot g fine point roller ball pens are my pen of choice . i consistently use black blue and red colored penspilot g fine point rolling ball black gel ink pens pack pilot g fine point rolling ball blue gel ink pens pack .likes i like the feel of the pen in my hand . the rubber barrel grip is comfortable and allows me to write for extended periods of time . i like the way the ink rolls off of the pen tip and the ink has a nice look on the paper . there is a sufficient supply of ink to allow a pen to be used for a long time not as long as your basic bic pen but still long enough . i like the retractable pen tip so i don t have to worry about losing pen caps . this pen is affordable ! you can buy replacement ink cartidges so you don t have to toss a pen once its ink runs dry .dislikes though i very much like this pen it s not perfect if you use the pen top draw long lines across a page ink collects at the pen tip and leaves a large blob on the page . if you forget to retract the pen tip and then put the pen in your shirt pocket ink will be wicked out of the pen and leave a large ink stain on your er . . .my shirt this happened to me . the ink will run if it gets wet . it s nice enough that my wife and kids make off with my pens when i m not looking all in all this is an excellent pen but because of a few drawbacks i can t award it stars . even so i still prefer it over other pens i ve used recently .thanks pilot ! any chance of working out the ink blobbing issue ?uniball vision roller ball pen disposable fine . mm point this is a unique pen i simply must review . this in particular is the pen my wife first bought me accidentally instead of getting me my usual pilot pen . this writing instrument is a matter of health for me . so i think you should know about this .the vision is my favorite of all uniball pens containing uniball s special ink . it is slender and these days that makes it tough for me to write with it but i can live with that . the point for some reason reminds me of a fountain pen though it is a rollerball . the ink laydown is smooth and perfect all the time but this pen does bleed like a stuck pig ! its fine . mm point paradoxically offers a much bolder and blacker line than theuni ball jetstream bold point rollerball pens colored ink pens bold point which is a . mm point see my review .uniball is a renowned pen for its special ink called super uni ink or uni ink or a name to that effect which features a non bleeding special ink formula designed to thwart counterfeiters when used for check writing . this is because the uniball ink bonds with the paper the moment it is laid down that means when you write . this ink is long lasting permanent non smearing and non fading so we would technically state the lay down is perfect and . the ink reservoir is generous .when my wife first bought me a uniball pen i was pretty furious . never having used one bearing in mind i m a pilot man all the way when it comes to roller ball pens even though i love across edge capless gel ink pen jet black at . however i keep a medical log . this is no silly diary with entries complaining about phantom heart attacks . my medical diary consists of aide memoires about medications symptoms i have to track and any other problems .it is literally my life on notebook paper even my physicians have come to rely on that medical log during office visits . needless to say the pen i use for that log is vital . the uniball handles even the cheapest of paper as if it were her majesty s triple cream laid paper . it never commits any of the typical gel pen funny business . it does not smear bleed through even one side of the paper to the other nor will it ever fade . in addition this is the type of pen i love to use as a writer author and scientist .note of all the uniballs available be aware of the ones that have the special ink . . .not all models have it such as theuni ball onyx stick fine point roller ball pens black ink pens which is actually adequate but skips too much for my taste .the ones that do contain uniball s special ink besides the deluxe model are uni ball jetstream bold point rollerball pens black ink pens uni ball stick micro point roller ball pens black ink pens uni ball vision elite stick micro point roller ball pens black ink pens . all are available in packs of one dozen in disposable form and most also available in refillable ballpoint style . i advise the purchase of the fine point which is . mm .this is my pen of choice and of necessity for my medical writings . all of my review is the very highest and most sincere recommendation i could possibly make for any product here on amazon . this is a product upon which my very life depends . don t you think you owe it a try ? because i ll guarantee it . . . with my life .i enjoyed writing with fountain pens when i was a schoolgirl decades ago and over the years i had traded in the fountain pens for the ease and convenience of ballpoint pens . when i saw these disposable fountain pens by pilot i decided to give them a try since they were reasonably priced compared to some of the expensive fountain pens out there .i am so happy with the results . these disposable fountain pens are a dream to write with as they glide on paper smoothly with consistent ink flow . this multipack features seven colors i .e . black navy blue red light green light blue purple and pink . the lines produced are consistent with a medium point pen and does spread a little depending on how much pressure one exerts whilst writing .the plastic storage pack is convenient for storing all seven pens and the visible barrel indicates how much ink is left . these pilot disposable fountain pens are a great substitute for those wishing for a fountain pen writing experience without the mess and work that comes with the original .
not sure why most bulbs are sold in single packages but these light bulbs fit my gallon aquarium hood perfectly .this bulb provides uva and uvb which is crucial for bearded dragons and other reptiles . we ve had two that both lasted almost exactly months . i am purchasing a third .i suspect that some people do not have a properly ventilated fixture . you must have a deep fixture with a ceramic socket and plenty of ventilation around the base . i use azoo med deep dome lamp fixture black which sets on top of the screen cover but still keeps the bulb away from the screen .please read the instructions about how far to position the bulb from your reptile . if you put any uv bulb this one or the competition too close it can burn their eyes and skin .perfect for my and gallon tanks . had a larger version for a gal tank like another reviewer and i don t know what took me so long to buy the inch size . love it !
what a clean look for a cork board . it has a smooth light oak frame and plenty of room for pinning . it came with hanging hooks nails but i choose to use the command brand picture hanging strips . wish the board had come with that type of hanging hardware as i dislike the damage hooks nails do to my walls . also if a couple of push pins had been included that would have been nice .it is not a heavy board so it doesn t take heavy hooks hanging strips to put it up . this will definitely keep my papers where i need them .if you need a simple cork board for light duty only this is the one for you . it s attractive light weight and easy to mount . i would use only the smallest of pins because the cork is thin and the backing is cardboard . you can hang it horizontally or vertically .this board has sort of an odd hanger . it doesn t operate the way picture or board hangers that i ve used before were made but it s not difficult . usually you attach the hanger to the picture or board and then hang the whole thing on a nail or hook on the wall . with this one you attach the hanger to the wall and then hang the board on the hanger . but as i said it s not difficult . the board seems to be sturdy with an inexpensive but sturdy enough frame . overall it s utilitarian but not ugly and should last well .
i don t know how much you can say about picks but this is a versatile pack . you get a multitude of types and there are of each thickness . if you use a variety of picks or are wanting to test out other types of picks this is for you .i have tried many string cleaners and so far this one is as good as any . i like the applicator and will just need to see how long it lasts .these do not last as long as they say they do but they do last longer than most strings . i like them .
i haven t really used it yet for the reason intended changing the oil in my jet ski . so i can t comment on how well it works . the main reason for this review is to put it out there that it does not work with a chevy silverado . the siphon tube does not fit thru the bottom of the dip stick tube . it would be really nice if mityvac had a published list of what vehicles it works with and what ones it does not . i have my fingers crossed that it ll work with my jet ski otherwise there will be a new un used mityvac on slist . long story short do your research to see if you can confirm or deny if it will work with your vehicle before you buy it .highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering suspension work . you will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover .i hate to use the pickle fork . the pickle fork is the last resort for me as it will damage the balljoint boot .i prefer to use the snap on balljoint remover . if that one cannot fit then i will try this tool . if this tool will not fit then i will resort to a pickle fork .if you ve ever had to change the oil in your subaru you know just how difficult the filter can be to remove with the exhaust manifold in the way . with this handy tool you just attach it to a extension and ratchet and you can say goodbye to burnt knuckles for good .the technicians here at the subaru dealership i work at turned me on to these when i saw how easy they remove filters all day . i m certain that this would work on a variety of other filter sizes as it expands to fit . well worth the cash if you ask me .
when you purchase this product the advertisement leads you to believe a separate power supply is required but it does come with its own power supply . there is no need to purchase a separate behringer psu sb .otherwise the time machine works fine as described .should you need to connect a condenser microphone to a phantom power box so that it will work with an ordinary amplifier or mixer without phantom supply this is a good length for the link .i own a one spot but ran out of plugs for all my pedals . this product allowed me to lengthen my cord and provide the added power supply that i needed . no tone loss at all . great to have an extension rather than having to get another power supply ! ! !
we have two year old pit mixes and a month old apbt who are medium to aggressive in chew style . a lot of times the nylabones get overlooked or hidden deep under the couch but this one was a cherished toy . our male would carry this around showing it off to everyone . all three really enjoyed the texture and it lasted a good month before it was sent to chew toy afterlife .my puppy is a yellow lab and he loooves his dino toy . he has had it since he was months is months now and chewed off the head tail and legs and still is thrilled with it ! ! it s his fav . toy ! i would recommend it for anyone whith a large breed puppy teenage dog .ok starter dish for a puppy . probably better for a small grown dog or cat . only lasted about weeks before my puppy was using it for a toy .
we are a long established technology based counsulting and services company . we have thirty computers and nine hp printers on the lan . we bought two s for use at work stations for light to medium use pages per day .we could not be more pleased with the quality of the printed pages and the operation but avoid heavy use because of excessive ink cost per page . this is the reason why the printer cost seems absurdly low . scanner printer and fax all worked great . the unit is very very compact and handsomely styled a far cry from the earlier all in ones that these replaced . the paper feed tray could perhaps be improved . a small amount of care must be used to prevent stuffing the paper in too far .print cartidges have very little capacity . the color cartridge has a list price of . and yields standard pages . that s cents per page . for the same standard page our older hp r all in one delivers pages for a list price of . or . per page . i have not investigated black printing costs but the black cartridge is also small . googling cost per page and printer model will get you the cost info from a third party .pros small footprint relatively quiet good quality printouts uses the hp a cartridge this size cartridge is rated for pages vs hp successor cartridges for personal laser printers eg hp a cartridge which is rated for pages refurbished toner cartridges are widely available cons no windows drivers compared to my previous printer samsung ml the prints a lot slower especially noticeable with multi page pdf documents in conclusion this is a good little printer for light occasional use .hp makes good laser printers . i was not disappointed by this model it produces good black white prints it has good print speed it is relatively quiet it has a very small footprint and it never jams .however over the years of owning this i would say the best additional feature of this printer is that it uses the hp a cartridge . hp does not have any current models that use this size toner cartridge anymore . its successor to this printer model the hp laser printer uses the hp a toner cartridge .there is a big difference though . . . the a is readily available at costco . for as long as i ve owned this printer costco has carried this cartridge .also the compatible toner cartridge for the a is readily available through amazon at a fraction of the cost of the hp brand . this has really knocked down my printing costs for this printer .the a cartridge is rated to yield pages compared the a in their more recent models which yields pages using a compatible toner cartridge i now print for about one penny per page . . . i don t think that is possible with any other laser printer product .
when you need a phone during an emergency or power outage when you want a phone that is reliably located on the base where someone hasn t walked away with the handset this is the ideal phone ! the phone comes with a longish cord to plug into the phone base and phone jack . if you need the standard short cord to use with a typical wall mounted base there is a slot under the base to wrap the cord instead of providing a shorter second cord . i like this ! it s nice that companies are engineering with cost savings in mind ! the phone comes with pulse and tone dialing needed to use computerized dialing . august . i purchased two of these phones to wall mount in my basement and garage . they work meaning they ring but i get complaints about voice quality on every call . cost was . each with free shipping assuming the order totaled at least . despite some remarks that these phones can not be wall mounted those statements are simply not true . i have two of these phones both of which are currently wall mounted . as noted in the instructions you must reverse a clip on the base unit for wall mounting . that clip then provides a tab hook that keeps the phone firmly in place on the base unit . this type of arrangement is essentially universal to all phones that i ve ever seen that can be both used horizontally or vertically . to switch the tab from horizontal to vertical mounting took less than seconds .another bit of confusion . a few reviewers state that the cord from the base to phone is hard wired and can not be replaced with a longer one . that is not true at least in . the cord has standard clips on both ends and can be replaced at will .yet despite that mis information i m very disappointed with the voice quality . every time i answer these phones people complain unsolicited about the voice quality . a hard wired phone as opposed to a cordless should sound great but clearly these phones don t ! your only real option for a better hard wired phone would be a panasonic at about . .this stand was used to hold an acer v wbd widescreen tft lcd monitor . the built in monitor stand was easily removed before attaching the monitor to the neoflex . the holes on the back of the monitor matched up perfectly with the plate on the neoflex . completing the install was a cinch . the monitor can be lifted vertically using a spring loaded mechanism . it can be rotated degrees tilted and rotated about the base . couldn t ask for more flexibility . my wife s macbook will be connected to this setup as soon as we get the adapter cord . well made and solid unit should last for years ! buy it ! ! !
this pedal solved my problem with my amp . after years of messing about with my mesa boogie realizing the the california sound is not what i truly like and kicked myself in the ass for not buy a marshall or vox this pedal has given me the ability to make my amp sound like a marshall or vox . one can say all kinds of things about quality but for . it made me even more versatile . it needs to be in front of a tube amp . . .there are several types of practice amps . high end modlers line g dec vox vt that can still run and are typically overloaded with features . the low end tubes fender blues junior bug v peavey valveking etc . these typically are more stripped down in features not neccessarily quality . and then there are the micros . i always thought they were just a notch above toys the sort of amps found in a prepackaged guitar set up from wally world at christmas .boy was i wrong . . .i needed a portable amp for my son to take to and from practice after school . it was important to me that he could schlepp his own gear . he s not a big kid so even lb . amps are pushing it plus a gig bag and school back pack . that was initially what brought me to the micro . not sound or features just the smallest possible amp for my little virtuoso . turns out this is an amazing amp . the tone destroys the line and the features crush the vox pathfinder watt ? or bug v . and the fender frontman not even in the ballpark .each of the models are distinct . the cleans are sparkly more trebly and the high gain models are very articulate . obviously this isn t a loud amp but that s not all bad . you can get everything this amp has to offer at reasonable volumes . it also can be battery powered the life is suprisingly long includes a regular wall plug headphone jack built in tuning fork which is kind of lame and a series of onboard effects that can be run simultaneously . for example i was able to crank up the delay and tremelo and pull off some dick dale surpher licks with suprising accuracy .don t let the size fool you . i honestly thought it was nothing more than a toy and i couldn t have been more wrong . there are several big websites and it s tough to find any negatives about this amp . quality sounding and durable for a great price .oh and the red if you can find it looks pretty sweet too .constructionthis amp certainly looks sharp . it is not nearly as heavy as i would expect a w amp to be but seems well put together .controlsthe iii comes with a button foot pedal which feels very solid and works perfectly . you can expand to add an optional button switch that fender sells separately and also includes in the iv and v . on the amp you have separate eq knobs treble mids and low you have a gain a volume a master volume and a reverb . along with these you also have an lcd screen that tells you which amp model you are using with witch pedals presets delays and reverbs . you also have separate buttons for changing amp models reverb delays and modulation effects . the large knob on the top actually scrolls through presets and once you press it you can go into deep editing of the amp models effects and presets .the controls are intuitive and easy to use . it is a great mix of visual digital feedback as well as tactile knobs .comparing to other amps the fender gdec does not have as much deep editing available on the amp itself . you need to use your computer to edit and download settings properly . but on the mustang iii you do not feel that you are missing out on editing functionality by not keeping it plugged into a computer .i don t know of another amp that has controls that are both as intuitive and as powerful .the sound most important let me first compare this amp to what line vox and peavy have offered in the past . all of the companies that have gone heavy into the amp modeling offer endless numbers of sounds and effects . . . but . . . how many of those sounds are useful for guitarists who are learning and trying to create sounds based on music that has inspired them ? line offers tons of sounds . . . most of them are what i would call niche sounds that are only useful when recording a weird intro or some crazy effects laden sound . what i find with line is that their vintage tones are very digital sounding and sound over processed . they don t sound overdriven they just sound distorted . also line offers oodles of sounds for progressive rock metal and maybe even some weird jazz fusion . these sounds are unique and interesting but the vast majority are of no use to someone like me who is learning to play the songs that i love and looking for useful rock blues and metal tones .what i can say about the mustang iii is that the tones do not sound digital or overly processed . the vintage amps have some great overdriven types of sounds . these are very passable sounds and fantastic models of the real thing . you can find the actual base amp models in memory banks . by playing these sounds you get a real feel of what you can do to the amps . a few of the sounds that are simply amazing to me are champ this amp model sounds so convincingly cool just like a little inch champ . tons of character and tone . you can get some really cool vintage type blues sounds through this amp model . think the jimi blues cd . the presets that use this amp that fender created are all really fun and sound amazing .fender bassman wow ! you can get some great bold rock sounds out of this amp model . it has the recognizable tone of the bassman modeled really well . big bold bottom end with some singing highs . deluxe is a fantastic all purpose amp model . throw an overdrive pedal on there and play some great classic rock blues . or leave it alone for a beautiful clean tone .the british amps are all good models of vox and marshall type amps . they are all bold and in your face . just play one acdc riff into the s amp and you ll recognize the sound .as far as the vintage tones go . . .i dare you to find anything that models vintage tones this well anywhere . if you play rock blues country hard rock or jazz you have so many great choices . people who play in churches will love the variety of clean tones for your lighter stuff and good overdriven rock tones for faster paced songs .what surprises me is that fender has strongly marketed this amp for people who play heavy music . i was worried that the heavier amp models would not be nearly as good .i was wrong . the s stack can get nice and grungy or crunchy as you like it . i m pretty sure that this is a mesa boogie type of model . this is certainly your metallica amp .the metal is for all of your nu metal needs and can be pulled back a little to play some cool thrash sounds too .the big bonus for heavy guitarists in my opinion though is the supersonic . this amp has a lot of great character and you can make it bluesy or really make it heavy and bold to play metal thrash or whatever . if you overdrive it with a built in pedal you can get some great raw and heavy tones out of this . i play some metal and hard rock as well as the classic and blues stuff that i like . i personally will play all of my heavy stuff on this supersonic amp .the fact that you can take any of these basic amps and layer effects and pedals on them gives you absolutely infinite combinations of tones . you can have one guy who sets all presets with vintage tones and another guy who has all of the presets filled with metal and thrash . it is limitless .i would without a doubt choose this amp over any modeling amp out there for practice and fun .i own a pimped out mim strat and a off the rack classic vibe strat and tele as well as a les paul style guitar . they all sound very cool on this amp . the classic vibe s strat really impresses me through this amp . so versatile with so many great sounds and such a high quality sound . i am really loving it !this amp can play really really loud with it s watts but you can also play it with great tone at very low volumes . i have kids and practice at night and this amp is perfect . fender fuse and ableton softwarei have to admit that i really don t feel a lot of need to dive too much deeper into sound editing than what i can do manually on the amp . however you ll find amazing tones all over the fender fuse . the system is super easy to use and store on your amp . as with any open online forum you will have to wade through tones that you don t love and aren t described well . but you will find some gems too .i have not had time to dive into the ableton recording software yet so i will have to save that review for later .the final wordi am a father of who needs an amp that sounds great at low volumes . i like vintage tones as much as heavy stuff so i like a variety of tones . i hate overprocessed guitar tones . this amp is perfect for me . perfect . the amp models are great and the factory installed presets are a great variety of usable sounds . it comes with a built in tuner tap tempo effects a two button footswitch an effects loop a digital interface deep editing computer software a headphone jack a usb port recording software and moreat this amp costs less than effects pedals that friends of mine have purchased . i have a strat that i love that sounds beautiful through it . after buying it i have listed a tube amp and several effects pedals that i have loved because i no longer will play it .there is no better modeling amp for my needs !
i think these are great for the price they give you . john mayer uses these picks and hes one of my favorite guitarist so i am sticking with these .great product . i have ordered or or these .these are definitely my favorite strap locks there are plenty out there but these ones are mine i ve always been a huge fan of jim dunlop products and will continue using them for years to come
basically you buy a pack of sticker sheets . the sheets are uncut and . by . they fit into any printer and you can download templates or use your own . you can print any kind of sticker graphic picture text from word anything goes then you cut out your graphic in the shape you want and you have a custom sticker . the possibilities are endless .the sticker project paper would be especially fun with kids allowing them to pick a graphic then print them a sticker . they can print one sticker or a page of stickers . i love easy projects like this for kids . i would recommend this product and especially use it this time of year .the project paper kit is simply . x inch sheets of paper with a sticky back . they are whole sheets that you put into your printer and create whatever sort of sticker you want . after creating and printing you just cut out the sticker you created . there is no template or special software needed as it s just normal paper with glue underneath . i used drawing from openoffice to create my stickers and it worked fine .it s a good concept and cheap and easy way to organize your stuff in a funner way . the stickers are pretty sticky but don t feel like they will permanently stick . i have been able to apply and remove stickers from plastic jars with ease .i recommend this kit if you are into crafts .these are pretty nice overall . avery sends an instructional insert for help with formatting with various products from microsoft corel adobe and borderbound . i m using ms word so the instructions provided do not apply . but i received help from word and was able to easily create a text box for the labels . the size you choose is up to you as you are creating the box itself . the text box holds a large version of the first letter of my last name . if you go with a text box you can use shading and color rotation and other word preset options such as shadow and d . you need some time to play around with it a little use your imagination and see the endless possibilities .i do not like the relationship of text box to text . it s simple to just use your spacebar to move text around the box but it can also be more limiting that having separate fields . to duplicate text box from one label to the next it is not as easy as copy and paste . perhaps in earlier versions of word you will have no problem as the instructions suggest . but in when you copy the box it superimposes itself onto the original graphic and you must then drag it to other labels each time . clipart on the other hand copies and pastes with ease as will their other preset options they copy as an entire label not as separate text box text parts . microsoft s clipart gallery is apparently very large but you can also use your own art you just have to add it to microsoft s gallery . their ready to use gallery is basic but i found a cornucopia for thanksgiving . you can also insert an image which takes you right to my docs . i m having problems with inserting clipart and images from my docs as far as adding return address alongside as the text cursor ends up on the bottom right corner of the image so the text does not fit on the label . i ve been trying to make this work using text alignment and direction to no avail . frustrating ! !use your printer s highest quality settings as suggested by avery . but make sure you allow the ink to dry for a good minutes before touching peeling off and applying or the ink will come off as you apply . nb cannot comment on how well color inks work on this gold foil as i use grayscale printing exclusively .
works just like it needs to . perfect fit for the tailgate on my chevy when the oem clip busted .great fitexact replacement from oem . exact fit worked perfect . have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs .
on the plus side it does the job powers your v pedals and doesn t break the bank . . .on the down side this unit can be a bit noisy depending on which wall socket you have to plug into . neon lighting can raise hell with this power supply . . .but who ever said playing out live was gonna be easy ? best to have a noise gate handy . . .just in case .let me start off saying that you cannot go wrong buying any of the series of mighty bright music stand lamps . the orchestra lamp in particular is a fantastic product . it provides plenty of smooth even light and is sleek in design . and the carrying case makes it very portable . fits best on flat metal and has a tight clamp . i have a portable stand which does not have a flat metal base . . .so i used a sturdy piece of foam board to clamp to . . .works great . the unit uses three aa batteries . i started off using batteries and they do work but light drops off within about four hours . i prefer to use the foot adapter cord . i am an older person who has old eyes . sometimes lower c and lower a look alike . mighty bright orchestra light to the rescue ! the clip is also much larger than the image would let you believe however the base is curved to allow your music to easily lay on top .some comments have indicated that when plugging the ac adapter into the base apparently did not disconnect the batteries as expected . the unit i purchased does disconnect the batteries upon insertion of the power cord into the clip . to confirm this on your unit disconnect the ac adapter from the wall and from the light load batteries into the clip and turn on the light finally with the ac adapter still disconnected from the wall outlet plug the cable into the base . the light should go out . if it doesn t your unit is not isolating the batteries from the ac adapter and may present a fire hazard if the batteries are installed when the ac adapter is plugged in .this pedal is solidly built and works as advertised . if you re using it strictly as a volume pedal it does the job nicely .the only problem with it is when you use it as an expression pedal it has no polarity switch for expression output .plugged into some gear as an expression pedal my digitech rp for example the down position is muted and the up position is full volume the opposite of where it should be and wah effects are backwards as well . there s no way to correct this without making your own crossover cable which requires destroying a perfectly good patch cable .
we were looking at the glass door inserts but not only do they not allow your sliding door to lock but they are hundreds of dollars . since our only goal was a way to let our cats in and keep the flies out during the day we were leaving our screen door open for them this seemed like a perfect alternative .it was easy to install i do suggest leaving a little more screen then they suggest when you are doing the cutout and works great for letting them in and out .a couple of items about it to help you make your decision if you live where there are alot of mosquitoes or gnats they will be able to fit btwn the cracks in the unit . you will have to close the glass door to keep them out . works great for areas like ours in ca where we just have to worry about flys and wasps .i recommend installing it in the middle of the door . when i lock the cat door they paw at it if they want to go out and it can get rough on the screen . we installed it in the middle of the door and so we can just close the glass door halfway to keep them from pawing at it .i was worried my dogs would get confused as to which doggie door to use . i have a patio door doggie door and when i closed my screen door my dogs could not get in or out . now with this in my screen door i can close the screen and my dogs can still get in or out . great idea and works well with the patio doggie doors . they are so smart they know which to use and when .as a foster furmomma for a cat rescue and a cat slave to my own cats this prodcut is a dream come true and has been saving my life for years now ! worth every penny you pay if you avoid the high retail and worth the time it saves . yes they do break down what doesn t ? but with a little care and obvious common sense these work for years ! you do have to break them down a few times a year for a good cleaning and keep the track the rake rides in halfway clean but otherwise still the best thing . i will never be without them or without a spare in the closet just in case !one suggestion is that the manufacturer scale back the side panels of the receptacle lid so that these can function in a smaller space when the rake hit it such as in a closet without hitting the doors . i have of these units in a closet two on the floor and two on a shelf a little higher and have them side by side . i broke one when the lid sides pushed against the back inside of the closet door when raking to the receptacle because someone had shut the closet dorr partially . so making those flaps shorter would greatly reduce the actual amount of space the units need to take up functionally .
they can be washed over and over in the dishwasher and at the same time can be thrown away without guilt when out and about as they are so cheap .this is a nice option to the disposable ones . . . . easy to wash and comes with its own bag for washing .my only complaint is that after or washes the fabric may start to pill . i use lanolin so i make sure to pretreat these with some dish soap and allow it to sit overnight . be sure to use the included mesh bag as these can become trapped under your upright washing machine agitator .
clear cover on the outside inside slips on inside of cover . rings snap open and closed with ease ! perfect for one subject or topic !long . x and solid .not your typical x box the fellowes boxes are heavy have reinforced holes where they are tied shut a plastic pull out handle on one end and the usual holes on both sides for lifting . straight for stacking that xtra length sure is welcomed !perfect for magazines comics documents and easy to fold together .from opening box to ready to use is only about mins nothing to do but attach the weighted legs and put on the movable elastic band that holds pages down .while a great idea this item is not designed well for all plastic construction imo .the only metal i can find is the threaded bolt on the adjustment knobs and what sounds like steel shot when you shake the base legs .the main plastic support for the books and it s adjustment point are very flimsy and it s a plastic to plastic contact area no matter how much pressure you put on the tightening knobs you can t stop the legs from flopping side to side by an inch either way . also slips down when you have heavier book on the stand .thought i must have them attached wrong but they are correct .maybe some masking tape under the clamps might close the gaps a bit and make it tighten up better .i would suggest that you never move it around with the legs attached as there is only a very small lip of plastic on the clear back board to keep it all together and when that snaps you will not be able to use that area again .plastic legs are make heavy by filling them with steel shot or bbs through a hold in the bottom and then sealed with a plastic plug pushed in then covered with one of the stick on foam feet .this could be a pretty nice item with the use of a bit of metal in the right places rather than plastic imo .
soft and warm easy to wear .but after my baby can and likes to stand up i stop using it since he may trip over . i will use it again when he can stand more steadily .great crib easy to assemble it was pretty much assembled when it arrived ! my month old son who is almost pounds fits well in it but i had to double wrap a bumper pad around it so he wouldn t roll into the cold metal ! i am not sure how long he will fit into it but i love its portability and how i feel there is no rush to move my happy yr old out of his crib . and its overall best feature is how you can roll it from room to room without taking it apart .it is a pain to change out the cards and to even get them to sit how they are supposed to . i felt like i was going to break it or permanently bend the cards when i changed them out causing me to do it less than i originally wanted to . i do love that i can change the height of how it hangs so it is always just right for the development . there is a great variety of cards and easily connected to our crib and even pack n play . it comes apart and stores very well until we are ready to use it again with another child . i would buy this again if i no longer had it for some reason .
excellent strap for the money . the leather is thick and supple . in fact the materials are so thick that it can be a little tricky to get the adjustment tail setup .a note about length some might find the standard levy s strap length too short so be aware what you need and note there are xl versions of these . for me many straps on the market in this price range are just too long for me including those from franklin dunlop bmf wide and mono even the short model was about an inch too long . i m a bass player and when standing i prefer my bass to be at or just above waist height . a few basses i prefer higher . i d suggest if you have a strap which places your instrument where you are most comfortable measure button hole to button hole and be sure you re ordering the right length .while this hanger is not unattractive and is well built i could and will modify it to better suit my needs . the design of the hanger causes the neck of the uke to stand off of the wall inches at the head and inches at the hanger itself and inches at the base of the body . this is not an easy fix but it is doable .this bench is well constructed and comfortable to sit on for extended periods . my only complaint is that i wish it had just a little more height adjustment maybe inch . overall it is well suited for most unless you are tall or a small child .
this thing has readouts and scales and no instructions on how to read any of htem . the swr is easy enough to figure out but the others are anyones guess came with some little wire antenna that is nowhere in the one sheet instruction that comes with it . the signal strength meter dosn t seem to register at all . it was cheap enough and probelly works but your have to find an engineer to tell you how to use it .although it is usually easy to spot a bald tire i .e . one with virtually no tread you cannot eyeball tire tread depth any more than you can eyeball the air pressure in your tires . instead you need the right tool . although this is one of the more expensive tire tread depth gages on the market the quality of construction and ease of use justify the price and definitely merit the five star ratings this product has received . here is why i like it . this tool has a nice heft is made out of nicely finished metal rather than cheap plastic and comes with a hard shell foam padded case which can easily fit into a glove compartment the dimensions of the closed case in inches are by by . the quality construction is evident . this is a very well made tool and looks better in person than in the picture . . this is simple to use . just loosen the lock screw push the slide so the narrow point on the left is flush with the metal face turn the unit on press the zero button or alternatively just adjust the slide until it reads zero on the digital display choose whether you want mm inches in decimals tenths of an inch or inches in fractions ths of an inch put the metal face flush on the tire push the slide from the ruler side until the narrow point reaches the bottom of the tread and see the digital readout . the whole process takes just seconds .i like that you can simultaneously see the reading mechanically on the ruler part of the slide which is marked in mm and nds of an inch . the new tires that i buy for my cars typically start at of an inch though this can vary depending on the kind of tire so you need to check what the tread starts out as on whatever tires you are using . therefore a reading of for me means of my tread is gone at which point i usually replace the tire . . opening the battery compartment and installing the battery are simple . this product comes with the necessary battery and in fact mine also came with a spare . . the digital display is easy to read and the digital reading remains on the screen until you either turn the unit off or zero it out to take another reading . although i wear glasses i can easily see the display even without them on . the digital display eliminates any guesswork as to the reading though as noted above you can also simultaneously look at a mechanical reading just to confirm the digital readout . . i have my oil changed at a place that indicates the tread depth on each tire but i bought this unit so that i could check myself between oil changes and also verify the readings i am given . this tool easily and accurately lets me do that .bottom line if you like using quality tools that are easy to use and work effectively then i recommend this product for checking your tire tread depth . this tool is handy for me to periodically check the wear on my tires and is also useful for those who like to buy used tires or are considering buying a used car and want to check the tire tread depth .the meter has all the functions you could ask for a multimeter in a compact size . the digits are large for the size of the meter so it s easily readable by middle aged eyes .
my order came from the witz and sons fulfilled by amazon .i ve bought hp ink through amazon for years and never once had an issue . this time what i received was questionable .the product is advertised as being in retail packaging and the photo shows an hp package .however when i opened the amazon box what was inside was not in an hp retail box . instead the ink cartridge arrived unboxed . there was no hp cardboard box . it arrived in only the hp inner foil package . that means there was no hp box no upc and of course no explicit expiration date listed .the only thing on the package outside of the hp logo is a foil code . in my case the foil code is sg . i happen to be familiar with the codes on hp foil so reading the two sets of six numbers in yymmdd format i was able to see that what i was sent had an ink warranty that expired about months ago back in august and was produced in february of .while many people use ink past the warranty date that should be the choice of the consumer . here it seems likely the seller removed the box to try to pass off a old product as fresh which is deceitful at best .good product . original packaging and box . comes with return packing directions and prepaid labels for recycling . wrapped in original foil .i ordered these pens on jan th they finally arrived on jan that is days later . ok i will give them that . but my gripe is this tnt deals inc shipped them out on the th via ups with instructions to deliver the package to the post office instead of my physical address . this considerably delayed the delivery of the pens . they arrived at the post office on january and finally got to me on jan rd . that is days via ups and days at the post office . if it had gone straight from ups to me i would have had the pens on the th at the latest . why they had ups take the package to the post office is beyond me . not only that but it was poorly packaged in a floppy plastic envelope that was torn and taped together . luckily nothing was damaged because when i ordered boxes tnt shipped of those plastic packs of pens . immediate storage problem for me . i will not buy from this seller again .
this product is one of the best to help fish keep their protective coat of slime and removes chlorine and chloraminesit works . it removes stains and no odors . i love this stuff and it is much needed when you have a puppy because accidents will happen . you should really get a carpet cleaner or clean your carpets anyways but this stuff will make carpet cleaning easier when you do itwhile it does not kill all the algae in the tank it does help control the algae and cuts down on needed cleaning and water changes needed to maintain your tank .
when i purchased this i d seriously hoped that it would make a real difference to the tone of my guitar . guess what ? as far as i can tell there is no difference whatsoever between this saddle and the original the guitar came with . this is not worth the money .i use this pedalwith my acoustic guitar and it just sounds great for the price and quality sound i can not get a better deal .behringer pedals and joyo pedals are definitely the best for the price and quality .thank u guys .i was not a fan of this particular capo . it was good quality and the price was ok but just not my style .
this review is for the universal bedside co sleeper which is exactly the same as the original except it s sized for beds that are inches tall the original is sized for beds that are inches tall and taller .after only a few weeks of using a traditional high sided cradle for our baby who gets up to nurse several times in a night we decided that we needed something to make moving the baby between her bed and ours easier . we chose the bedside co sleeper and we haven t been disappointed .the low side of the co sleeper is level with our mattress and the mattress of the co sleeper is about inches lower than that . this means that when my baby wakes in the middle of the night to nurse i only have to lift her four inches to get her into my bed . i don t even have to sit up to manage this . plus since there are no bars or slats between her bed and mine when she s fussy at night i can easily reach out a hand to soothe her or find the pacifier she s let slip from her mouth . the four outside pockets one on each short end and two on the long end are convenient for holding burp cloths extra diapers baby wipes etc everything i need for late night feeding and changing .some reviewers have complained that the mattress is too hard . actually i found that the mattress is padded but lumpy . this is because it s designed to fold up so the co sleeper can be portable and fit into a travel bag . i solved the problem by putting a quilted multi use pad on top of the mattress underneath the fitted sheet . the quilting helped smooth out the lumps and make the mattress more comfortable without making it so soft that i m worried about a smothering hazard . also the pad is good protection for the mattress in case of nighttime accidents since the mattress is made only of cloth with no plastic cover unlike typical cradle mattresses . be sure to buy at least one extra fitted sheet when you purchase the bed one is included with the bed itself since regular crib or cradle sheets won t fit .my only complaint so far is that the solid fabric sides of the co sleeper prevented me from hanging my baby s crib toys on the bed . otherwise i ve found this bed to be an absolute lifesaver and the only kind of infant bed i would recommend .we registered for the ultimate crib sheet because a cousin and a few friends raved about it they said to get two so that one could be on the crib and one could be in the wash . i received it at my baby shower but we have found only limited value in this crib sheet for our month old daughter . i am glad we only have one of these !the ultimate crib sheet that we have is the style with elastic straps on each corner one fully removable elastic strap in the center of the short end and two straps on each long end . we have a pali wendy in convertible crib and the corner posts are quite thick to the point where the elastic straps are not long enough to easily go around the corners . instead on one end of the crib we have to resort to wrapping the straps around the crib slats adjacent to the corner posts and that means there s slightly less than full coverage of the sheet underneath . since our daughter is a perimeter sleeper who likes to be up against the edges of her crib that is a problem .the majority of parents we know have purchased convertible cribs which have thick corner posts when configured as a crib or toddler bed . it would be easy for summer infant to make this sheet more adaptable to current crib styles by making the length of the corner straps longer or using multiple snap sockets to make the strap length adjustable . this sheet fits better on a standard traditional crib with thinner diameter corner posts .i also question the real value of this for older babies who move around in their cribs . we have the crib bumper on now despite not having used it between months of age because she is a real mover and likes to stay on the perimeter of her crib to sleep she was sticking limbs out between crib slats and woke up crying as a result . on the handful of occasions where she s thrown up in her crib always when she s come down with an upper respiratory bug she s inevitably hosed the bumper as well . in those cases we have to just strip the whole crib anyways so the ultimate crib sheet is of little real utility for us .i could see this being a big time saver for parents with traditional cribs or those with babies toddlers who often have various accidents in their cribs and need to frequently change a crib sheet on the fly . however we have found that a waterproof pad under a normal crib sheet works just fine for our baby .when cosleeping with an infant this adds and extra sense of security . the top half of the sleeper is great formed out of a rigid plastic tray but the bottom half is just the this foam mattress with no support underneath . because of this it tends to cause a downhill slope and baby slides down .we gave up on using this within a week and just put him in bed with us until we could buy an arms reach mini cosleeper .the close and secure sleeper might be helpful when used in a crib and when travelling but it has limited value in an adult bed or at least it did for us .
you can trust that this item works well and does not scratch your paint . i was always skeptical previously and just asssumed these things scratched the car . but my paintless dent removal guy uses one and highly recommended the california duster to me . he is fanatical about keeping his car totally detailed . and this product works so well that he never even washes his car unless it gets rained on . he just dusts it every morning before he backs out of his garage and if needed he uses some liquid instant detailer and a microfiber cloth after dusting if he feels like it . it takes a total of less than minutes to dust off an entire car yet the result makes your car look like you just washed it .i use the california duster before putting on my car cover so that there is no dust between the car and car cover . if you have a garage it s quite useful since dust settles on the car during the day when you are out and about and at night even garaged . you won t have to wash your car as often if you use the california duster . and dust won t build up if you use it often enough .before discovering the california duster i found that after washing my car i could only use my car cover for a few days before the car got too dusty to put a cover over . now i find that i can keep the car dust free and use the car cover for much longer which in turn means i don t have to wash the car nearly as often .i got the plastic handle california duster which was significantly cheaper at the time i ordered . although the wood handle one looks classier and probably feels nicer the plastic handle one feels plenty sturdy for the value oriented get the plastic handle one since it s the exact same brush anyway !i am really very happy with what i paid for the calfornia duster and would not hesitate to recommend one to anyone with a car or motorcycle . just be aware what it is not made for a car that is wet or very dirty . my only complaint is that it is not actually made in calfornia .when i bought a new car last year i wanted to get all new cleaning supplies so after some research i ended up buying this mequiar s package and it was a great investment ! i put everything in an easy to carry plastic tool holder i had so i m able to take everything out to the driveway when i wash the car and use what i need at the time .i regularly use the wash mitt car wash and quik interior detailer to get quick clean great looking results . one day after washing i noticed something on the paint that felt kind of rough . i rubbed down that area with a clay bar then applied some wax and it was better than new again .the car wash is great because you don t have to use much at all for a bucket full of wash . i have plans to wax the entire car real soon to see how the gold class wax is to use but haven t yet .i m not a professional and i haven t spent a lot of time detailing my car but i did some research and wanted to get the best feel and look for my car and tried this product . i ve heard everyone talk about the clay and i really don t know the difference but that may be simply that i am new to detailing my car . anyway it took the contaminants off my car and make it as smooth as glass . i can tell from using it that it was smoothing out the surface of the car in seconds ! and it was fun ! i took the time and did my car in less than an hour and it s look great ever since .
they only fit around a standard thickness roll bar not the newer jeep arrangement with the plastic cover shroud of the late models .like others i have found the cover to fall short in the sizing department . i understand it s leather and unlike a comparable vinyl based product sizing is critical because unlike vinyl leather can t be stretched too much for a fit . this limits you to a steering wheel that is within mm of the product s diameter . i have tried fitting this on two steering wheels . first on my f and it was literally impossible . the diameter of the cover missed it by inches . then i tried fitting this on my saturn vue . now this is important because the vue is geared towards women whom have small hands ergo the steering wheel is smaller and skinnier . so you would think the vue is a perfect candidate . . .nope . i wrestled with the installation and would described it like sparring with a bear . after mins not including breaks i finally got the thing on the vue . the result was the leather had stretched so much it literally developed permanent stretch marks . also like other s who have commented in their feedback the wrap only made it barely halfway around the grip of the wheel . so there are now two pressure points on my hands from the front and back seams of the wrap when gripping the wheel .i gave it a rating of three due to it s exceptional quality . it is well made in the sense that its leather is very thick and the seams are well stitched . if this was right size for my application it would have rated it five .part of the poor fit was my fault since i didn t pay close enough attention to the specs and prior to ordering i should have measured my steering wheels for proper fit . i mistakenly assumed since i had two steering wheels and one that is especially skinny that it wouldn t have been a problem fitting .take proper care with the dimensions of x . measure the girth of your steering wheel with a seamstress measuring tape . if . does not cover at least of you steering wheel circumference and the wheel s diameter is great than inches you will be immensely disappointed or at the very least frustrated with the install .easy to replace . it lacks toyota instructions but it is exactly like existing toyota part with all wires colored the same way so it is very obvious how to connect those .the original part has a silicone rubber tube going all the way from top to bottom with wires running inside it . this part only provides a short length of tubing that at best would cover half of the length of wires on my car .i thing they should provide a telescoping tubing of two diameters with one going inside of the other while you are crimping wires and then extended to cover the full length of wires
i always like to carry extra cable when performing you don t know when one of the one you have breaks and you don t have extras what do you do then it works and it s great to have extra .i felt i needed a white strap for an extra one to have around . this makes a good spare but i would not use it and trust it on stage . it is thin leather and doesn t seem like it will hold up under any abusive situation . that s just my opinion of it you may not see it like that and have no fear of it . i would fear it .it does everything it s supposed to do . i got these for about here on amazon . the dunlop or schaller versions of strap locks are usually twice that with no perceivable benefit that i can see .they lock securely don t require any alterations to your strap or guitar to use them and they have different finishes to match your guitar s hardware .i have both dunlop and hennessy straplocks and i don t see any reason to pay more for the dunlops .
maybe i overlooked the information but you can t use just any regular headset or earphones with this unit . you have to purchase the panasonic kx tca headset . the unit does not come with the optional headset and the two models they did this in the instruction guide are discontinued . i purchased this phone particularly for the hands free feature it will be useful if they pointed out that only a specified headset works with the phone .at t e c . ghz cordless answering system with speakerphone caller idi replaced a failing panasonic corded phone with this compact cordless model after testing several at my local electronics store . i chose the at t e c for a number of reasons style the feel of the handset solid ease of use and functionality . a belt clip and wall mount are included .what i got was a well made attractive and multi functional unit with expansion capability up to eight handsets . programming was easy the standard message simple and clear enough to use without adding a custom message even though i did add my own .there are separate phonebooks in the handset and the base each capable of storing up to entries and the handset screens incoming messages . call transfer way conference calls and last number redial are additional functions of this unit .two lithium batteries are included note directions state only lithium batteries should be used caller id and call waiting are included capabilities if you subscribe to these services .both handset and base are programmable with features such as ringer volume ringer melody remote access and caller log review .all in all this is an easy phone to set up and one that offers superior performance .recommended .when you need a phone during an emergency or power outage when you want a phone that is reliably located on the base where someone hasn t walked away with the handset this is the ideal phone ! the phone comes with a longish cord to plug into the phone base and phone jack . if you need the standard short cord to use with a typical wall mounted base there is a slot under the base to wrap the cord instead of providing a shorter second cord . i like this ! it s nice that companies are engineering with cost savings in mind ! the phone comes with pulse and tone dialing needed to use computerized dialing . 
they are cheap when bought in the pack and they are very quiet . i need to order a couple more packs though !ordered a few of these . . .should come in different sizes . . .but for the price these are fine . . .keep em in every case . . .enjoy . .will buy againa good value box set of quality products . use these each time you re string and keep your instrument in top shape . i do guitar set ups for folks and these come in real handy .
you need nothing else to replace your string no matter if you have an acoustic or a electric guitar or both . i have a couple of acoustics and electrics and you can remove the retainers of the acoustic guitars without doing damage . is fast to tight up the string and it has a cutter if you like me don t like the extra hanging from the guitar like cat mustache .recomended !i liked the string spacing on these nuts . you could just drop it in and play but you will soon realize it will need some refinement . my open b and e strings with somewhat aggressive picking would buzz like a sitar . this was corrected by filing the slots with a back angle towards the tuners . some additional filing will be needed to remove the sharp edges . the base of this bone nut does not have a radius . so if your nut slot is radiused you will need to have it done or you will have poor sustain and possibly crack the nut in half at string tension . this is more common in vintage guitars though .my guitar s sustain was definitely improved with this nut . i highly recommend it !i tune my guitars ukuleles cavaquinhos and piano with various tuners like the korg ga or korg ca or korg tm and i pair this korg cm tuner clip and the difference is huge . you no longer have to worry about background noisei clip it on the headstock of my guitar uke cava and it tunes them quite well . on the piano i can clip it on any part and it picks up on the tuner . it works as well as most all of the clip on tuners you see on various guitars and ukuleles nowadays but if you have one of the chromatic tuners that don t directly clip on like the intelli imt series then this will make it work x better okay slightly exaggerated because the ambient noise is not picked up by the tuner s microphone .i give this accessory high marks and i highly recommend it .
great picks good to uses on lessons or situations that you certainly looses it . very sheep relatives with the quantity .great for the beginner !provide a very good sound minimal stretching past a couple of days of setting it good lows and highs good value
easy to mount solid grip on guitar . only detractor would be that with my guitar at least it hangs kind of far from the wall . this obviously is a factor of what you hang from it though . an acoustic would clear the wall nicely my solid body electric sits a few inches away from the wall .silicone coating on forks and retaining bands get a good grip on the guitar without marring even soft wood .i very much prefer this to having it on one of the accident waiting to happen stands on the floor .it works as advertised but be aware it s not for anything freshly painted or any guitar with a nitro finish . it will mess up the finish . nitro is usually used on your more expensive guitars like my gibson les paul for example . it s amazing how many guitar stands can mess up your finish that s a pretty major design flaw . but they just keep making them .anyway it is a nice little stand but be careful . if you have a nice guitar you ll want to cover the padding with some cloth to avoid possible damage .it works very well installs easily stays in place once installed but can be removed easily . does not scratch guitar s finish just be careful and no issues . it will not produce the sound of a unit that is built into a guitar but it comes very close . a great and inexpensive way to make an acoustic also be electric .
fits my car perfectly works perfectly was easy to install . the best measure of a wiper blade is that it does what it is supposed to do when it is supposed to do it .they do work . exactly as advertised . hane no fear on buying these . fit the chevy silverado wt tailgate rods .this product does not fit your toyota tacoma ! that s according to amazon .yes it does fit my toyota tacoma access cab .i don t know what that white powder is on the rubber seal but i cleaned it before installing the cap . no error codes and no gas stolen so far .
a great price on card stock paper . really put it to the test . it holds ink well and the weight of the paper is just right for greeting cards etc .i really like this card stock as it is scored making folding the cards easy and precise . it has a nice heavy weight and the ink is absorbed evenly for good looking cards .i like this brand of card stock nice weight ink absorbs evenly and the paper is scored making folding the paper into a card easy and precise .
the smead file folders with the reinforced tab are just okay .the pro of the reinforced tab is that it holds up better in the drawer and or with use .the con is that the reinforcement is created with an extra folded down section along the top of one side of the folder and this fold over effect is not securely held down with adhesive on every file folder . this means that your papers can get snagged or caught under that fold and may crumple or rip if you don t pull them out carefully . since i only have one box i don t know if this problem is batch specific or an issue with the folders overall .so if you just need some folders to hold papers and you don t have any issue with them sometimes getting a little bent as they come out they re fine but i d rather have a box of folders where i don t have to worry about whether or not my papers are going to get caught coming out of the folder .organizational overkill ? i ve been resisiting the impulse for awhile to invest in some of these folders . i ve seen them used in legal offices and they do what they were invented for keeping papers organized and in order within individual files . kind of like a computer file folder tree although actually paper did come first i hear . . .i m not ready to go entirely paperless at home so yes these are turning out to be pretty useful . they feel just a bit more substantial than your standard beigy yellow file folder being reinforced at the long edge all the way down the side that has the labeling tab . the choice of !neon ! colors will be either distracting or useful depending on your organizational needs .i m not going to invest in a dedicated two hole punch as i have several adjustable three holes . for light home use or for cheapos like me the trick with the holes which tend not to have pre set marks for hole use is to set the pegs on your punch a bit off center . your mileage may vary depending on your punch but i set my left side peg out to the mark which is actually closer to with paper flush left the center peg to the right of that and the pin that won t be used goes all the way to the right . thus pages punched are a bit offset such that if bound on the right side of the folder they won t as easily get caught or bent on the left side when the folder is shut . of course this handy flavor of smead fastener folders has a right side and a left side set of prongs so if i m punching a sheet for insertion of the left side of the folder i punch with the paper turned on its back side so it will back on its face be offset just a bit again away from the center .and that explanation is likely more obsessive compulsive than anyone requires but i m just saying . and yes papers you might actually need to find on short notice really do have a way of staying more reliably put when you literally pin them down .this review is from smead expanding file custom printed stock open top jan dec index x inch office product vine customer review of free product what s this ? i gave this product star for a specific reason don t tell me something is leather like and then send me a product that is made of paper products . the only thing leather like about this product is that they printed a pattern on a piece of paper and then glued it to both sides of the folio . i won t reward a misleading product description in any way .further they made a design mistake on how they apply the skin they think makes it look leather like . there is a reinforcing material at the bottom corners of the file . however the skin was glued on last over the top of the corner reinforcement . it won t be very long at all before the glued down paper starts to separate at the corner either from humidity or general wear . when that happens it will spread and eventually the file will look pretty bad .i also think that the file should have been made just a touch wider . it is ok if all you want to do is dump receipts and pieces of paper into it . however should you want to further organize your dividers by putting file folders into it that is an issue . while you can get a file folder to slide into it it is not at all convenient to do so and it has to squeeze into the wider part of the section where the accordion side is at its widest . if you want to put a few file folders in it you ll be out of luck . even making this th inch wider would have eliminated that problem . if you ve ever put receipts into a file like this and then tried digging around blind in the bottom trying to find and grasp them you ll appreciate how much easier it is to have them in a regular file folder that you can slide into one of these and then just pull it back out with the full contents .they make the claim that each pocket expands to ths inch . maybe in their dreams . yes if you virtually pull the product apart to fully expand one pocket sticking your hand all the way in to assist in flattening out the bottom you could get it to extend to ths of an inch . it wouldn t stay there nor could you conceivably expand every pocket to that width .i ve had a similar accordion file from globe weiss for years which has a higher quality glossy exterior is wide enough to easily slide a file folder into and has a fold over top which closes with velcro . . . to keep you from accidentally spilling the contents of your file should you accidentally knock the thing off your desk . i would purchase that accordion file product over and over again and never consider this one in a direct comparison and both are essentially the same price .
hard to mess up a floating square . it does contain the food .negatives . . . .to me at least the post that attaches it to the side is long . this puts it far from the corner .overall size float size is l x w . pretty large .inside float dimensions are approx . l x w .this ring could be reduced by a third or half . the foam material does support algae and is quite visible unless you keep the water level up to the black trim .i m used to a simple x clear plastic ring with trapped air floats . this type stays in the corner with the surface tension of the water .all in all i ll use it but wouldn t buy another due to the size .the specifications state x . x . inches . with the wheels it measures . in height . of course it will not slide into my pantry at that height .now i either place it outside in an unsightly plain view position or drag it in and out of the pantry . i will bet in a few months that the unit breaks after pushing and pulling since the plastic is sort of brittle . the corners of the wheels are flimsy and not engineered well enough for the added stress of daily maneuvering where the wheels attach to the unit .seriously pass this if you are on the bubble of a decision .ordered of the qt for lb bags of dog food . it says it will hold lb but the lb barely fits . i saw a review that said they put in lbs i don t know how . nice container with a lid that flips up on one side snaps shut .
this is the best crib sheet out there ! it can be simply used by itself by just fastening the straps to the sides of the crib or can be used with a more decorative sheet simply placed snugly in place over it .my daughter is now months and has leaked out of her diaper on occassion the mattress that she sleeps on cost around . so thanks to this sheet the mattress still looks the same as it did when we brougt it home .this is a sturdy gate which does not damage the walls . it can be moved to another location if desired . a great purchase and can withstand being manhandled by a toddler yet can only be opened by an adult .great ! lightweight easy to store easy to open can be packed in a suitcase left at grandma s house . tray can be a little snug since there is no way of making adjustments to it . but then again if you child is big enough they can just push up to the actual table .
this cable is an amazing find . it simply works ! i am not sure if some of the cables others have reviewed have had loose wiring in them but the cable i received is perfect .i plugged the cable into my windows laptop waited seconds while it recognized the cable and installed drivers and i was good to go . i plugged in a dynamic microphone opened the audacity software program hit record and it was amazing sound quality . i had previously used a variety of input devices from a jamhub to a behringer usb line input device to an art audio preamp to even going low budget with just a cable directly into the microphone input of the thinkpad laptop . this cable provides as high quality of an audio signal as any other reasonably priced device i have used .there are however a few limitations . . . this cable is mono only i .e . not for stereo recording . this seems obvious but is worth mentioning for those who have less experience with this type of stuff . this cable only works with dynamic microphones . if your microphone is a condenser microphone you either need a battery powered microphone or some type of phantom power source to power the condenser microphone .the really good things ? this cable works excellent at providing a good signal level to the audacity software . some input devices are either very hot too much level or have hardly any gain at all so this cable works very well by providing just the right level . this cable works amazingly well with a direct box to record a bass guitar acoustic electric guitar keyboard etc . i have a lot of direct boxes and this works well on all of them . i was able to record a bass guitar track with about the least amount of fuss ever think three minutes setup time from thinking of the idea to hitting record using just this cable and a hosa www .amazon .com gp product b ws q e direct box i purchased from amazon as well .this tascam us usb audio interface is exactly what i was looking for to record from our wireless mic with xlr outputs directly to my pc video editing software . we professionally produce instructional videos and needed this for voice over work on existing footage . before getting this convenient little unit we had to record into a camcorder and then import it into the pc so this saves us a step when we only need to record audio . here are my observations plug and play connected to my pc via usb and was instantly recognized usb powered no external power needed a big plus when using my laptop good sound clean and clear input multiple inputs xlr mic rca stereo line and hi z guitarmisc xlr input is not powered not a problem for us includes audacity software but we did not need to load ithighly recommended !cfhthis mxl studio usb microphone is a decent choice for those needing a portable or a good quality studio microphone . we professionally produce instructional videos both at our shop and at customer locations and often need to voice over footage . this mic will replace theblue microphones snowball usb microphone textured white we use in studio and also themxl mics mxl studio usb condenser microphone cardioidwe had previously used for off site recording .pros good voice quality cleanly captures spoken voices good physical quality this is beefy mic that feels very well made looks professional while not important to the functionality it makes a good impression on our customers long usb cord allows for placement away from pc headphone jack real time monitor handy to listen to live recording and playback travels well includes a protective travel case that fits all of componentscons no pop filter included normally i wouldn t mention this but the instructions include a warning the condenser mics are susceptible to water damage like from breath moisture and a pop filter is essential . we boughtnady mpf inch clamp on microphone pop filter left channel only brings in audio on the left channel had to compensate in my editing softwaremisc since we do not do music recording of any type i can t comment on the mic s performance in that area software studio control gui downloadable can be launched to control some of the finer functions of the microphone but the interface is not intuitive and my editing software sony vegas pro gives me better control for what we dothe mxl studio mic more than meets our needs which may be different from yours .recommended !cfh
there is rubber on the bottom for no slip and rubber on the top for no slip as well ! height could be a bit taller but most are about the same height .the cups are stackable and come with numbers on the bottom . medium weight plastic . they have slits in the bottom . so simple but my baby mo loves these !great smaller size stacking cups
this is just what i was looking for perfect size for the spare on my runner . looped it through the spaces in the wheel and locked in the back . nice for the added security .i purchased this to be able to attach a high end hydraulic assisted bike rake on the back of my jeeps jks with the rear tire still on . it fit perfectly and teamed with the bolt lock blt receiver lock keyed specifically for your line of vehicle it can be kept in the jeep and my daughter doesn t need anything but her car key .the extender is exactly as advertised well made fit perfectly and does eactly what it is inteded for .bought two of these for my grand cherokee limited . one fit well but the other was longer . i couldn t compress the piston enough to fit it and trying to screw it in ended up snapping the metal making it useless . i put the stock lift support back in and now i have one new and one old . it opens better but still not very good .
now that i have had this for months or more i m very happy i spend less money and less time on my aquarium in keeping it clean i usually receive complements on its clarity from visiters . i pull the basket every week to days and clean and put back takes minutes . about every or months i remove and clean the whole filter inside all the plastic parts easy to remove and clean this maybe takes minutes . only other thing is bottom cleaning and sponge the glass on the inside every couple a weeks after cleaning bottom and sides stirring up po this filter clears up my gallon tank in an hour or two . i use a lower power light and this keeps algea way down takes a couple a weeks to notice any . this is with four large goldfish and they are about inches large and poo factories . highly recommend this aquaclear filteri also bought sulfodene for my six year old doberman and it worked great but this stuff is better for a couple reasons . first it sprays on instead of having to apply it by hand .second it clears up hot spots within a day or two .the only draw back is that it smells a little weird . but i think it is meant to keep the dog from licking it off .these foam inserts get so gross and nasty withing one month within it being in my tank . it gets all black and muddy very quick . it says change it once every months but thats so wrong . if you did have it in your tank for months than the water would be gross .
frame is cute . it has real weight to it so it doesn t feel or look cheap at all . note that it can only be used for verticle pictures because the images on the sides are set to be vericle .we have been using the black and white cards on this mobile and they easily capture my baby s attention starting at around weeks old . she is now weeks and she is obviously entertained by it with big smiles when it is moving . it places some cards in a horizontal position so that they can be viewed from below perfect for the baby s perspective . unfortunately the designs on the cards and the horizontal position for some cards are the only great things about it .only some of the cards are designed to be in the horizontal position . i had planned to swap cards between the vertical and horizontal positions to keep it interesting but this is not possible . the only change i can make is to turn over the cards in the horizontal position to reveal the design on the other side . the cards in the vertical position are not viewable from below where the baby is . i will be looking into using some tape to place the vertical cards into a horizontal position .the method used to attach the vertical cards to the plastic arms and to the horizontal cards is rudimentary and thus a pain . the vertical cards have a small triangle cut out for placing the card on the knob at the end of the arm . the triangle is small and needs some force to push the knob through . it isn t easy to do when the mobile is already set up and hanging over the crib . each horizontal card has a couple of slits that look like cracks in the center one larger than the other at right angles . a tab at the bottom of the vertical card needs to be pushed through the bigger slit and then shifted into the smaller slit . again this isn t easy to do especially when the mobile is already set up and hanging over the crib .the design of the hanging parts limits the amount of circular motion . it will only turn approximately half a circle . it would be nice if it could handle more motion than that .great designs on the cards but poor execution for a mobile .holds a power strip and plugs okay but my toddler can still get her fingers down in the cracks where the cords come out and the crack between the front piece of plastic and the longer back piece . mine is also a white color not the cream like it appears in the picture .
it was too large for my dogs and the openings at each end are too big to stuff with treats can only use treats like peanut butter and or cream cheese .this is one of the only toys my dogs have not been able to destroy . i fill it with treats and peanut butter and it keeps them busy for a while outsidethis paste gave both my dogs diarrhea each time i used it . it s also got disgusting fillers . the price is way too high for how little use you get out of each can . just buy a large peanut butter or cream cheese or throw left over chicken in the kong and freeze it . why pay this if you can get x the use out of a jar of peanut butter ? i only caved because i had been curious for months and it went on sale .
i bought this ice coolant because of other reviews and comments about them . a few people that i know have used this product and it has actually did cool their engines down a bit . i didnt believe them much until i tried it . royal purple ice coolent does work ! ! just few degrees lower helps a lot in engine performance every little bit helps !i bought this on advice from a blog post i had read but i didn t have any noticeable results from it . i inherited an old yamaha scooter that runs well but the acceleration is a little sluggish and i hoped this might make some difference . i noticed nothing . other people might have contamination in their carbs that can be cleared up with this stuff but it did nothing for me .this is my first k n filter . i will be putting it to the test to see how it works and possibly buying one for my truck too . i have heard nothing but good about these filters having many friends with them installed on their trucks and cars . one thing i did notice right out of the box is it has more weight and is much better constructed than the fram filter it is replacing . i will give it some time and update this review .
the mic has loud voice in my karaoke . the stand makes my setting professional . you feel different when there is a stand holding the mic .this mixer has four mic inputs . it has some fun effects . this mixer comes with a hz filter and a band equalizer on the mic channels . it has a fx send that can be used as a mono output if you only need mono . i do not hear any external noise . it has a durable metalic case . this mixer has great audio .using this to mic my mesa boogie mark v x cabinet . it is holding a shure sm microphone . the microphone clip that came with the stand is plastic but i m using the one that came with the microphone which has metal threads .
i m an engineer and was looking for a good cart to wheel my reference manuals into the pe exam in october . i couldn t be happier with this cart . it s sturdy lightweight and the ability to fold up really makes it worth every penny . i stacked two document crates on the cart and used some bungee cords to secure the crates to the cart . the wheels turn easily and i think this will last me a long time . i recommend to anyone .i m always moving things around and can say the wheel is the greatest invention of all time . but the wheel must be mounted to a study axle and attached to a good load platform . put a handle on the platform and your good to go .i have two four wheeled dollies and two two wheeled carts that i use when they are handy but purchased this dandy cart as soon as i saw it .this is a great little wheeled cart with a reasonably sized load platform . it s light weight very portable and folds up easily . it will carry up to pounds .even the best designed product can be misused and damaged . an pound weakling can bend a heavy gauge steel pipe if he puts too much leverage on it . so as long as you don t expect it to carry a refrigerator or use it s handle to pry a heavy static load off the pavement this two wheeler will serve you well .i like it because it s so easy to carry around with you . it will easily fit in any car s trunk . it s light enough . lbs that a year old can carry it around . it won t rust . the diameter rubber tires roll easily and won t slip like the plastic wheels on many luggage carts . i m delighted with mine and will probably buy a dozen more for friends and family maybe they will stop calling me to carry around their stuff ! .i wanted a thin full size mouse pad for traveling . something that is light weight fits into a carry bag without taking up a bunch of space i can fold it roll it up or whatever and this baby fills my needs exactly . plus the mouse glides easily . i can also use it to set a hot cup of coffee on it while sitting at someone else s fine desk . perfect for me .
does the job ! it s basic tubing that fits tightly around the air pump outlet and air stone inlet . good length .these filters are awesome . nice and quiet . adjustable water flow . and the fact that you can basically customize your filter media is great . only things keep these from being perfect . the main thing is the gallon size they are rated for . in my opinion if it says good for to gallon size tank for example you are better off putting it in the smallest size of the range listed . the one i got for my gallon tank just seems a wee bit too small to really handle a full gallons so i ordered a larger size and will be putting this gallon rated one on my gallon tank . the second thing is if you customize your filter media make sure you weight it down somehow . was having a problem with my media filter floss floating to the top making the bio max sit completely above the water in the filter . using the manufacturer s media which i am sure they recommend does not result in this problem the sponges that come with these are firmly held in place by tabs in the media basket . bottom line . . .these are as close to perfect as you can get .i found this tubing is just a little more narrow than typical aquarium airline tubing so it isn t as easy to use with standard size nubs for accessories . otherwise it is perfect . works pretty much how you would expect .
i like the snap n go best out of all the universal car seat carriers strollers .that said my car seat the graco does not truly snap in . it is secure enough for quick trips but i would never want to have to use this as my every day stroller . also i am sure someone else has already posted this but the printed instructions that my snap n go came with had the wrong instructions for attaching the graco . the baby trend web page has the correct directions that you can download . even installed correctly it is not that secure .but i still say this is a necessary product because those car seats are so heave to lug around and this snap n go is so light and stays nicely folded up in the back of the car .the cup holders also get a plus this is approved for flight according to cfr part . even though there are still dangers of having a child in your lap like the baby getting compressed on impact a baby being jolted out of a parents arms is much more deadly . the or older reviews should be ignored anyway . buy this and visit the website for more info on how to ensure airline staff that it is approved for cruising altitude not take off or landing which is not clearly explained why . best scenario is to have a separate seat for baby with a child fit harness but for those who insist on a lap baby . . .buy this .a great idea to make it a front and back carrier but the baby bjorn is still easier to put on and take off which we also have . i didn t like the multiple straps to have to adjust each time my husband and i took turns with it . in addition this carrier wasn t comfortable on my short and petite frame . the waist belt was too wide and the straps had a luggage feel to them unlike the cloth straps of the bjorn . the straps of this snugli were also too long for my frame . however this snugli allowed my baby to have a better field of vision when she was positioned in the front and facing me . i also liked the vent . i do think that the bjorn is way overpriced although an excellent product and if you plan to use a carrier often a snugli comfort vent is easier to take on and off than the snugli front and back carrier and much more reasonably priced than the baby bjorn . above all i preferred the maya wrap for even greater versatility and easier to pack for travelling .
this fits our crib mattress tightly and keeps our baby from sweating against the vinyl of the crib mattress . we didn t have a mattress pad with our son and he would wake up soaking wet from sweating against the vinyl of the crib mattress . the crib sheet alone wasn t enough to keep him from sweating . this pad is also not too bulky so it doesn t cause a safety concern . just make sure the pad fits tightly on your crib mattress for safety s sake . we have a sealy crown jewel mattress and it fits great on it .this mattress pad is soft but not too cushiony . also the waterproof element is located inside the pad so you don t have too much of the annoying plastic vinyl rubbing sound or feel . the pad has protected our mattress from many a baby attack .this review is for the universal bedside co sleeper which is exactly the same as the original except it s sized for beds that are inches tall the original is sized for beds that are inches tall and taller .after only a few weeks of using a traditional high sided cradle for our baby who gets up to nurse several times in a night we decided that we needed something to make moving the baby between her bed and ours easier . we chose the bedside co sleeper and we haven t been disappointed .the low side of the co sleeper is level with our mattress and the mattress of the co sleeper is about inches lower than that . this means that when my baby wakes in the middle of the night to nurse i only have to lift her four inches to get her into my bed . i don t even have to sit up to manage this . plus since there are no bars or slats between her bed and mine when she s fussy at night i can easily reach out a hand to soothe her or find the pacifier she s let slip from her mouth . the four outside pockets one on each short end and two on the long end are convenient for holding burp cloths extra diapers baby wipes etc everything i need for late night feeding and changing .some reviewers have complained that the mattress is too hard . actually i found that the mattress is padded but lumpy . this is because it s designed to fold up so the co sleeper can be portable and fit into a travel bag . i solved the problem by putting a quilted multi use pad on top of the mattress underneath the fitted sheet . the quilting helped smooth out the lumps and make the mattress more comfortable without making it so soft that i m worried about a smothering hazard . also the pad is good protection for the mattress in case of nighttime accidents since the mattress is made only of cloth with no plastic cover unlike typical cradle mattresses . be sure to buy at least one extra fitted sheet when you purchase the bed one is included with the bed itself since regular crib or cradle sheets won t fit .my only complaint so far is that the solid fabric sides of the co sleeper prevented me from hanging my baby s crib toys on the bed . otherwise i ve found this bed to be an absolute lifesaver and the only kind of infant bed i would recommend .
these are great drawers for a storage room or attic until you need to open them . they are designed to be stacked . the photo shows boxes but this is a six pack so the photo is a bit deceiving regarding what you are getting . each drawer includes the drawer and the square shell .the problem with these is that the shells do not lock together . thus if you open the top drawer with no weight on top of it the drawer and shell topple over onto the floor . this would be easily fixed by a cardboard latch kinda like the handles of standard bankers boxes that links the bottom back rear of the top shell to the top back rear of the one below it . opening drawers below the one you want to open only helps a little .four stars because this is otherwise a great product but the inability to open the top drawer without it toppling over merits a one star deduction .otherwise easy to put together and well built .clear cover on the outside inside slips on inside of cover . rings snap open and closed with ease ! perfect for one subject or topic !great door stops ribbed on top and bottom . for really large gaps two can be interlocked and hold the door open .
i wondered how my dog would like this he doesn t like the teeth cleaning chews but he loves it i don t know how long it will hold up but when needed i ll buy againworks really well and does last for a full days . easy to apply . dogs don t mind at all . will continue to use this product .able to apply to one spot on my dog with little effort we will see how well it works over time .
the boss me is not as nice as the boss gt and will not let you install boss gt patches by james limborg . i recommend getting a boss gt and then install boss gt patches by james limborg . now your guitar can sound like eddie van halen joe satriani and other guitarists studio album guitar sound with boss gt patches by james limborg . search google for boss gt patches by james limborg .i purchased this product to replace the pins on my martin ny . i believe the ebony pins will be perfom admirably . additionally the pearl inlay lends class to the guitar .i got this because i was adding a pedal to my practice amp . this runs from my guitar to the pedal . works perfect and the length is just right to reach from the guitar to the pedal . this is actually my best cable and i think i will soon be upgrading my cheaper cables to these
i purchased this case for my newline pod hd . it s a well built solid case for the price . it fits the hd very snugly and has large pocket on the front for cables . i wouldn t drop my pod in this thing but as a basic light duty carrying case it does the job very well .this cover does not fit a full size acoustic electric hohner guitar . i measured the whole at but this cover does not even come close to fitting ! it measures in diameter so check your guitar closely !nice bag with great features . it is slightly large for a telecaster or stratocaster but works fine for either .i actually swapped another bag putting a les paul jr in this one and a tele in the gibson bag as thegibson bag was a really tight fit for the lp jr . headstock .
i used this so i wasn t committed to the . length id get in installing my canister canister isnt able to be directly under the tank the canister is off to the side so i was able to run one hose to the other side of the tank and cutting it to custom length and still had the factory rubber hose ends to go into the aqua stop valve ong the canisterdoes the job ! it s basic tubing that fits tightly around the air pump outlet and air stone inlet . good length .this is a replacement tube for the one that already comes with the product . it cannot be use to extend the tube for a taller tank without restricting water flow as the name implies .
i ve been longing for labels like these . avery s white internet shipping labels come through for my shipping needs . the solid white paper thick strong and opaque which successfully blanks out and covers any old labels found on shipping boxes i may wish to reuse . i usually pull them off but sometimes this ends up damaging a perfectly good box . the adhesive is strong yet it s easy to peel off the backing . i m enjoying having a half sheet label i don t need to use tape down myself . print peel stick and go . the convenience of that is wonderful !i do want share some thoughts and concerns . it may be necessary to use extra protection for foul weather . i ve accidentally rubbed off part off the ink when trying to smooth off a label which had gotten a bit wet on a rainy day trip to the post office . it was not just the ink that smudge but a layer of paper peeled off too . it came off a bit too easy which causes me to be concerned about foul weather possibilities when using these labels . . . . . program i found to be the best way to utilize the two labels on the sheet for shipping . i can opt to print on only one side of a sheet . similar applications will probably do the same . paypal prints the receipt on the opposite side thereby ruining the second label for shipping . i m going investigate this to see if i can change this . i would hate to ruin another label . concerns aside i am really happy with these labels and gladly welcome them into my home office .i think these labels are a very good all purpose label not just for an inkjet printer as you can use these by hand too .not only to label file folders or to label cd cases but i would also use these for just about anything i want to label like when i buy something in bulk and freeze it . i always like to label what the item is as well as when i froze it .these labels look white but when you peel them off they are clear . you can use either a pen or marker on them .the label size is ample so you can write what you need to on it . i have some labels just like this but they are white . i think i prefer these clear labels .i did find them alittle hard to see where one label ends and another one begins . i like that they come in a pack of . i doubt i will have to buy anymore of this size label in my lifetime .iam very happy with these labels .the main reason i like these labels . easy to use with my software programs . . print out perfect ! . was able to put a clip art on them . . last reason but the best of all . they peel off so very easy . i have to add that the avery labels have found so many uses from address labels for file folders recipe headings journaling labeling totes and i m sure i will find other places to use them . i haven t found anything negative about these labels and usually i don t like using them because they are hard to peel off .
avent bottles have more bpa than any other leading brand . bpa free brands include born free nurture pure mam green to grow baby life and adrini . for those that missed the news reports bpa is a chemical found in some plastics that a recent national institutes of health report indicated may be harmful especially to infants . philips avent bpa free classic bottle sealing discs work on both the classic and the natural . clean easy and are slightly rubbery for a tight seal .i had this very teether for my twin boys years ago and they absolutely loved it . so when my new baby started teething i sought out the same teether . i was surprised when it arrived and the packaging stated that the product is safety tested for bpa lead and phthalates . it does not state anywhere on the package that it is bpa free . as a former regulator of medical devices i am very sensitive about company labeling and statements . perhaps too much so . but i would rather err on the side of caution where my child is concerned and the lack of clear bpa free labeling on this product gives me pause . specifically when they test it for bpa lead and phthalates is there an acceptable amount allowed ? ! if not why wouldn t the company simply label the product as bpa lead and phthalate free ?eight years ago when i gave this toy to my sons no one had ever heard of bpa . my boys put all manner of plastic toys in their mouths and i m sure it was all riddled with bpa . but in this day and age when bpa is strongly suspected of being dangerous i cannot in good conscience allow my new baby to chew on anything that may contain it . and though someone on this site indicated that a representative from the company told them it was bpa free i m still skeptical . again why not label it as such ? most companies proudly label their products with that simple language that cannot be confused .
very effective safe for fish and takes only a small amount to work . buy graduated mil syringe so you can more accurately treat the water when doing water changes since ml can treat gallons . also make sure you use luke warm tap water so the temperature stays stable . i use an instant read waterproof thermometer which is designed for using in the kitchen and a graduated gallon bucket from h . d p . check the paint section .api makes good aquarium chemicals both for testing as well as keeping the aquarium water itself safe and healthy for the fish .getting one of these for your reptile is a must . the are much safer then heat rocks and the work well with providing heat . be sure to install them under the tank prior to putting your reptile in and like the instructions state don t try to remove once you have placed them on a tank broken wires and all .
they do work . exactly as advertised . hane no fear on buying these . fit the chevy silverado wt tailgate rods .these worked for my jeep grand cherokee . i like how these bulbs will replace any of the three rear lights .hope this helps i bought these for my chevy suburban x . liter . fits great and i m sure the truck is loving them ! ! almost miles on this suburban heck if a truck ! !
this pail is not only good for disposable diapers but cloth diapers as well ! it s great that it doesn t require any special type of bag . you can put in a regular trash bag if you want or you can buy their refill bags . i use it with a pail liner for my cloth diapers .it does a great job of keeping the smells in . the only time i notice a smell is when i m opening it up to throw in a diaper or to change the pail liner .i like this product so much that i recommend it to anyone i know who s having a baby whether they are using disposables or cloth diapers !i would definitely recommend choosing the diaper champ over the diaper genie since you can use regular kitchen trash bags instead of expensive genie refills . definitely reduces the odor just be prepared for the awful smell when you open the top to change the bag ! ! ! and is easy to clean . love it ! ! !this is a must have product for all new moms ! ! ! ! the one thing that sets this product apart from the diaper genie is that this product can use regular garbage bags . . .any garbage bags will fit . the diaper genie needs it s own refill bags in order to work and that s just more money that you don t have to spend . . .this is easy to work and easy to dispose of the dirty diapers . . . .fantastic !
i wanted this for my gallon breeder however it looks like it is putting out to many fine bubbles so i had to tone it down with a control valve . i didn t want the parts of my aquarium covered in aquarium scale too quickly . if you purchase this make sure you get a control valve and a check valve .also make sure you have a big enough air pump to run the thing . should get air pump big enough at least for gallon tankgreat product ! ! !let me start by saying i love maxijet pumps . however these newer ones are now made in china . this may or may not make a difference to some people but here is the issue i came across . i use this pump to feed a reactor for my fishtank . normally i use a ball valve to throttle down the flow to keep my carbon from grinding itself down to powder . with the old style pump this was no problem i could dial it back and it would work as quietly as it did unrestricted . with the new style pump made in china the machining process must be a little more laxed or something as any back pressure at all makes these pumps rattle horribly !be aware of this issue if you plan on using this pump to feed a reactor or skimmer or anything else that might cause some back pressure . the noise will drive you crazy !i borrowed some of the info in this review from another amazon .com customer review on the smaller heater . from what i can see and from what i have read the heaters from this company and it s elite radiant product line appear to be quite similar . unfortunately it s not submersible . i didn t realize not buying submersible would mean needing to reach a water line indicator . it requires the tank to be full to cover the water line indicator not good if you are breeding snails or certain fish because snails to lay their eggs on the tank s glass and could escape easily . the water line indicator also rises above my power filter so i ll never be able to get the water to the height it s asking . the power cord is much shorter than i thought it would be . i had to get an extension cord to plug it in . the picture on the back of the packaging suggests to make a drip loop but the cord is barely long enough to do that and the top of the aquarium is only a couple feet give or take from the socket . very inconvenient . temperature control knob seems really sensitive and even turning the knob a quarter of an inch seems to cause the temperature to shoot up . but as soon as the desired temperature is attained it will maintain .i can t use this thing . waste of money waste of time . i m going to buy a better product . maybe the fluval which got pretty good consistent reviews . that said it does heat the aquarium but the thermostat will not work unless the water is filled to the indicator line which is nearly impossible because you have to overfill your aquarium in order to meet the requirements of this heater . i think a submersible heater would be better for most people s needs .
thicker and make it harder to wean off of for baby .made nice just like the gate . once you put it on there you will forget it s an attachment and just think the gate was made that way .plays nice music that isnt to loud . item is smaller than i expected but that is not a bad thing as it makes it easier for little ones to hold carry .

clipped onto the doorlock and door latch rods securely and installed onto the inner door release handle nice and firm . worked perfectly .no more nagging to close the screen door ! you could probably buy a spring at your local hardware store for about the same price but the pre determined install tension distance to drill holes and where to mount the spring s makes it well worth the . i followed the instructions for screw hole distance and only needed spring . both springs may pull the door past the latch at rest without door swinging closed but a normal entry exit the single spring has enough to overcome the latch without slamming the door .great tool for clamping hard to reach radiator hose clamps . its multi position locking mechanism will make sure to clamp and hold various sized clamps unlike other pliers that can only hold in the fully close position .
we have a lovely sheltie who drives us up the wall with her incessant barking . after trying numerous products and training methods to attempt to teach her to bark one alert bark and stop we finally resorted to using this collar . i really did not want to use a shock collar on my dog ! however this has adjustable settings so we can put it on the lowest setting available . she quickly learned not to bark while wearing the collar . now i just need to fasten something of similar weight to the front of her regular collar to see if that will keep her from barking without actually wearing the shock collar .with two dogs of our own and occasional visiting dogs we ve always had at least two leashes . the flexi leash has outlasted at least three other leashes of various brands going on ten years now .it s a well made product of germany that has withstood the ravages of weather and pulling rambunctious dogs .originally i bought this for our bathroom shy evie so she could have some distance when i took her to the large field across the street . if she was too close to me she wouldn t go unless i turned my back and looked the other way .the leash has two locking mechanisms one that fixes the leash at a certain length and one that is a thumb controlled brake that i use to pull the dog towards me when a car human or another dog approaches us . releasing the thumb returns the leash cord to a flexible mode .in ten years and maybe thousands of walks the leash has never jammed never failed to retract .for wild energetic dogs like our gabby a shorter leash length is advisable . for her i am using a nine foot retractable that gives her a little bit of roaming room but not too much . many dog trainers insist that your dog must walk beside or behind you . i don t subscribe to such restrictions and allow my dogs to explore and enjoy the exciting outdoor scents .with the retractable leash one has the option to keep the leash short when circumstances require more control of the dog .we have two dogs and have had this petsafe wireless containment system and these collars for over years . we are just now replacing a broken collar . the collar broke because it simply got worn out . the collars are worn all day every single day and are only removed at night . the dogs have never ever once left the yard to chase the many types of wildlife that are near our rural property . it s an amazing and reliable fencing system and i have recomended it to many people .
this is wide ruled paper and is easier for grades to form their words on .there are sheets of paper in a pack with drilled holes and fit perfectly in a inch binder .this expandable file is sturdy and well constructed . it is a perfect size for letter size documents . it is not recommended for legal size documents . they are inches long and will have to be folded to fit . use the longer version of the expanding file for those . back to the matter at hand . . .this file will hold hundreds of pages . it seems quite durable and should last quite a while .have you ever had one of those valuable sheets of paper that is used a lot ? it gets ragged someone spills coffee on it . it gets torn . you know what i m talking about .if what is written or printed is never updated or changed it probably should be laminated .if it needs to be updated or finished in the field then a sheet protector is the solution .these wilson jones sheet protectors are transparent . they fit . x sheet perfectly . legal sized paper can be folded to fit and if it is printed on one side the folded portion of the page is visible from the back . these heavy weight protectors are actually a little thinner than some sheet protectors but adequately durable for most applications .they will not tear . they have hole punches on a side flap so they fit in most ring binders . if you need to update the sheet inside it easily slips out the top for the change . for a temporary change you can write on the protector itself with a grease pencil or a dry erase marker .i always keep a supply of these in my office .
this stand is designed to work on electric guitars not acoustic or acoustic electric guitars . the arms that support the guitar are short and not adequate for acoustic guitars . this is however perfect for my lp and sg guitars . i love its size and portability .i have two of these stands the electric guitar bass version and the acoustic version . back to buy a second electric guitar version as a spare or to keep in my guitar case . yes folded up it will fit in my tweed fender electric guitar case alongside the neck of the guitar i do always keep it in the included stand bag to ensure i don t scratch or bump it against my guitar . great at this price too buy several !when my case arrived i feared it was too small to hold my epiphone dot . but this case fits my dot like a glove . the case is sturdy enough to protect my guitar from knocks and dings while the plush inside pampers the guitar s finish . the accessory compartment is large enough to hold my picks tuner and extra strings .
the wilson jones basic round ring view binder is a very nice binder in the world of binders . it has some nice features . for example it is easy to open and close by pressing down on the metal end tabs . the rings come together completely there are no gaps to allow sheets to become damaged when turning them . there are two inside pockets for holding documents they are thin transparent pockets that won t hold much and may tear over time .the covers and spine can be easily customized by visiting wilsonjones .com and following simple directions after searching for the model number w wv one does not have to register to use the free templates therefore one doesn t have to worry about losing one s identity . furthermore the covers are pvc free and are safe for the environment and appropriate for recycling . this binder also comes in a variety of colors .wilson jones however has some nicer binders such as the d ring binders wilson jones heavy duty d ring view binder with extra durable hinge inch white w wpp that hold more paper than the ones with standard round rings . the d ring binders have all the same features except the rings are shaped like the letter d and the edges along the spine are knitted and more durable . nevertheless the wilson jones basic round ring view binder is great for home and office use .joseph b . hoyosi am an educator and documentor who uses vinyl binders extensively . i decided to try avery s durable e z turn ring binder .like many other binders this one has clear pockets on the front and back cover and the outer binding to accomodate identifying sheets . this binder has an interesting oblong shape to the rings . it does make paper management a little easier than the more common circular shaped ring . the binding assembly is riveted to the back cover rather than to the spine of the binder . this does make it easier to manage the page capacity of theis binder .the split rings come together in a pin and socket joint . this is better that the more common angled tooth joint that can permit pages to slip out . . the ring locking mechanism is similar to other binders . it requires a firm pull on steel tabs at the top and bottom of the binder . this is not too bad but there is no positive lock on the rings . if the binder is full of paper and you drop the binder it is very likely the rings will pop open and spill the pages . avery s heavy duty binder has a positive lock that would prevent the rings from popping open .the chipboard that adds rigidity to the covers is made of recycled paper .ths is a minor feature but for me any effort to recycle is a plus .the hinges on this binder don t appear to be any more durable than other binders . this is important to me because i have experienced hinge failures on many binders .when that happens the only thing you can do is throw them out . a heavy duty hinge would be further improvement .the rings on these things are certainly strong and that little peg that sticks out of one side and into the other should prevent that little gap between rings that most binders eventually get . the rings themselves are what avery calls ez turn ring which means it s not as ridiculous as round rings and not as difficult to use turning pages as a d ring . depending on your needs this could be good compared to round ring or bad if you really need the extra capacity of a d ring .for everyday use for classwork this binder should easily do the job . would recommend for frequent use . . .for occasional use avery also makes a heavy duty binder that has the d rings that has more storage .
i ordered two of these one to hold music and one to hold a netbook computer . i am very happy with how it performs in both situations . high quality solid support and good design decisions all around . the angle adjustment is very solid and it should be able to hold a very heavy book of music or a medium sized computer .the arm is just long enough that if turn the platform sideways you can lean the music stand back next to the mic stand that it is attached to . i will try to add pictures when i get a chance .this is really two products that work together a short boom arm with a mic attachment and a narrow music stand that mounts onto a standard microphone thread base . i am using one stand attached to a mic stand and a second with the arm removed mounted directly onto a gibraltar multi mount microphone clamp . major bonus points for making a solid piece of gear that is also modular and flexible .note the music stand easily detaches from the adjustable angle part for storage . this is great but be aware that the lock nut does not do a good job of locking so if you turn the stand upside down the it will fall off . this could be a problem if you experience frequent random gravity fluctuations .final verdict i own two and am considering buying one of the full width mus arm models also .well built . the adjuster end is deeply notched so it can be set for a wide range of angles in about or degree increments . possible positions between upright and horizontal best for setting up drum mics as it would hold position better than a gooseneck . i m using it in a vocal mic application as it pushes the mic a tad further away from the stand to give me a bit more room . but there is no counter weight here so its best used at shallow angles . if i was playing a thicker instrument like an acoustic guitar or if on stage energy has you moving a lot more i would opt for a boom stand instead .perfect for my obscure use .i discarded the mic clip or more so added it to my collection and attached a ram mount to the gooseneck . now i have a universal articulating mount on a flexible post . what to do with it ? i use this contraption to watch movies on my ipod touch on long flights . no more holding a little phone sized thing up to my face for hours on end . this stand and the mount get the small screen right up to my line of vision .
it s easy to install very tough and i love how it looks . it can support quite a bit of weight assuming you properly installed it on a stud and not in drywall and helps with cable management on a rough day .this stand after i finally figured out how to attach it so that it didn t interfere with the boom on my mic stand works okay . due to its heaviness it does hold a good size amount of music however it is short width wise so you can t really get an open notebook to stay in place . at least not with the mic boom there . heavy to travel with also so i don t know how much i ll use it .i use this boom attached to a desk clamp to hold a talk back mic a cheap sm wannabe from radio shack . i like how i can collapse and tilt back the boom so it is out of the way when not in use but then i can easily position for use with a generous inch reach . definitely cannot use this with a standard desk mic stand weighted base because of the tip risk but a clamping mount works very well . the locking clutch is excellent with a large nob and secure teeth . the smaller knob to control extending the boom is also more than sufficient . just what i needed .
i just keep ordering these for my business and hobbies .they are stackable and if you watch your dimensions you can stack different units with different drawers .no they do not come with drawer dividers and they should . the good news is the dividers are relatively cheap to order by mail .this item arrived very fast and was packaged well . these appear to be of good quality and in a size that fills the gap between two sizes i use often . they are dark enough when sealed and the edges appear well sealed . i always take one when i order from a supplier and stretch and pull on it just to see how well it is put together . the adhesive appears quite strong too when you try to pull apart part of the surface it is sealed to comes with it after quite a strong pull . i would say this one passed my simple tests with flying colors and is a great value if you are looking for . x s recommended .i got two of these from my local staples . both were defective . the tabs for opening the top would not work . i actually had to search the internet to find out how they were supposed to open as there were in instructions in the box . these came in the original packaging from m .
i highly recommend these mirrors . i did a lot of looking and comparing before i bought these . i have a toyota tacoma and these things fit well and do a real nice job . they vibrate a little but not excessive . the little bit of vibration i see doesn t interfere with my view . i also do not extend them very far . the further out you go with them the more they will vibrate . just extend to the minimum needed in order to be able to see .before attaching to the vehicle i think it s a good idea to loosen the three screws holding the swivel in place on the bottom of the mirrors and work in a drop of oil . then do not over tighten these screws . they don t have to be very tight to hold the mirror still and not over tightening allows easy adjustment later . if you find they move when you close the door you can tighten a little more but to start off finger tight with the screwdriver is all you need . i also placed a couple drops of oil on the aluminum sliding bar and worked it in before attaching . also when you bolt the mirror onto the aluminum slide bar grip the base the part with the internal threads with a vise grip or something not too tight to crush it then make sure the lock nut is between the bolt and the bar on the bottom and then screw the bolt into the base and through the aluminum slide bar nice and tight without letting the base turn . you ll notice there are teeth on the bottom of the base . these are supposed to sink into the bar as you tighten the bolt . they keep the base from turning when you adjust the mirror . this is another good reason to not overtighten the three screws around the swivel . you want to be able to adjust the mirror from side to side and have it turn only at the swivel and without causing the base to turn against the aluminum slide bar .the bracket will bend the weather stripping on the outside of the window a little . it springs back when the mirror is removed but some of it will be permanent . it s not a big deal and you ll just have to deal with this if you want to use these mirrors . it is not a detriment to the operation of the window .i installed them as far forward as possible so that the top of the bracket was parallel to the ground and the new mirror sits right beside my existing one towards the outside . tightening the ratchet by hand produced plenty of tension to hold it securely . releasing the ratchet is another matter . it s too tight to just push it down with your finger . to release the tension i use a short piece of rope and loop it under the sliding buckle . then i stand right next to the truck with the rope looped around one hand and my other hand on the ratchet release tab . i use my body leverage knees and back to pull upward on the rope a little which takes just enough pressure off the belt to allow me to press the ratchet release tab . you don t need to back the ratchet off very far just enough to get the hook out from under the door . then just close up the bracket and wrap up the belt around it and you re all pre set for the next time .for better stability i advise when you re adjusting the belt place the sliding buckle as necessary so that the crossbar forming the angle is not extended very far if at all . and yes make sure there isn t any dirt behind the buckle or you ll get a scuff mark .you should have the windows all the way down when attaching to the vehicle . the bracket comes close to the window so you need to be careful not to let it scratch the window . after you get the mirror on i advise to raise the window very slowly to make sure that the metal bracket is not contacting scratching the window as you raise it . once you re under way be sure not to lower the window if there is any sand or debris laying on the bracket right next to the window or a scratch may occur from this action also . i ve taken these off and on several times now and we ve travelled with them and i ve been relatively careful and have never had one scratch my window .on my truck the doors fit really well and i can tell the difference when the hook for the mirror strap is hooked under the door . the door fits just a tad more tightly than usual . it has to be closed just a slight bit harder to make the latch engage and when i open the door it pops out ever so slightly because of the extra tension produced by the hook being in there on the bottom . i don t see this as a problem . the mirrors are not on there all the time and even if they were i think the latch mechanism on the toyota is stout enough to handle it without any long term problems developing . just be aware that the hook will slightly change thge way the door latches .the instructions are good too . not the usual loosely translated mandarin . i ve tried to supplement here with my own experience .i bought a pair of these for my grand cherokee . it took a grand total of minutes to install both of them and half of that was spent looking for a screwdriver .if you are at all nervous about trying this here is a overly detailed set of instructions . . open hood . prop it open with something wooden so it doesn t fall on you . . identify the strut on the right side of the hood . . identify the small metal clip at both ends of the strut . if in doubt look at the new ones . you are looking for a metal band about inch in width with two small slots . on the vehicle slide a small screwdriver blade into the clip s slots and twist the screwdriver to pry the clip upward . you can remove it or just loosen it enough that there is a good sized gap between the clip and the strut . . now pull the strut away from the hood body . you may need to slide a screwdriver behind the strut arm to get a little bit of leverage . it is easier to start with the end attached to the hood . . remove both ends of the strut from the vehicle . . attach the new strut . make sure the strut is aligned the same way as the old one with the cylinder at the top of the strut . refer to the opposite strut . just place the socket in the strut over the ball joint on the vehicle and give it a little tap or squeeze with your hand . it should snap right on . . repeat on the other strut .note if it seems like the strut is too big the hood is probably not open all the way . there is no way you are strong enough to compress the strut by hand .i d strongly recommend replacing them in pairs otherwise you will get a twisting motion on your hood . plus if one failed the other one is close behind .that s it you re done .i grew up in the s so i remember well playing with legos . building everying from cars to forts . well the tri lynx comapny has brought us back our nostalic youth with tri lynx levelers . these are large square plastic pads roughly x x thick that are stackable to just about any confgiuration you can imagine . you can stack them in a column fasion for leveling jacks . or you can stack them in an offset alternating brick wall fasion for an interlocking leveler that is safe to drive on without fear of displacement . they can even be stacked side by side for larger duel wheel rvs . for my use i wanted to use them for my leveling jacks and for pads were there was a side leaning tilt . the box says to never stack more than levelers high for a single configuration . i ve gone to under my jacks and they still feel rock solid once pressure is put on them .i m on my th set of lynx levelers . i m convinced you can t have too many . with that i fianlly invested in these stop n chocks wonderful ! ! ! as i said these can be used under your wheels as well . so the stop n chalk stacks as the last piece at the rear of the lynx configuration to allow the driver just back up against them . now these are the most versitle set of leveling chalking pads you can buy becasue they allow for front to rear leveling and side to side leveling . if one side of the coach is lower than the other you can build up just that side and use standard chalks on the other . also if you have enough of the tri lynx levelers you could potentially place say of lift under a front axel on an tandem configuration and or even under a rear . the one draw back is that you would need enough to building this as one continous pad say long or so . but like legos if you have enough your imagination is the limit .a couple of notes you must use these in conjunction with trilynx levelers . they will not work on their own . in addition there is a noctch carved out of the front to force the user to stack in the above mentioned brick wall alternating fasion so that there s no risk of sepertaion between the levels as the rig is driving on or off the pad . also i stongly suggest a spotter ! driving a rig on or off a wide rail is dangerous and having someone to tell you that you a little too close to the edge is a must .
handy . when you go to dump connect the sewer hose to the dump and then hold the end under the cap . slowly loosen the gardern hose cap . if either of your blade valves has leaked or been opened you will have some water here and you will catch it and drain it into your sewer hose instead of all over the ground in front of everyone at the dump station . can also be used for backflushing if you re careful and use backflow preventer .very simple to hook to drainage hose . make sure the one end is secured to the sewer hose rinser and the other hooked into a sewer drain . turn on the water and let the sewer hose get cleared out of any left over debris . this makes cleaning out the drainage hose easy and you stay dry while doing it .this kit makes it super easy to winterize your camper . this way valve will allow you to easily the pump pull from the gallons of pink rv antifreeze . when spring comes around you just need to turn the valve so it pulls from your fresh water tank and flush out the lines with fresh water .
i have bought this filter before . i highly recommend it to all bikers to buy when they need to replace their filters it make the removal and install so much easier to work with due to the nut attached permanently to the bottom of filter . besides its a higher performance over the oem filter . buy it you would love it too .replacing air filters are so easy to do that even a neanderthal could do it . why pay them big bucks ?been using k n filters and this service kit for years . best way to save money on air filters . buy this as soon as you get your car and you will never need another filter again .
i prefer shar s overture premieres which are the same price . these ones are a little too bright in sound and not deep or resonant enough . also bear in mind these are not dominants which are clearly far superior but for which you would be paying a set .not much to say these are your basic hex core nickel plated round wound strings . they are the equivalent ofernie ball slinkys yellow they play nice and feel pretty much the same in my humble non touring musician s opinion .also it s nice that strings are now coming in air tight packaging to keep the fresher and rust free longer . as a note these come packed together in a single bag with color coded washers as opposed to the eb sets that are packed individually in paper sleeves or dr sets that come two to a sleeve . in summary if you re searching for the subtle sonic differences between the brands then you probably aren t reading this review you re out experimenting . for others the lowdown is that these seem like good strings and are definitely worth checking out to see which ones you prefer more .these are perfect but for hybrid projects where more than three knobs are needed i would like to have more individual ones available rather than the restriction of quantity and descriptions contained in the package . i have had to borrow other knobs for other potentiometers which don t match they are functional but aesthetically imbalanced
does what it does and has what it said .works good so far .buy it when you can have compatible staplersworks as advertised . the labels do warp a bit with age but this does not affect how they print or attach .this is an item that does what it says it does . comes in good shape and works well . what more can i say ?
it says this will fit my powerhead from the same company but i seriously just can t figure out how . i have tried every modification possible and have looked at diagrams online and on the directions included and googled and youtubed . nothing . . . so its just sitting in my cabinet waiting for a magical hand to make it fit on there .no assembly flip open and use it . works on my toyota mini van fold up when done and lift using the built in recessed handle on the side . i am a guy and can carry with one hand like buttamy cat has a special cat perch made of wire that i installed one of these doors in so i can also let her go out of the perch to the backyard but can also keep her in when desired . so far it is working great . i have had no trouble with locking and unlocking the door as some people have reported . i ordered a second one for the basement apt . in my house .
i ordered different chargers to maintain my gate opener s deep cycle battery a simple output charger with extension cords for charging other deep cycle batteries from amazonbattery tender dl wh v bank battery management system and this unit has a far superior charging design .the bank battery tender does a simple fast rate charge then switches to a trickle charge at a constant voltage with outputs .this unit pulses the battery under charge and features operating modes with different current outputs for different sized batteries . the selections are motorcycle which also works well for sla gel cells or agm batteries standard automotive starting battery deep cycle batttery and off .what makes the ctek unit special is that it uses a pulse charge in all modes to attempt to desulphate batteries while the battery tender does not . this method of charging has proven successful in restoring lead acid batteries that won t take a charge any more .it comes with a waterproof v output cable and a set of clips or rings for permanent installation under the hood of your car . in addition to the leds for indicating the type of battery being charged a second set is provided for empty full and maintenance pulse charge mode .there is also a noticable increase in quality between the battery tender and this unit small details like a water sealed housing and gaskets on the connectors indicate quality in manufacture .for a single v lead chemistry battery this is a useful well made tool .the battery tender alligator clips allow me to charge a battery without having to install the ring type terminals on the positive and negative posts . i can also charge a battery without having to remove it from a vehicle or removing the cables from the battery . a very handy item to use with my deltran bank charger .i use these for aftermarket batteries for v power wheels . can charge with a battery tender and fit together nicely
i bought this in order to be able to prop heavy books in front of me on a table and also for use as a tabletop music stand on the occasions when i don t use a regular floor music stand .the item is well made of heavy weight wire which is to say round metal rods bent precisely . it folds flat and can be easily stowed either flat or hung from a hook . folded the dimensions are x x . unfolded and ready for action the space between the two holders is . the arms that extend upward to hold the pages in place are . these arms therefore do interfere somewhat with the turning of pages . no easy way round that . the spaces to hold the book are only so you can t put a really thick book on this . that is a drawback as you have to consider the entire thickness of the book not just when you are reading in the middle of it . the illustration which i consider a bit deceptive shows what appears to be a dictionary open to its middle . no way could that happen on this stand with my webster college ! also this device holds the material at quite an erect angle that cannot be adjusted . it seems an appropriate angle though .the stand comes with little rubber tips in a plastic bag so you have to put them on the exposed metal tips yourself no biggie . i do suggest a bit of super glue having lost plenty of these protective tips over time .on paper this copy holder is a great idea and with the m brand you know it is a quality product . this copy holder helps you keep a book in a slanted upright position so that you can refer to it easily . thanks to the extra heavy base it can really be any book including a dictionary . the elastic band keeps the book open and can serve as a line guide . so what s not to like ?it turns out that in everyday use i start to grow tired of it . first it is the size . inch is really big which is great if you need to hold a book open or have two sheets of letter sized paper side by side . but when the holder is empty it s really quite noticeable if left in front of the monitor . fine i will remove it when empty . but the base is heavy and the holder is not easily collapsible . both of these are in fact pros in my mind . there are a cons . the elastic band that holds the book open is not easily adjustable if you only want to use one hand . it also seems that this elastic band is the weakest component and will surely break the earliest . but it s hard to tell how long it will hold .overall i would say that this is great if you need an industrial grade copy holder on a regular basis with regular being the keyword here .prossturdy and somewhat heavy weight .it s going to hold open most books . which is what you want .doesn t cover the bottom of book like some book holders . only a thing band hides the text .quality materials .sits comfortably at desk and holds the book where you can read it .consit s definitely big and a bit deep so get out a measuring tape and visualize the dimensions on your desk . it needs to be as wide as most hardcover textbook cookbooks . unlike some book holders there is no book overhang over the edge due to the design .the bottom hinges are a little weak . like it can too easily fold in on itself . but it hasn t been a problem and can be fixed each time .i wish it did fold up easily and was more easily adjustable .i wish it had an extra band in case this one gets broken or lost .
great case for my epiphone sheraton ii ! if you own a dot sheraton or a you should buy this case ! it comes with a key so you can lock it .sounds a lot more than what you expect this is my nd honeytone one at home one at work . you can use it with batteries or with a v adapter it has a clip to hang it on your belt or wherever you want it also has a headphones input . it gets way to distorted at high volume but come on . . . it s a amp it does what it has to and does it well .i recently purchased a used american fender strat that came with the old tweed case . . .nice case but doesn t provide the protection that i need for my guitars . the fender skb case is built like a tank and provides great protection and it has tsa locks for when you travel . a no brainer for fender guitars .
this product came with the wrong parts and it is unusable without the correct parts . the two plastic parts that make the cross which the cards hang from were incorrect . there are supposed to be two different parts and this one came with two of the same part .this is a great toybox . however pieces came damaged . replacement of the pieces was easy you order it online . the pieces came damaged because not enough protective packaging was used . nonetheless once all the replacement pieces arrived it was easy to assemble .the description and pictures for this product do not match the item i received . i bought these wanting the item showed and described the cups with the white soft spout that come with the valve . i was sent the newer style with the silicone spout with the flip top lid . that is definitely not what i was wanting and i returned them .i do love the avent magic cup it s great . but this isn t it .
after buying generic ink cartridges on line at various ink cartridge suppliers and having to return them because they are dried out i now use hp ink cartridges and think amazon prices are very good . for my hp i buy the rather than the black ink cartridge .way to go amazon !needed ink . bought oem ink . works as advertized . . . fast shipping . will buy more ink when i need it . . .as a computer consultant this is such a pet peeve . printer companies selling printers at megacheap prices so you can be gouged with ink . this has ml of ink in this cartridge . now check out the hp cartridge ml for about the same price . remember it s the same product inside ink .think about it if you buy this cartridge you are getting worth of ink for ish . each new cartridge would be you could have spent on a better printer .
this couldn t be simpler . . .put it at the bottom of your wash bucket and as you rinse the dirt off your sponge mitt brush whatever it sinks to the bottom under the grit guard where it can t get back on your car . i might be paranoid but sometimes i do find quite a bit of dirt and grit near the bottom of my wash water . . .now i don t worry as much about these particles somehow acting like sandpaper against my car s finish .only drawback is that it doesn t fit smaller buckets .definitely recommended to anyone fanatical about keeping the car finish pristine .your wheels typically have a clearcoat and this is sprayed on then using a soft brush you can get all the brake dust off then rinse the wheel . but you can also spray the rest of your car with this . brake dust settles on the lower part of your car s front doors so you can spray these along the bottom . i use my hand with a glove to rub the liquid as i hose it down and it cleans all of the dust and much of the road tar meaning very little use of the abrasive clay that most detailers will resort to for tough spots . this is a less aggressive alternative to clay and should be in every car lover s arsenal .recommended !i just finished my first spring washing when a fellow walked by my car and asked if this was crv that i waswashing . i told him it was almost years old and he could not believe it . i have to admit that the car does look like due to wonderful mothers products and some elbow grease .mothers carnauba wax is one of the weapons in keeping my car looking good .i start by washing my car . i don t dry it as this time as water drops will be removed by other steps . then i clay the car to remove embedded specs stuck on dirt and this year i had rubber marks from clearing the snowmothers california gold clay bar paint saving system . i don t clay every inch of the entire car . i just examine the car by sight for any imperfections and by my running my hand over the paint to feel any tiny bumps . when i feel some grittiness or see some dirt on the paint i generously spray that section with mothers showtime instant detailer then knead the piece of clay in my hand and rub it against the spot i identified . normally you see the dirt disappear in a few swipes . sometimes you need to reapply the detailer and repeat . kneading is important as you want to work the little pieces of dirt into the clay and not leave it on the surface of the clay ball where it can scratch the car . i also use the clay on non painted areas such as glass and chrome if they have stains .after the claying step i wax the car is small sections using carnauba wax . it easy to work with . i put it on a small section each side of the car is done in sections for example by the time i am done spreading it it is ready to be wiped off you don t have to wait . i use micro fiber towels to wipe the wax using a fresh piece of the fiber on each section .as my final step i apply back to blackmothers back to black ozto non painted surfaces . this turns the dull plastic into shiny new looking surface . back to black is also effective in removing any wax that might have accidently got on the plastic that s why i do back to black as the last step .carnauba wax gives a superior shine . it is easy and pleasant to work with . i highly recommend it .
i ve been using stress coat since i ran out of my other water conditioner . stress coat works fine at least the fish look well . the cap can be used to measure out the conditioner but i have a five gallon tank . i change about two quarts of water a week so each batch of water gets five drops . that s been working for me as my fish have lived a few years and they re getting big . one ounce bottle will probably last until they die .if you have anything over a ten gallon aquarium or have multiple aquariums this is for you ! used to take me hours to drain clean and refill my three aquariums . many buckets of water hauled in the process . just did a water change and cleaning in all three aquariums two ten gallons and one fifty five gallon took less than an hour to drain and refill them all . best thing i ever bought ! !great product current removes at least a full cup a week for my gallon reef tank . starts removing waste instantaneously . the configuration is a little tricky though . you will need two air pumps or a dual port pump to run this as well .
it workshighly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering suspension work . you will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover .i hate to use the pickle fork . the pickle fork is the last resort for me as it will damage the balljoint boot .i prefer to use the snap on balljoint remover . if that one cannot fit then i will try this tool . if this tool will not fit then i will resort to a pickle fork .exact replacement from oem . exact fit worked perfect . have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs .
i read all the reviews how using this product . . . on the actual bottle you will find the instructions . . .i used oz per gallon of fresh gas . i didn t have any white smoke from my bike . . .i still need to run the motorcycle more often and see if clean property the dust of my carburetor .i don t have much to say about it . its a filter . don t notice any extra freshness to the air . i had an old filter and it didn t smell so this one doesn t add any extra benefit to me . i ll probably just stick to the cheaper filter next time . definitely change these yourself . do not let your oil change guys do it for you . look up your car on youtube and type is cabin filter replacement . i m sure you ll find a simple step by step video on how to do it yourself . i m guessing you ll save it works well for a few days and after that i have to dump my tank and deposit more bio paks . i just don t know i may be doing something wrong . but i don t think so because i am following the directions on the package . if any one has some tips please post them . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
after a power outage i connected my refrigerator to this power supply . sadly its inverter was unable to support my refrigerator . the duracell dpp hd doesn t have enough momentary output to handle the initial start up current spike of a refrigerator s compressor motor . the specifications say it can momentarily provide up to watts . this equates to amps at v . yet public benchmark figures for a home refrigerator s start up current indicate amps for up to second . other appliances that use electric motors such as sump pumps are likely to exhibit the same characteristics . my suggestion is that customers immediately test this product with any device they intend to power during an outage .some important specifications are missing in the amazon listing . one of the key statics is the capacity of the internal battery which is amp hours at v . this equates to watt hours . yet ac output is much lower than this presumably due to inverter losses . these losses increase with power output . the following table illustrates this . the last column is my calculation .load . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .watts . . . .hours . . . .watt hourscordless telephone . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . portable stereo . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . laptop computer . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . fan . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . tv . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . drill . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . warm air fan heater . . . . . . . . . . . . . . blender . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . hid floodlights . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . observe that the total energy delivered watt hour drops with power consumption . ultimately the usable energy is significantly less than what is contained within the lead acid battery .for reference a refrigerator will use about watts of electricity when the compressor is running . typical consumers will have their refrigerator running about to of the time which equates to an average of watts being consumed continuously .consdoesn t handle current spikes associated with certain electric motorsprosboth ac and dc outputportablesimple operationi ordered different chargers to maintain my gate opener s deep cycle battery a simple output charger with extension cords for charging other deep cycle batteries from amazonbattery tender dl wh v bank battery management system and this unit has a far superior charging design .the bank battery tender does a simple fast rate charge then switches to a trickle charge at a constant voltage with outputs .this unit pulses the battery under charge and features operating modes with different current outputs for different sized batteries . the selections are motorcycle which also works well for sla gel cells or agm batteries standard automotive starting battery deep cycle batttery and off .what makes the ctek unit special is that it uses a pulse charge in all modes to attempt to desulphate batteries while the battery tender does not . this method of charging has proven successful in restoring lead acid batteries that won t take a charge any more .it comes with a waterproof v output cable and a set of clips or rings for permanent installation under the hood of your car . in addition to the leds for indicating the type of battery being charged a second set is provided for empty full and maintenance pulse charge mode .there is also a noticable increase in quality between the battery tender and this unit small details like a water sealed housing and gaskets on the connectors indicate quality in manufacture .for a single v lead chemistry battery this is a useful well made tool .nice high amp current rating on this . i epoxy it to a ah volt gel battery and i can use it as a jumpstarter oremergency power supply for camping or power outages .
i recently purchased this unit to replace an older v tech model . it is loaded with many useful features . overall i m happy but i ve experienced dropped calls while sitting in a chair only feet from the base . there is a short beep and the call vanishes while the handset displays out of range .pros clear sound from the handsets . above average speakerphone clarity . information such as clock cid cw and phonebook entries can be programmed into either the handsets or the base and copied to other units instead of programming each individually . easy to adjust volume control for ringer and calls . can have up to handsets only the base needs to be plugged into the phone line . extra handsets are relatively inexpensive . pairs of handsets can be used as short range walkie talkies . flexible settings for answering machine . it can be set to answer in or rings or not at all . recording time for messages can be or minutes or announce only . messages can be accessed from handsets or base . there are new message indicators flashing leds on handsets and base to alert you to the messages . number speed dial . up to phonebook entries . paging and find handset functions . deluxe call waiting . if a call comes in while you re on the phone a push of a button allows you to let the system ask your caller to hold indicate the line is busy forward the call conference answer and more . room monitering . very useful if there is a child or elderly person in another room and you need to monitor their activities . registering additional handsets to the base is very simple . charge the new handset and simply place it in the base for a few minutes . some other uniden handsets will work with this unit but only the tcx will self register .cons drops calls occasionally lower range than other cordless phones i ve had . people say my voice sometimes sounds fuzzy or stacticky . only the handsets have selection of ringtones or distinctive ring not the base . no battery backup for base unit so the entire system is unusable during a power outage .the pros definately out weigh the cons . i have mobility limitations to having handsets in every room is very useful . it is a keeper so i have decided to order additional handsets as well as a headset .the amazon .com price is higher for the system than some competitors but they have the best price for the tcx accessory handsets especially with free shipping .this ergotron neo flex lcd stand is terrific ! i wanted a stand to rotate my samsung bw lcd monitor to portrait mode since the monitor only comes with a short landscape only stand . all of the rave reviews on amazon are correct . this is the stand to get if you want to rotate a or smaller lcd monitor . i don t know if it can go high enough to rotate a monitor since the corner is a close fit when rotating my monitor .for those wanting a full description of this stand i ll try to describe all of its features .the base is round for a reason . it can rotate horizontally like a lazy susan on bearings ! the base attaches to the vertical stand using two phillips machine screws . the frames are some kind of cast metal so they are very strong . the metal frame is covered with plastic for cosmetic reasons and the finish of the plastic is very nice . the base is . in diameter and is very stable . there is no tippness to the base at all .the stand s mounting plate attaches to the back of the monitor using phillips machine screws or thumbscrews all of which are included . there are two sets of mounting holes in a square pattern . one set is a tad shy of square and the other is a tad shy of square . actually metric measurements i think . the holes lined up perfectly with the screw holes on the back of the bw .the screen can be raised up and down via the spring loaded mounting plate so it is easy to do the height adjustments . there is a screw adjuster to compensate for different weight monitors but the adjustment was about right for the bw out of the box . in either landscape or portrait modes i m able to get the bottom of my monitor about . above the table surface . good for folks who wear bifocal glasses who want their monitors low .the mounting plate pivots degrees clockwise only from landscape to portrait . there are stops at each end so it is easy to rotate degrees without having to play with the rotation . it takes little effort to rotate the screen . when rotating the screen the screen has to be raised to clear the corner over the circular base . then lowered again for comfortable portrait mode viewing . but the spring loaded height adjustment makes the entire process very easy .there is a forward backward tilt adjustment so you can get the surface of the monitor flat to your viewing angle . you can easily turn the monitor like a lazy susan to get the monitor flat to your viewing angle . in a nut shell every conceivable adjustment angle is covered .if you need to rotate your lcd monitor to portrait mode this is the stand to buy . i can t think of any stand that even comes close to this one for the selling price .i installed these on two lcd monitors a viewsonic and dell . the unit is very easy to assemble . you can instantly change the height angle and rotation of the monitors without having to turn any set screws . you just hold the screen and move it to whatever position desired . there are various pieces of hardware supplied to fit many monitor types .
i have this on a green guitar with a green pickguard and black hardware . i think it looks great and i wish i could upload pictures !pretty disappointed in the color . as the review title indicates what i received is more of a black chrome or dingy stainless color . these are simply not going to work with the mots pickguard i purchased them for . perhaps they would blend in better on a black black pearl or tort pickguard .i ordered another package from another vendor and got the same result . perhaps it is a large factory shipment that is bad . some are very dull looking . very disappointing really .the description says the color is gold . it s not . more of a greenish yellow but does what it is intended for . i think i would stick with the black color though .

i purchased this tubing for my gal fish tank with a whisper air pump from here too . i will not have to buy another air pump for years to come . this is more than enough tubing for such a small tank . you could plug the pump in one room and run the hose to another it s so long ! i d say i d buy more but i have about extra feet already and it s so durable i m sure it s not going to have to buy more . great one time purchase !tetra whisper air pump gallonstandard air tubing works does the job . . . bought it to use with a sponge filter and air pump same stuff you buy in stores bought it along with my other itemsi don t know what you could really say bad about it my aquaclear came with a broken impeller so i bought this to replace it . a cool thing i learned was that you can interchange these impellers so you could put an aquaclear impeller inside a aquaclear filter so you have a flower flow . why would you do this ? more bio media more filter media and so on !if you are new to tanks you will soon realize you can never have too much filter if you buy say a aquaclear you will soon find yourself buying a second one so save yourself some time and money and buy the biggest filter you can fit then change the impeller to suit your needs .
same transport box used in pretty much any fish store . works fine as advertised if a little small . the mount is secure tho and attaches easily on my tank or canopy . crazy useful .python comes with an adapter just like this one so you don t need to buy it unless you need a replacement . it is a strong adapter that fits perfectly on my kitchen sink faucet . the python was the best invention since sliced bread and this adapter fits it perfectly .i use the zoo med reptile lamp stand in conjunction with the zoo med mini combo deep dome lamp fixture . it works great and i have had no issues so far over the six months that i have owned it . the bottom of the stand slides right under your reptile terrarium . you can adjust the height of the stand depending on how far or close you want the lamps to your terrarium and it also has places to clamp the lamp cords .
it s double sided tape and it does what double sided tape . . . with one exception . it is stupid strong not sure what stupid strong is but it sounds good and it s not coming off once you put it on .the colors are nice however the ink seeps through and shows through the other side which is pretty annoying on double sided pages .this is the best double sided tape available . i have used many different kinds but this one has them all beat .
these are perfect for treats . . .the shelter plans on beginning a program of training and these will come in very handy .these are great liver treats and the dogs love them . i buy them all the time and will continue to do so !luckily my puppy is food motivated which makes training easier . these are by far his favorite though . he will do anything for one of these !
this mic works great for recording vocals on my mac using garage band . i also wanted to use it on my xbox to play guitar hero and rock band but it s not recognized by either game as a mic . that was surprising since it s a usb mic . it is a tiny mic it ll fit completely on your palm but it can record very loud noises very clearly . it is also very sensitive when set to room recording . excellent product .any product that can make an intermediate level player like me sound like a pro is a sound investment . the rp is an amazing processor loaded with features looper drum machine tuner and dozens of cool pre sets greasr is my favorite . you can customize your own sounds but i still haven t gotten tired of digitech s choices . the ac adaptor included allows for hours of rockin fun . i live in a condo so the headphone jack is essential . i run my ipod through the unit and play along to my favorite tunes sweet ! the control settings can be a little daunting at first but the owner s manual will walk you through the tough stuff . bottom line a great toy .notice in the name guitar input . this is not to be confused with the amplitube irig which achieves input and output through the ipad ios devices headphone jack . headphone connections can be noisy and have reliable connection problems . they also depend on the built in ad da converters in the ipad ios device . this apogee jam k is a professional quality input device that has dedicated a d analogue to digital converter but depends on the built in hardware of the ipad ios device for playback . on the other hand apogee one has both ad and da convertors for both input and output .amplitube irig from ik multimedia has a simple stereo headphone in and out jack plug that plugs into your ipad . the built in hardware in the ipad is something that i love for doing something like watching a movie cozying up to the inch screen but for audio phile quality you need a dedicated a dedicated pre and ad convertor and that is what this apogee jam k has . mind you it has that for audio recording input but playback is handled via your headphone jack on your ipad . you can of course just use that for monitoring your mix and then save the file in a digital format internally and send to a playback device with pristine digital audio quality e .g . saving as a .wav file . this makes the apogee k jam a very usable device to achieve high quality recordings at a very nice price .so here it the continuum . amplitube irig for headphone jack input and output quality built into your ipad etc . the apogee jam k for digital quality conversion on input only with playback being handled by headphone jack on ipad . the apogee one on the other hand at roughly times the price gives you both ad da conversions so it has its own audio output jack plus tracks of recording either instrument and or a balanced external microphone jack . it also comes with a built in condenser mic that is pretty amazing . it also has volt phantom power for using your favorite condenser mic . when you get into the apogee duet and quartet you get more connections plus the all too important option of midi connectivity .
i read in the reviews that this would work on a graco pack n play but it doesn t fit on the side when the napper bassinet insert is in . once my daughter outgrows the bassinet it will be fine and we still use it right now but it will be more useful when it fits . it does fit onto the end but sits at angle due to the curve .these are great to put under a pack n play or on top of a changing table . or even to change baby on the floor or on the go . they are soft absorbent and portable .during those early months it is so nice to have the baby safely sleeping next to you in the co sleeper . it is of good quality and converts into a pack n play when your baby gets more mobile crawling . we use it as a crib still next to our bed even in the pack n play mode . our son loves it still at months old . the attached side pockets of them are great for storing blankets pacifiers burp cloths etc . the only downsides are the same with all pack n plays they are a pain to break down and put back together . after doing it for the th time you get the hang of it but this is the case will all play yards . if you are using this exclusively as a crib for you baby but would also like to go places and take a pack n play i honestly recommend getting a cheap used pack n play for travel so that you dont have to do this with their bed every time you go somewhere . we are very happy with ours and will use it for future babies as well . p .s . purchase pack n play waterproof covers for the mattress to protect it from diaper leaks etc ! 
i really hated to spend the money for a travel system ! it just did not make good sense to me . i was not sure exactly what type of stroller i wanted and decided to wait until after i had baby and then decide ! besides there were irrestible sales on infant car seats too sweet to pass up ! i purchased my infant car seat and got the one i wanted . then found this little contraption ! love it !i was able to keep this in the back of my mini van . it folds flatter than a full stroller and is very light ! there is one latch on the side that keeps it locked together and this is an easy release . it is out of the car open and ready for baby in the car seat .it has a strap that you can thread through the underside of the car seat for protection . it is kind of a pain but once you get the strap adjusted to your seat it is not that bad and definately worth the extra effort in terms of safety .the basket is huge and accommodated my extra super jumbo backpack diaper bag . it will serve you very well for trips to the mall when you have many shopping bags .the wheels turn easily and swivel . you can take this anywhere !the brake mechanism is easy and effective .if you already own an infant car seat in blue this will give you the look of a travel system ! . . .without the price !when luca outgrew his infant car seat i was able to purchase the perfect strollers for him !this is the perfect solution if you do not want to be committed to an entire system and are looking for the flexibility of being able to choose a different stroller down the road .i thought i needed to buy the base separately when i bought my graco snuggleride car seat but you don t . the same base comes with the car seat . you only need this you have two cars with the latch system and don t want to move the base which is not hard to do from car to car . i should also say that you don t need to use any base at all with the carseat the carseat comes with instructions on how to seatbelt in just the carseat carrier part without the base which is what lost of people do in non latch cars anyway althoug the base can be seatbelted into not latch cars too . if you have a latch car it is safer to use the latch system and the base but the carseat can also be seatbelted in just like in the nonlatch cars . latch cars are cars built after .i like the snap n go best out of all the universal car seat carriers strollers .that said my car seat the graco does not truly snap in . it is secure enough for quick trips but i would never want to have to use this as my every day stroller . also i am sure someone else has already posted this but the printed instructions that my snap n go came with had the wrong instructions for attaching the graco . the baby trend web page has the correct directions that you can download . even installed correctly it is not that secure .but i still say this is a necessary product because those car seats are so heave to lug around and this snap n go is so light and stays nicely folded up in the back of the car .the cup holders also get a plus 
my labeling isn t extensive . i m not cutting labels every day . but when i do i want to make neat labels that stay . dymo labeling takes does it in a way very easy to use is economical and stays put . the back peels off easily and application is nice . if i peel them off they come off clean so far without adhesive left behind .the arrowhead erasers are made from a very good quality material . they last and remove pencil marks cleanly and easily .in addition to the traditional use of erasing pencil writing from paper i use the erasers for several other chores . cleaning leathereraser removes minor scuffs from leather shoes handbags and coats . this saved me a lot of money from not having to do professional cleaning . clean off crayon marksa visiting toddler made a drawing on my wall i had trouble removing it until i tried an eraser which worked ! remove scuff marks from wood floorsone pair of my winter slippers leave black marks on my wood floors .an eraser takes them off without damaging the floor . cushion picture framessome of my wall hangings seem to have a mind of their own and keep moving slightly askew . i glued the tips of erasers to the bottom corners of the frames and the picture now don t move hang perfectly and leave no marks on the wall .a have a wall clock on a shiny finish painted wall . the clock would get adhered to the wall for years even though the painting has been done years ago . i glued a tip of erase to the back bottom of the wall clock to create a bit of a space between the back of the clock and the wall problem solved ! remove residue from stick on labelsi use erase to remove the gummy substance on book covers or picture frames left by the price label . this works better than soap and water . eraser just peels them off without damaging the item .arrowhead pink cap eraser is great ! i recommend it .ali julia reviewwe run a four day board gaming event once per year and have a need for our attendees to label an area where they store their games for everyone to play . we have some quality plastic shelving that has very smooth sides . this year for the first time we decided to use these stickers . about of the stickers pulled off without much incident as long as care was taken to pull them off very slowly . even in these cases however there was some glue residue left behind that was difficult to remove . in the rest of the cases some parts of the sticker remained stuck after an initial attempt to remove the sticker as a whole piece . it would then take a thumbnail or other implement to slowly scrape off the remnants . in these cases the glue residue was even more copious . the surface of these shelves are about as good as you can hope for if you want a removable sticker to work . while they certainly proved to be removable we likely won t use them again next year since we spent a significant amount of time removing them and their residue completely .
the sharpie fine permanent markers make a fine black really black line on almost any surface and it s water proof . it will write draw where a pencil or a ball point simply skips over . it s a perfect companion to the sharpie extra fine permanent markers when the line simply isn t bold enough . the only drawback is if you re sloppy in their use . my hand or clothing sometimes have black marks that stay on for a long time except on clothing which doesn t wash out ever !being single i may go to extremes sometimes eg . marking the center bottom of big bed sheets as bottom or marking work paint clothing as shop paint yard . these notations undergo many washings with little if any fading . i even mark all of my tools garden or shop so the honest individuals will make sure and get the tool back to me . these markers will mark on painted surfaces steel aluminum copper etc .the sharpie extra fine permanent markers make a fine black really black line on almost any surface and it s water proof . it will write draw where a pencil or a ball point simply skips over . it s a perfect companion to the fine sharpie when the line simply isn t fine enough . the only drawback is if you re sloppy in their use . my hand or clothing sometimes have black marks that stay on for a long time except on clothing which doesn t wash out ever !being single i may go to extremes sometimes eg . marking the center bottom of big bed sheets as bottom or marking work paint clothing as shop paint yard . these notations undergo many washings with little if any fading . i even mark all of my tools garden or shop so the honest individuals will make sure and get the tool back to me . these markers will mark on painted surfaces steel aluminum copper etc .these earaers don t smear and don t seem to crumble or leave a lot of eraser residue behind which is nice .
a must have to replace oxygen sensors . makes the process so easy that even a caveman can do it . the sensors were in a unreachable spot to use a wrench so this socket really came in handy .i needed to replace the inner tie rod on my corolla . i have a fairly well equiped shop but needed this specialty tool to do the job .this tool allowed me to remove the inner tie rod lock nut with ease . it has several difference sizes of fittings that allow it to be used on other vehicles .this tool paid for itself by me doing the job . it is well made and worth the price .i was hoping to use the clay bar to remove water spots on a new truck but the one provided with this mequiar s kit was worthless for this purpose . the kit does include everything you need to apply the products in the kit which is a plus and probably the reason the kit is so popular .
as a teacher and lecturer i was excited to learn of this remote control for presentation software . note that presentation software really means microsoft powerpoint . the presenter does not work with wordperfect s presentations software i can t comment about its use with other software . before buying this presenter i was tied to a podium as i felt that i needed to be within arm s length of the forward and backward buttons on the computer . however this presenter has a range of feet and includes a laser pointer which allows me to roam around the room . the presenter uses two aaa batteries and the power is controlled by the usb plug that is stored in the pointer itself . storing the usb plug in the pointer turns the pointer off while removing the plug from the pointer turns it on . the usb plug needs to be inserted into a computer and then receives the signal from the presenter pointer to control the presentation . the most complex part of using the device is installing and changing the batteries which is not complex at all . the presenter has a nice rounded contoured shape and is comfortable to hold . using this remote presenter is a truly liberating experience and a benefit to those who use powerpoint for presentations .i ve been using a dymo labelwriter twin turbo for about three years . i accidentally plugged in the wrong type of ac adapter into my usb hub and poof my printer blew out . so i ordered a new one . i can tell you that for a small home office environment and postage printing this printer will do the trick . the latest software synchronizes with your outlook contacts so it is easy breezy to create address labels for those who are in your outlook address book .i just received my replacement and there s a problem with the installation at least for windows . the disk that comes with the printer installs the software addressing stamps but does not install the driver . if you buy this printer and are running windows here s what you need to do go to dymo s website . . . and click on support drivers downloads . from here you can download the latest software and drivers and you ll be good to go . if this is a first time installation don t plug in the usb printer cable until prompted to do so by the software download .so aside from the installation problem this is a printer you can count on for the long haul provided you don t do something stupid like i did and blow it out with an incorrect ac adapter . lol !the targus wireless presenter comes with a carrying pouch usb transceiver device the remote control a single aaa battery and some instructions . the carrying pouch felt extremely cheap and was made of an inexpensive fabric material with a drawstring enclosure . the usb transceiver was automatically detected in xp sp environments within seconds . it will be identified as a . ghz rf keyboard and functions fine in over different pcs and different versions of microsoft powerpoint .the remote control accepts a single aaa battery and as always i use rechargeable nimh batteries since they offer more capacity longer life and the ability to be recharged thousands of times . the only drawback is they have a high self discharge rate resulting in the need for a recharge every months even if you don t use it .the remote control has controls . the on off switch is a slide switch on the side that is concealed to prevent accidental shutoffs . there are buttons to go to the next or previous slide to switch between applications to darken the slide go to a black slide and one for the laser pointer . i verified the remote control functions within feet but it starts to have diminished control at the farther ranges . i am not familiar with any presentation environment where you are feet away from the presentation pc so this is a non issue . the laser pointer isn t terribly bright and is a very small dot . i have my doubts about its effectiveness in a presentation environment .pros it worked properly out of the box on several different computers all running xp sp and different versions of microsoft powerpoint . can use rechargeable nimh batteries to reduce battery costs . it is small enough to throw in a laptop case or backpack but large enough that you can use it comfortably .cons the carrying pouch is very flimsy and cheap . the laser pointer is rather weak but at least you have the option of using it .overall very affordable tool for use at the office or school and gets the job done .
highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering suspension work . you will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover .i hate to use the pickle fork . the pickle fork is the last resort for me as it will damage the balljoint boot .i prefer to use the snap on balljoint remover . if that one cannot fit then i will try this tool . if this tool will not fit then i will resort to a pickle fork .they do work . exactly as advertised . hane no fear on buying these . fit the chevy silverado wt tailgate rods .it works
have used it for several applications besides my maf and will be using it on a regular basis as needed .in the past i have used nylon plugs but they are difficult to remove over time . the drain valve i purchased is installed semi permanently and the drain cock only needs to opened to winterize the water heater .this filter is easy to install but sometimes can be a pain to remove . better filter then the fram or advance filters for sure
this product works as advertised but you should beware . these are right angled and they will not fit in a lot of pedals including the crybaby wah .you have been warned ! ! !the evans pedal patch will work for you great . . it will keep your mass drum head from gettingworn and nasty . . i cheap buy and it works excellent . .this can work but if you already use a guitar stand then it is a waste of money . it will work if you use your guitar next to the a table .
i needed to print index cards to keep membership records for a club of members and i went to a well known chain office supply store to pick up a package which probably would have bee available for the standard cost of . . of all the avery products on the shelves of this story wouldn t you know the only item they do not carry is this one . the sales clerk offered to order a package for me but i said no thank you very much i will order my own from amazon which i did and saved myself about ten bucks in the process . with the prime free shipping i received them in no time and they are all printed and ready for the membership chairperson to do her thing .the printing went very smoothly . i used the avery label preset for the item number and created a page document for printing labels per page and made each page a different color to conserve my ink supply of any particular color as well as to keep working with the cards from being boring . i rear loaded my printer though the cards would probably have fed through the bed just as well but why take chances and they went through like a charm no snags . breaking off the edges and separating the cards was literally a snap . will order again .i received these via the vine program so what could be better than getting something that you use every day ? getting it for free to test and review .these are perfect for addressing and printing return labels on envelopes or printing labels for just about anything . plus they integrate automatically with the labels tool that comes with microsoft word tools letters and mailings envelopes and labels . you even can print one label at a time instead of a whole sheet . just choose the row and position of the desired single label when using the tool .i only wish they were a little less pricey i mean when i have to pay for them myself . still i give kudos to avery for really knowing their stuff and delivering what people want . and yes i would have written the same review even if i had to buy these myself . . . except maybe i would have used an adjective in front of price such as ridiculously high . . . or is that an adverb ?this purchase is such a no brainer . note that amazon only lets you buy one with each order but it can help you make the free shipping threshold . at present these are going for cents versus the cents i paid . you cannot purchase these in the grocery store for that price which is where i usually get them . i go through these notebooks regularly using them for shopping lists and planning events . okay i m getting to the point that at times i have to write things down because i can t remember them otherwise . you say why not post its ? yes i use those too but occasionally the project is much more than a post it can handle . for instance when i go away for one or two weeks there are a number of things i have to remember to do during the seven days before i leave . so i dedicate a page for each day and write down the things that have to be done . similarly thanksgiving is coming up . for the two weeks prior i have a ton of things that need to be done before t day and then each day i check off the things as they are completed . never mind christmas . you get the idea . i don t care about whether there is a particular quality to the paper or whether the perforation is perfect . the pages are torn out as tasks are completed . and yes i have even given them to my grandkids for their school projects with no complaints .
i literally just took this pedal out of the box an hour and a half ago and it has already blown me away . i ve only begun to scratch the surface of what this pedal can do and i ve made funky weird loops of sound bizarre cricket noises long delays that instead of fading out actually get louder with time . i dont know how else to say it if you are looking for a delay pedal you just found it . this thing can do anything .it feels like the iphone of delay pedals to me so far . . . like it can do all this crazy cool stuff . . . but oh yeah it can also just do an echo too . wait you can call people with an iphone ? i could have waited a week or so to really learn everything this pedal can do and write a detailed review of it s performance but i dont feel i have to . it s the latest boss delay pedal . . . what else is there to say ?also with the price range of dollars its a huge bargin compared to other boss pedals that might pull off a similar effect such as the rc or rc xl . granted i know very little about the full capabilities of those pedals but the dd has up to seconds worth of loop play in hold mode . and the hold mode is so much more sophisticated that what i am familiar with . . . since previous to this pedal i have only tampered with the dd .sorry if i m rambling but seriously i m in love with this pedal . perhaps i will post a video demo of some of the weird junk you can do with it at some point .i m reviewing this after spending a couple or so hours trying to get this to work with my behringer xenyx mixer and i finally did after nearly throwing in the towel . turns out i was using my mixer s cd tape switch incorrectly thus getting very poor results or excruciating feedback . i finally went on you tube and found a behringer guy that has a video that s less than minutes in length and he had the unit hooked up to a mixer and computer . just taking a look at the that video made me realize it was something simple i was doing wrong i was over thinking it . once i got it to working correctly i could not believe the results once everything was dialed in correctly including the control on my pc that controlled the recording volume for this unit . so now i m looking forward to doing some real recording with it using audacity as my main recording software . edit i did some recording with this dealie over the weekend and was really really pleased with the results i can hardly wait to do some more recording with this . so to the arrogant salesman who bad mouthed this at a local music chain store and tried to sale me a . lexicon unit i won t be needing that i m quite happy with this little interface thank you very much . and to everyone else don t forget that you can keep this thing hooked up to your pc and use it to simply listen to music on your hard drive and it will sound a lot better than your stock on board sound card . thanks behringer this is a great value ! !not sure that title is good grammar but anyway i have gotten so much use out of my h ! i m a music teacher and i have recorded music classes and performing groups . being able to so easily record a class and then have them listen to themselves has been really eye and ear opening for those kids !it is very easy to use . the various recording quality settings are useful so you can do anything from a high quality record to a more space saving mp setting .you can record stereo from just in front of the unit or you can turn on way all around recording .i ve used mine a lot also just recording myself on various instruments . i often record one part of a duet then play along with it .you can do some editing on the unit but it s easier to download the track and use some software to do it . i have gone direct to disk though just by cutting off a little noise at beginning or end which is some of the editing you can do on the h .there is little to fault with it . it takes a while to rename a track for instance but there again you could do it on your desktop after you download .prior to this i had a sony minidisc recorder which was all right but really was already obsolete by the time i bought it . i finally got tired of messing with discs .i am very glad i got the h .
an excellent little product that everyone should consider . safely and securely allows you to put a set of keys with easy access to you and your family . perfect for families with kids who have a tendency to lose keys .this is a good calculator for those who are taking business classes . this is helpful for those taking introductory courses in accounting and also in finance . you can also use this to check your excel spreadsheet and make sure that your formulas are correct . this can be especially helpful when setting up an amortization table . however if your teacher will allow it you may be better off with a graphing calculator like a ti . you can use the ti s tvm functions to do the same things and it is a little bit easier to learn .another thing to consider for those who will be taking exams is that you will need to master the functions of whatever model calculator will be allowed on the test . while i prefer the ti it may not be allowed in the cpa exam for example .banker s box don t limit yourself to boring old folders . you can store so much more .with your multi layered corrugate with double bottom you can handle heavy loads not just paper but stuffed unicorns little plush ones not the taxidermy kind .your lid makes it easy to get to our stuffed unicorns so why limit yourself to bankers ?oh well your sturdy sides and locks in place lid will keep our unicorns safe . . .unless it floods then we must hope that unicorns can swim .
although the reviews were mixed i was really really hoping this was going to work for me since i live in an apartment and i am the only tenant with a dog . my dog s barking is driving me crazy and i m sure it s annoying my neighbors as well . anyway the lentek arrived today and i plugged it in immediately . the noise emitted did cause my dog to stop barking but the device is so sensitive that the noise was being sent out whether my dog was barking or not . i know this because i initially had it set on audible to make sure it would be activated when my dog barked . it was set on low sensitivity . i don t see how this could be effective if the alarm is going off non stop even when my dog is not barking . . . how is that going to train him not to bark ? i ll be returning this asap .this collar works perfect . it stays perfectly clasped no matter how much my dog shakes her head . best of all it completely stops the barking when she wears it . my dog took to it straight away others though might need some comforting like the manual suggests . i am very satisfied with how this product works . however i have to get batteries already . i have been using it for about months so maybe that s typical depending on how much your dog barks which mine is one .the fence is incredibly inconsistent . it will shock my dog at different distances sometimes it won t shock at all sometimes it will beep sometimes it doesn t beep and only shocks him . it s impossible to train him properly when the fence is not consistent . i also tried this shock collar on my hand and it left my two fingers slightly numb for about hours . this is not as small of a shock as i expected . i saw my dog shaking whenever i was trying to put the collar on him the last time and decided to just return it because it s just that awful .
this binder is of great quality . the d rings are especially impressive opening easily with a lever at the bottom and closing very securely due to a small pin on one side that fits into a depression on the other . this keeps paper from slipping through the crack between the rings with the binder is very full . many binders i have tried to use clear photo storage sheets with will catch on the rings where they divide when turning . not with this binder .two pockets on inside front and back clear insert areas on front and back cover and along spine .if you are tired of stuff falling out of your giant binders this is the one for you .clear cover on the outside inside slips on inside of cover . rings snap open and closed with ease ! perfect for one subject or topic !this is a very cool product made with just three pieces of stainless steel .it folds up into a very small space and holds a small to medium sized book in a near vertical open face position with a certain panache .but if you re working from a very thick book you need a different bookstand . the convenience disappears when you have to be finessing some of the pages of a large book onto the outside of the vertical placeholder and the rest of them on the inside .i like the idea . shame they don t make a large size too .
i purchased this product for my gallon freshwater aquarium . my aquarium had been neglected for some time and the nitrate levels were over ppm gh over and a kh that would hardly ready anything on the test strip . i added an incorrect buffer too much baking soda and shot my ph from . to . kh went to ppm . i need to get these numbers under control .i did several water changes and my gh would only show a slight drop and my kh was not moving . my nitrate levels did decrease with better maintenance of the aquarium .over the course of days i added teaspoons of seachem neutral regulator . the first day the water turned cloudy and this continued for days . on the rd day i added some ap crystal clear water clarifier which caused the parcipitated calcium and magnesium to clump up and be captured by my hob filter aquaclear with pre filter sponge biomax matrix and foam insert . each day the ph started to decrease . ph . .ammonia ppm .nitrate ppm .nitrite ppm .gh ppm .kh ppm .after adding seachem neutral regulator from to teaspoons total and no water changes ph . .ammonia ppm .nitrate ppm .nitrite ppm .gh ppm .kh ppm .seachem neutral regulator softens water neutralizes ammonia nitrate and nitrite . gallon high tank with undergravel filter and an old penguin biowheel upgraded to aquaclear on . aquarium has been operating for just under years . mature angelfish . albino cory catfish . guppies . platies . ghost shrimp .several ramshorn snails .the product does what it says it will do . although i am currently only at a ph of . this product is trying to overcome a carbonate based buffer that wants to keep my ph at a high level . . seachem neutral regulator is a phosphate based buffer and had clearly done its job by reducing the ph gh and kh .i would buy this product again and recommend it to others . please keep in mind that a phosphate based buffer can cause algae growth if planted aquariums . my aquarium is planted but with plants that do well in low light . higher light levels can lead to unwanted algae growth as indicated by the manufacturer .i use this in my freshwater cichlid and catfish aquariums faithfully . it simply is the best option for water conditioning .this is the only product i use in my low tech planted tank and my plants are doing great . i add ml to my heavily planted gallon tank after a water change and my plants show no signs of nutrient deficiency . even overdosing flourish doesn t seem to trigger algae or green water so i have no reservations at all adding it to my fish only aquariums .the ingredients say it contains copper so i wouldn t risk adding it to my shrimp tanks just to be safe although i doubt it contains more copper than my tap water .
i got this for my beagle pup as she cannot stop chewing . i ve purchased nearly every chew toy amazon sells and finally got this . it was too hard for my week old puppy . she check it out mouthed it and never touched it again . maybe when she gets larger . . . .meanwhile my year old son loves dinosaurs and wanted it . so now it s his . he knows he might be able to give it up one day but i don t think i will be able to get it back .i bought this for my golden retriever puppy but i think i ll have to save it until he s at least months old . it is huge . he couldn t really enjoy it yet because it is so big . but it is well made and i know it will be a favorite when the pup gets bigger .this is the best dino out ! i wish i could have picked which one i got but it didn t really matter . my pup loves it and i will probably be getting a new one soon to give the st one a break .
coming with three rolls dispensers this tape pack is great for when you need tape to be accessible in multiple rooms of the house .one of the things i really pay attention to with invisible office tape is the ease in removing it from the dispenser it comes with since i prefer to use my own tape dispenser . these are easy to remove if necessary . just press one of the plastic tabs on the back with your thumb while pulling up on the roll with your other hand .the one negative about this specific tape pack is that each roll contains only yards of tape . the rolls are relatively small lengths of tape . scotch though is a trusted brand and this is an excellent and useful product .when it comes to tape there s nothing else like the scotch brand . unlike other less familiar brands scotch is dependable . this pack of giftwrap tape provides what scotch brand users have come to depend upon a dispenser that dispenses a tape with a satin finish that will virtually disappear when you use it on most gift wrap . it dispenses easily tears off without a hitch and sticks securely no questions asked . you don t have to worry about whether it s going to stick or not . this inch roll pack is perfect to have on hand for christmas .update june would lower the stars if i could . i have discovered that this tape simply will not adhere well to a surface that is not firm and flat such as cardboard . it popped right off padded envelopes . not good . i m sticking to the packaging tape that i buy at costco . i received a sample yard roll of this product for evaluation via the amazon vine program . i was very interested in checking out this tape as i send packages overseas quite frequently .yes this does seem to be good tape albeit a bit on the thin side . yes you can tear it by hand . it splits easily from side to side . yes it is convenient .but . . . and this is a big but does the convenience of being able to tear the tape by hand justify the outrageous price double that of other tear by hand tapes ?on the price for thescotch tear by hand tape . inches x yards pack yard rolls of this tape was . . per roll cents per yard . thescotch tear by hand tape . inches x yards pack was . . per roll cents per yard .compare that tolepage s usps tear by hand tape x inches for . . per roll cents per yard available from amazon .double the price for the two pack seems a bit much . . . .
i have a canon powershot g and a canon s printer . i ve tried all of the canon papers and they all produce excellent output . i had been using mostly the photo paper pro assuming that the most expensive paper produced the best output . however my testing shows that for most photos i actually prefer the output of this matte photo paper . i found that the color of most objects and people looks more natural with the matte paper . best of all this paper is less than the cost of the photo paper pro on a per sheet basis . if you re using one of the canon photo printers you definitely need to try this paper out . i think you ll find the output excellent and the value outstanding .a word on photo quality . using a epson artisan printer with the correct paper will produce better photos than you will get at a typical photo lab . i highly recommend the epson photo papers as they are designed for the epson inks and the epson printers specifically . i tested the epson premium photo paper glossy and epson ultra premium photo paper glossy and recommend both . looking at the same image side by side on the two papers the differences are almost imperceptible . the detail and color are identical under the most careful scrutiny . a few differences emerge under very careful observation the ultra premium paper is slightly heavier paper this adds to its stiffness . when picking up a x photo from the edge there is about half as much bend vs the premium paper . the ultra premium paper has an iso brightness of versus for the premium paper . this makes no difference in color rich areas of photos but in light highlights if you stare long enough you can convince yourself they are brighter in the ultra premium . telling the difference in brightness requires good light identical photos side by side and far too much scrutiny . the premium costs about . cents per x sheet in packs of the ultra premium costs about . cents per x sheet in packs of given the quality differences are almost imperceptible and the price difference is almost double i d recommend the premium for every day use and the ultra premium only if you are entering a photo contest or have money burning a hole in your pocket . photos on the premium paper will be better than you d get at your local walgreens or costco .epson ultra premium photo paper glossy x sheets s i printed with this on my canon pro mkii and was pleased with the results . the print outs do not have as much glare when viewed in off angle lighting compared to canon glossy paper . this would be a star paper but i have also used canon s new luster paper and find it to be superior . the luster paper isn t as bumpy as this paper and has even less gloss . the luster paper is even better at avoiding glare .if canon offered their luster paper in x i d buy that instead of this . but still i m quite happy with this paper and will buy it for any framed photos .
as with all boss roland products the boss fs performs as designed . i purchased it to control both my boss me multi effects pedal and my fender blues jr amp . the a switch in non latching mode allows me to cycle through stored effects banks in my me and the b switch in latching mode allows me engage and disengage the fat overdrive switch on my blues jr amp . everything works exactly as planned . the fs rugged compact fits right into my into me carrying case and easy to use .i read a few reviews where people were complaining about batteries . . .something to complain about . as with most guitar players i don t use batteries in my effects pedals i use an volt ac dc adapter . visual sound offers the one spot ac dc adapter kit that has a volt battery snap connector adapter . i removed the battery cover then using a small rat tail file i carefully cut a notch in the battery cover for the snap connector to pass through . i then put rubber feet purchased at ace hardware on the bottom to allow the snap connector cable . . .battery problem solved .i also use the fs as a sustain pedal for my yamaha ypg portable grand piano and a control for my rc loop station simultaneously . the possibilities are limited only to your imagination . it is somewhat expensive but it is a great product ! ! if you need a duel switch then i highly recommend purchasing the fs .very versatile power supply and much cheaper than others . this is not true isolated outputs but it is quiet and that is what counts . i have the fuel tank chameleon and i end up using this because it fits the needs of the pedals on my board the best mainly because of the ma output . here is a comparison of the jp chameleon and the onespot . i have all three .t rex fuel tank chameleon ma outputs v v maoutput v v maoutput v v ma use or only not bothoutput v ac majoyo sp ma outputs v maoutput dc v maximum output of maoutput dc v maoutput dc v mavisual sound onespot ma v only daisy chain power into pedals not exceeding maok i ve owned of these danelectro amps . for one they are cheap in price loud in output and can be used as external speakers when attached to computers via wired or with purchase of a cheap bluetooth adapter from ebay or amazon . recently i purchased this item on ebay for bluetooth audio music receiver v . wireless stereo adapter for smart phonesnow i can connect to my tablets smartphones and computers and use this amp as a great external bluetooth speaker . plus the battery life is great . try to buy a bt speaker on amazon with this wattage that s cordless and works from battery power and you will spend well over .the included battery is worthless and dies in about minutes . i installed a mah rechargeable v battery ebay and it lasts forever .plus i can still use it as a lower quality jam amp when i want . . . for this price its hard to beat .
this is what these things should cost and this is how they should work . i will be trying this out in a chain of effects as the single power supply so i will report back if it cannot do that . works as expected for to pedal power . enough said .works with a lot of mics and with a little modding it worked with my mxl v g which is all i needed it for .works well with my pc notebook and my macbook pro . sounds good . amazing for the price . good buy . can d go wrong .
the diper depot works well with our prince lionheart whipe warmer . it s ridgid plastic construction makes it a stable platform as compaired to the soft vinyl organizers . my only whish is that the hinges on the lid of the diper dispenser could be made a little sturdier .i was wanting something small and sturdy and this fits the bill ! some of the ones you find at target that are plastic are very flimsy . this has rubber on the footings and on the top and is exactly what i was looking for .these cloth wipes are made of relatively thin material but that actually makes them really easy to wipe up tiny bottom messes . they absorb water to wash very well . not sure they will last quite as long as our thicker fleece cloth wipes however .
my heeler loves this . the plastic nobs on the corners are great and the curve is awesome because in the snow she has a problem getting a grip on her frisbee . seems to be similar fabric as the frisbee and we have played with it at below and fabric is holding up well .edit pup has figured out how to flip it over and push it across the ground . she has undone the stitching now on of these . it is her goal after getting a new one to make it where her nose is under a flap . i would think the stitching would hold up she isn t a large chewer but once she gets one flap seam ripped up she is content and the rest seem to hold up .i use this stake for my pound dog . she s not huge but is strong for her size .the other review that mentions the lead getting caught up in the triangle might be due to the stake being screwed too far into the ground . when enough of it is still sticking above the ground the lead should never be pulled up high enough to wind around the triangle handle and instead will just spin around under it .when screwing into the ground the last couple spins can be a bit tough on the hands . if you have a broom handle or piece of pipe lying around it s easier to just use that for leverage when twisting .does not work for gold barb fry . they swam right out through the vents and became lunch . lost them all . slots way too large for barbs .
like many other people sitting at a desk is awkward for me it seems as if the chair has to be high up to reach the desk resulting in the floor seeming to be too low . i usually end up sitting cross legged or with my feet resting on the chair legs . this foot rest allows foot angles that feel natural and it virtually lifts up the floor ! it has four rubber like pads on the base to help keep it from shifting around and a rubber like top to keep your feet in place . the width is wide enough that many foot positions can be used . right out of the box the one i received was set at the perfect tension so that i can adjust the angle using only my feet resulting in being able to adjust foot rest positions as needed .while it s more functional than decorative in style it looks better in person than in photos and virtually disappears when underneath a desk . the metal is gray and the rubber like sections are black . there s a little m brand sticker on the front left corner but it s easily removed if unwanted .because my current desk has a pull out keyboard tray which extends the depth of the desk space when it s in use it s a bit awkward to move the foot stool back and forth by getting beneath the desk . i need to move it forward when using the desk and back when not using it . without doing this i am unable to push the desk chair underneath the desk . this maybe wouldn t be an issue however with a desk where the keyboard rests atop the main surface .as one of the many office workers looking to avoid the sitting death decried by so many recent studies i ve been on the hunt for a way to lift my keyboard and mouse off the desk so i can stand while working . most laptop stands are too narrow since they re designed for a laptop computer not a full sized keyboard and mouse plus mouse pad . this device while not perfect for the task has come closest .the plastic is lightweight but sturdy and everything comes tucked neatly inside for maximum portability . one side slides off revealing the collapsible legs and some other pieces within . the sliding piece then slides on the opposite side to form the tabletop surprisingly it forms a very stable platform . the legs when fully extended place the table at about hip level which would work nicely for a laptop and compact projector setup . in the lowest position the desk sits about a foot off my desk . this for me works out nicely as a standing configuration .i do wish i could adjust the angle of the top and that the legs collapsed a bit more compactly . and the document holder is too flimsy for me to use . but for the price this has become my new worktop keeping me moving during the day rather than sitting . fuzzy wuzzy s summary highly recommended with warm fuzzies !packaging style appearance excellent fuzzies ratingconstruction build quality excellent fuzzies ratingcompetitive pricing value average not good not bad fuzzies rating positives high build quality with good welds and smooth semi gloss black enamel coating . strong steel tubular legs can support up to pounds . if you use this as a laptop riser stand by placing a laptop on the top shelf the surface is perforated with many holes to allow for great air circulation and heat dissipation . negatives there are no negatives with this product this is an excellent solidly built steel stand that both looks attractive with its uniform semi gloss black enamel coating and can support a large computer display monitor or any other item weighing up to pounds . you can either place this on your desk or on a table or countertop e .g . some people have a computer in their kitchen to organize your computer laptop keyboard display layout better .this monitor stand weighs . pounds and has outer dimensions of . width x . depth x . height . the top shelf has surface dimensions of . width x . depth . the space underneath the shelf is . wide which is the . outer width minus the width of the two tubular legs . the space underneath the shelf has a usable height of . which is the . outer height minus the height of the tubular metal that supports the top shelf .even though this is advertised as a monitor stand i am using this as a laptop stand placing a inch laptop on top of the shelf . my computer desk already has a raised shelf where my two display monitors are positioned and my desk has an adjustable keyboard tray where my keyboard and mouse reside . i have multiple desktop and laptop computers so sometimes i place one laptop underneath this stand s shelf with its lid closed and a vga cable connecting that laptop to a larger monitor and another inch laptop sits on the top shelf of this stand . when placing a laptop on this stand where i use a separate bluetooth keyboard instead of the laptop s own keyboard the stand s perforated metal surface functions like a ventilated platform to help cool the laptop . since many laptops have their fan intake vents located underneath the laptop it is advantageous that this stand s shelf surface is a perforated metal grill to allow for great air circulation all along the bottom of the laptop . most of the other laptop riser stands are either made of flimsy plastic or metal mesh that is too thin with too much flex in the structure .but regardless of whether you need to place a large display monitor a large laptop or other item this stand serves as a simple sturdy and modern looking support .
i wanted to color code my groups of files so i could keep them all in the same drawer not get confused . when i saw these i had to get them just to see if they would work as i had intended . i will be getting more .i always need shipping mailers and the lighter it is the less i pay in postage . these do have their limits as i wouldn t use them for something i was worried about bending but with the right item to ship they re amazing . i can t even imagine how a plastic can be so strong but these are . i m a first time buyer and would buy them again in all sizes . great to have on hand as i ship often .i actually was surprised that this was a disappointment for me ! i purchase a lot of sharpie products and i have always been happy and pleased ! however this product i am not thrilled about much at all . i gave it stars because it is okay i guess but is not what i am used to experiencing with sharpie products . they are more convenient to throw in your purse if you need to . however these highlighters run out very quickly and not as reliable . i had to give them a try since i use other sharpie products but now i have done this and i can honestly say that i will not be ordering or buying these type again . i have had the need and have been exposed to numerous office supplies of all types and brands for the past years and most likely will continue to do so until i no longer can if that time comes . i do like the concept behind this type of marker . however there is quite a bit of room for improvement which i truly do believe will occur . it is just a matter of time .
it is hard to find a printer that lists windows server as a compatible operating system . i tried some other brand printers and the drivers would refuse to install . even though canon support told me that this printer is not officially supported for server i installed the drivers anyway and it works perfect !pros . takes normal batteries . . bright well focused laser . . uses radio frequency communication not ir so you do not need line of sight to the computer . it will go through a wood podium . . works great with apple keynote and microsoft powerpoint . . works great with mac os x windows and linux . . no need to screw around with bluetooth .cons nonedymo s website has a software download for intel power macs this software does not work at all even though the mac sees the dymo sitting on a usb port it cannot print to it after a friendly geek struggled with it for the better part of a hour it finally decided to print labels even the geek does not know what he did to make it print so if it goes down it goes to my physical trash bin get with it dymo macs are taking over the computer world
this is an item that does what it says it does . comes in good shape and works well . what more can i say ?it s nearly all plastic feels cheap but it looks okay from a distance with the exception of the blade itself which appears to be thin steel and the bolts that keep it together . the only assembly needed is attaching the handle just push it in onto the blade assembly .the trimmer features inch and metric rulers a protective guard rail a blade latch hook a largely meaningless year limited warranty you pay for shipping does not cover the blade putting it to the test i found that it does cut photo paper well . the cut is straight and the blade cuts through the paper with no difficulty . because of the guard rail i doubt that you can squeeze more than a few sheets at a time but that s not a big issue for me because i will be cutting photos only and i doubt that i will ever stack more than or sheets at the most .inside the box there s a note that says that swingline is gbc s new name .one almost good comment on the seller . shipping was quick and the item came in perfect condition but the packaging wasn t exactly state of the art . six months update still cuts well so that self sharpening claim on the blade may hold some truth . on the other hand i only cut a couple hundred sheets so i can say it s great for casual use and it could be good for heavier cutting activities .this labeler is simple it does everything a label gun should ! i have labeled so much stuff with this gun index tabs to containers the variable size option and double line features come in handy so you do not use all your tape up !the price of the refill tape cartridges si pretty cheep compared to others .if you just want a simple labeler that does what is suppose to do and doesn t pretend to be anything else then get this one !
each . oz bottle ml treats gallons . directions are drops per gallon or one capful ml for gallons . i prefer this product over another water conditioner because it gives directions to treat each gallon helpful for smaller betta tanks or partial water changes in other small tanks .it says to dose drops per gallon in order to lower the ph but my water dgh dkh needs drops per gallon . i blew through this little . onces in just four water changes . i do recommend this product but maybe you will need a bigger bottle if you have hard water like me .i love this test kit . i have always had to take water to my area petsmart to have my water tested because i just cannot figure out those little cards that you dip in the water to read the levels . throw them all away and buy this kit . it s foolproof and so easy to use .the charts that you compare the water colors too are very clearly marked and you have no mistake in what you are reading . it tells you exactly how many drops to put in how much water and how long to let it set to read it . the bottles contain enough chemicals to do hundreds of tests . each bottle contains fl oz of test liquid and depending on the test you only use about drops per test . i especially like that all the test bottles and glass vials are in a nice compact case so i don t have all these bottles rattling around the drawer that i keep my aquarium stuff in . and when you do empty one the ones you buy in the store are the exact same size so they fit right into the kit for storage .the written instructions are very clear to understand for testing .
i ve had it for almost years now . . not a single problem ! i ve changed my setup like crazy sometimes even the cables had to be twisted in some certain position on a pedalboard . been bent on the edge of the cable right before the connector been pulled normal way and stomped never a single cut offs on the connection .don t worry too much about cables like a sissy bedroom princess guitarists you re using od distortion pedals anyway right ? if you re a purist don t ever use a pedals or even electric guitar . good luck !i ve been using gls cable for years now and i never had a problem with it . they re good quality cable and will go a long way if you will take care of it .was a great problem solver for me but almost exactly one year after getting it the volume died . useless now . i used the line input to tap into an aux feed that got recorded as it came off a live board . for the price i guess i shouldn t complain too much . behringer often means trading price for longevity as the qc seems to be very hit and miss . so now time to decide do i resign myself to replace it every year or get something mo betta ?note this is a low end but still pro audio piece of a equipment . and while it truley doesn t get super loud for people who say it barely does anything volume wise i have to wonder if they are using it with home audio equipment ? if so your signal strength going into the unit is likely well below the dbu line level signal that pro gear offers . subsequently you are boosting a signal that is much lower to begin with . and as a result are getting poor volume plus the added bonus of increased distorion and or floor noise when you do try and crank it up .update well it works some days and not others it seems so a i keep it around for now as i am having more good days than bad days with it lately . can t really see a rhyme of reason to it connections don t seem loose or intermitant or anything like that i just either have good volume or it craps out ? ? ? it is in one permanent location used exacty the same way every time so it s never a matter of a different configuration or using it with different gear .
i use playtex dropins bottles nipples which are larger than average nipples . these nipples do not fit well in the nipple compartment of this dishwasher basket . i can only wash nipples at a time in this basket . the latches to open the different compartments are very snug making it difficult to open them quickly or with only one hand .these cups are nice enough but the lids are not at all durable . within several weeks the nozzle bit was cracked or broken in almost all the lids .the bottles must be assembled the right way to ensure no leaking . i think people are experiencing leaks because of failure to read directions . . . pull the nipple through the white collar and make sure that the little ridge is sitting on top of the collar all the way around . then put the dome cap onto the white collar . take filled bottles and screw the nipple on as one whole assembled unit white collar nipple and clear dome cap twist the dome cap until the white collar locks . do not overtighten . amazing . . .no leaks !when all else fails read the instructions ! all products are made differently .our son is ready to start with nipple we haven t had any problems so far . good luck !
the uniden tcx offers all the same features as the handsets that came with several other multi handset uniden phones . it is a solid phone handset with the . gigahertz frequency ranking as one of this phone s greatest attractions . i have found that i can stray a good distance from the base and it will still function normally . my home and yard are not huge but i still had problems with fading signals with my older phone . i often had to reposition myself if i was outside in order to get my old cordless phone to receive the signal . but with uniden tcx there is no need to reposition myself or the phone . the signal is still clear even when i am standing in the corner of my property .the lcd display on the uniden tcx is nice . it isn t very large but it lights up in an orange color and it shows many bits of information like the date and time the phone number and name of a caller when an incoming call is trying to ring through a battery charge indicator an indicator telling you the number of different caller id s that have come through and an indicator telling you which handset you are using you can program each one with its own number . the lcd contrast and the ring volume can be adjusted on each handset making it customizable per room . you can even change the display to read in english spanish or french .uniden tcx is compatible with many different uniden phone systems . but in order for this expansion handset to work it must first be programmed with your main phone . this requires entering specific code numbers into your main phone s base unit . if you do not program the phone will not work . programming is simple instructions are included for programming into different main phones and it must be completed or the phone will be worthless .there are only a few things about the uniden tcx phone that are deserving of criticism . first it can get a little tedious trying to program new names and numbers and one needs to be careful not to get carried away because it can take a long time to get everything programmed just right using abbreviations is a good idea to speed up the process . second i don t like the flashing red light in the upper left hand corner of each handset . this is a charge indicator that lets you know the phone is charged and ready to go . there is nothing wrong with letting consumers know this but to have a light that continuously flashes can be a tremendous distraction . third the base is small and light and it can easily get knocked off the table or desk on which it rests . fourth i would prefer a plug that didn t have a block attached to it . this makes it easy to grip but it also means the plug has to be inserted a certain way or it will partially cover the electrical outlet directly underneath it .overall in spite of a few inconveniences i am still satisfied with the purchase of my uniden trx handset and i may add another one or two handsets like it in the future . they sell for a reasonable price and they are compatible with many different uniden phones . clear sound slim design and countless features make this auxiliary phone a nice addition to any uniden household in need of extra phone units .many cute features on this phone include being able to program a name with a specific ringer verbal caller id just says the number or unknown caller different screensavers etc . the range on this phone is excellent and i can hear quite clearly from a distance . also being . ghz it won t interfere with wireless routers and wireless cameras . excellent buy !i bought two of these phones at a store in greenville maine while traveling because i was so taken with the idea of a large caller id and large buttons . the phone is really great super easy to dial and you can read the caller id from a few feet away . there are other great features too the speaker phone is incredibly easy to use and very very clear the volume has a graphic display in the caller id also a great thing there is a mute button and also the caller id is easy to scroll and easy to delete calls . you can also flash over from one call to another quickly . this is a great phone and a bargain for . but . . .but the receiver does not fit well into the base unit as others have pointed out repeatedly and you can leave the phone off the hook very easily without knowing it and the alarm tone is so quiet you won t hear it warning you that it is off the hook . for that reason you have to check to be sure it s hung up every time . it s not a big deal but you have to be careful replacing the receiver . it does fit well if you place it carefully and don t bump it . that has unfortunately happened to me several times . i hang up the phone in my office but apparently haven t sat it well in the base and go to my den to use the other phone and find out the other phone isn t hung up . so you have to trek to the other base and hang it up properly . you learn after a few times but still a pain .ge needs to fix this annoying flaw and they ll have one of the best phone bargains on the market . i have to say that based on how much i love the other features of this phone i would buy more of them it is a great phone and while it s only a phone it s nice to have a phone i actually like .if only ge read the amazon reviews and fixed the one flaw .also amazon alert ! have you noticed how many items are priced at . so you miss free shipping by one penny ? you are forced to buy a second item to get the free shipping . hey amazon we spend a lot of money here how about raising the price to and get past this silly game ?by the way if you re into photography check out my latest book exposure photo workshop develop your digital photography talent photo workshop 
i have used the avent ii sterilizer found at other retailers . probably not much difference between the two i have been using the sterilizer for one month since having my twins . it has really been helpful cleaning non avent items breast pump items baby bottles pacifiers etc . it can sterilize in minutes depending on the power of your microwave . you don t have to have this sterilizer but it helps if you want to clean a few items without having to boil water each time or running your dishwasher .it came with two small avent bottles . i m not reviewing the bottles themselves that s another topic . however this is a nice feature so you can try these bottles out to determine if you want to use their bottles or not .what a great idea to be able to turn your bottle into a sealed container . i never used avent bottles for feeding but i have an avent breast pump and would store my milk in the bottles . these were great .if you use avent bottles this is soooo convenient i highly recommend this product i can pump directly to my pes bottles .
use this on my taylor acoustic electric which does not have a built in tuner . love it it hides very nicely on the headstock your audience won t even see it . what else can i say it s accurate it works it clamps on really neatly securely it s a great price it has not marred the finish on my taylor s headstock in any way etc . . . . i d recommend for all your guitars which do not already include a built in tuner . would definitely buy again ! ! !these are so cool that everyone should have at least one of these even if you don t need one ! ! !it ll do for setup work and the price is right . i wouldn t recommend it for live use or for anyone who changes keys every song its too fiddly to adjust and get firmly set . i also wouldn t recommend it for anyone just starting out . a spring clamp type capo would serve better . this one is probably best for somebody who rarely needs to use it and just wants one one hand or to keep in the case as a back up .it works as advertised but be aware it s not for anything freshly painted or any guitar with a nitro finish . it will mess up the finish . nitro is usually used on your more expensive guitars like my gibson les paul for example . it s amazing how many guitar stands can mess up your finish that s a pretty major design flaw . but they just keep making them .anyway it is a nice little stand but be careful . if you have a nice guitar you ll want to cover the padding with some cloth to avoid possible damage .
these have a lower profile and can fit and bend into the places the ones with thick metal ends can t .nothing special here . if you don t like doing the shoelace thing with your acoustic guitar strap and you don t want to bore a hole in the heel then this is a nice compromise . there are slits on both ends of the leather which means you can reverse the button if you don t want the logo on the front of the guitar neck headstock . you could even flip it inside out and have the soft leather side exposed . i subtracted a star because i think the button should be made out of metal instead of plastic .got this to put into my pseudo caster project guitar . love it ! be warned it does not come with springs claw or trem bar . if you order this get the tremolo bar for the mexican model . the threads are smaller on these .if you like to do dive bombs you will need to grind a bevel on a small portion this massive sustain block . it will hit the back of the cavity before getting anywhere near absolute floppiness .last important note . . . make sure you measure your outer pivot screw distance . if it matches spec on this trem all the screw holes will match up .
i used these ngk to replace champion spark plugs and overall a much better spark plug . the champion plugs looked very poorly made with an electrode that looked like it was cut with a cheap cutter while the ngk looked very good . the ngk spark plugs look very high quality and are reasonably priced considering they are iridium . i have used ngk spark plugs in everything from race engines to marine engines to lawnmowers and have never had a problem . while you may pay more than a cheaply made spark plug you will get better starting better performance and much longer spark plug life .to my complete surprise this was not only cheaper than the automotive store ones and less than what toyota charges it actually appears to be identical to the ultra expensive oem filter with lots of pleats . pretty impressive for the price .purolator pureone filters are one of the highest regarded filters . this particular filter is no exception ! it s been very versatile used it on late model honda civic fit cr v and pilot as well as on my goldwing and filters just as good if not better than oem filters . highly recommended !
works just like it needs to . perfect fit for the tailgate on my chevy when the oem clip busted .great fitexact replacement from oem . exact fit worked perfect . have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs .
love these ! they do their job and clean some glass . the only thing i wish is that they had a slimmer profile because if there is something close the the glass you will not be able to clean that glass by that object with this .the suction cup works well to hold the thermometer to the side but the numbers are so small they are hard to read . it is also hard to see the red mercury line because it is extremely thin .bought of these glass thermometers . one of these broke simply from laying it on the counter . then after a few months noticed the bottom was broke on the other thermometers in the aquarium ! there were small peices of broken glass and beads on the bottom of the tank and the hanging thermometers had jagged edges .really am not sure how they broke . the fish like to bump them when searching for food or just swimming around and the bottom of the thermometer hits the aquarium . the big pleco sucks algae of the glass mabe he bumped it . did my best to vacume up the broken glass black beads . made me half sick thinking about the fish swallowing some or getting cut on the jagged thermometer glass .cannot recommend these . from now on we will be using the digital kind . they may be more expensive but worth it to me .this product does the job but i am a little irritated by the cut of the glass being kind of amateurish . one of the glass edges has a small pit and if you look closely you can see that it was cut very coarsely and not smoothed . when i look at the parts involved i would rather just by the plastic hing and the trimable plastic seal on the back and just get my own glass cut . those parts are probably worth dollar . in fact now that i have them i may just get my own glass cut and have features like slightly rounded edges instead of sharp corners
hard to mess up a floating square . it does contain the food .negatives . . . .to me at least the post that attaches it to the side is long . this puts it far from the corner .overall size float size is l x w . pretty large .inside float dimensions are approx . l x w .this ring could be reduced by a third or half . the foam material does support algae and is quite visible unless you keep the water level up to the black trim .i m used to a simple x clear plastic ring with trapped air floats . this type stays in the corner with the surface tension of the water .all in all i ll use it but wouldn t buy another due to the size .these extensions fit very well with the aquaclear filters if you have deep tank and want to be able to draw the water from near the bottom of the aquarium . i cut the strainer section off all but the bottom one to get better flow and to make it easier to clean .i recently put together a low tech gallon planted tank . not wanting to go with a hob or cannister filter this was the perfect fit for the gallon . like others have said it does get pretty loud . i added about inches of clear tubing bought from a local hard ware store . with the end of the tube about inches below the water line this elite sponge filter is silent . i also added an adjustable valve on the airline so i can control the amount of flow on this filter . all in all would buy again .
this item does exactly what it is advertised to do no complaints here . shipped on time no problems with packaging no defects on the item .half the price of the avery or similar products . heavy duty handles the printer well and does what it s supposed to do .this is an item that does what it says it does . comes in good shape and works well . what more can i say ?
good quality wired correctly can t complain . if you use the one spot power adaptor you need to have a couple of these laying around . it s probably not practical but i wish they made more sizes . in one configuration i only need two plugs in another configuration i need three and yet another configuration i need five so i actually bought a few of the fives and cut them off to the length i need .mr miyagi couldn t have said it any better .robust compact unit which i use with a fender rumble . plenty of lead so i can position it where i need it and thank heavens for duct tape .one thing i love about this extension bar is it will fit over the relatively large diameter down tubes on my hi hat stands . i use anon stage microphone inch gooseneckto connect to the bar then i attach either anady dm drum and instrument microphoneor dm microphone . the bar gooseneck arrangement is sturdy enough for that mic model .this also works well for mounting on microphone stands . i use it and a shorter gooseneck to mount the dm for tenor and alto saxophones or a dm for baritones . again it works perfectly for my situations .i always keep a few of these plus various size goosenecks just in case i need to mount an additional microphone and i am short on stands . it s one more tool to make set up less stressful .trust me when you need one and chances are you will if you re a drummer or a sound tech you will thank yourself for having the foresight to purchase it for situations i cited above and those that i have not foreseen .
first of all this was not sold by amazon but a vendor via amazon . i tried to cancel the order a short time after i placed my order because i did not notice it is acrylic not glass . the vendor refused my request to cancel the order . i didn t want to be rude and refuse to accept delivery . i left it sit in the original packaging for months as i was not happy i bought it . iot did not come shipped in a sturdy box but in a cardboard wrap ! i already had aquariums of various sizes in use . i bought a fish that had to be in his own space so i set it up only to find the filter did not work and has never worked since i set it up . i ended up using a large sponge filter como biochemical sponge filter for aquarium fish tank by como and covered the large opening in the back of the cover with mesh . the cat stepped on the top and fell in because a large unattached door comes off very easily and falls into the aquarium when you are opening it .i have one lone cockatiel but i hated watching him play in the flight cage that i had . it really was the right size for one but i wanted a bigger one . when i found this cage i just had to have it . i could not believe it i checked the size times to be sure i was not imagining this .normally cages of this size are hundreds more money that i was not going to do . this one at this price was intriguing to me . there weren t many reviews so i went by my gut .happily i was right this cage is beautiful i ordered it and this came in a very timely manner . i opened the box and could not believe the size as i was putting it together . it was easy to assemble i did it myself the only problem was that a piece was damaged during shipping . i contacted the company and they assured me they will fix the problem right away .before i had time to get upset about it the new part was on my doorstep . this kind of customer service does not happen to often .i subsequently finished putting it together . i got all the toys and branches and perches in places put charlie in it and stepped back to take a look .it took my breath away . this is huge i can safely put another other birds in there and still have room .this cage is not very heavy but for this money is more than any bird s will ever need .i am very happy i decided to purchase this cage it is beautiful and functional . i have small side doors the open with a spring . i have two large one on front and one in back that i can push my whole arm in for cleaning . the wheels work fine and i pull him around when i am doing things in another room they hate to be far away from us so the wheels are a big plus .it come with very large perches and feed cups that are actually dual cups in themselves so it is like getting cups total .on the bottom is a pull out pan that slides right out making it a breeze to clean .there is nothing that i do not like about this cage i am just thrilled with it . i am also thrilled and actually shocked that the customer service was so nice . i will not hesitate buying from them again . . .i ordered these for my water dragon habitat . the package arrived and when i picked it up it made a rattling sound . they had placed the bulb box in a slightly bigger box with absolutely no cushioning at all and no warning on the outside box of fragile contents . one bulb was completely shattered . the other worked . i put it in the fixture while i processed a replacement order because i needed a basking bulb right away . the second box came and nothing was shattered but one of the lights was a total dud and didn t even light up once .the other in that box worked fine . so i put the dud in the box with the shattered one and sent it back for the return and kept the working bulbs . next time i ll go to a local pet store so that i can return a dud right away if it happens and so i don t risk them shattering in transit .
it worksnice product claims not to damage pressure senders seems to be effective if puncture is in the tread . does not claim to work on sidewalls .highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering suspension work . you will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover .i hate to use the pickle fork . the pickle fork is the last resort for me as it will damage the balljoint boot .i prefer to use the snap on balljoint remover . if that one cannot fit then i will try this tool . if this tool will not fit then i will resort to a pickle fork .
it does what it says . my avent bottles are travel ready with these discs .if you have avent bottles these are a must .i bought these discs after my little one moved from the oz bottle to the oz bottles . they allow me to use the smaller bottles to store breast milk formula and water . they work well on my avent natural oz and oz . bottles and can be sterilized in microwave steam bags .this sterilizer did the trick . we used avent bottles and oz and oz . you can get a set of bottles in this thing and it only takes minutes to steam based on voltage of microwave of course . i would recomnd this .
this interface is alright nothing special its for a guy on a budget . you can use it to record your old tapes or records and it will go straight through the interface to your computer via usb . there is pretty much little to no latency and it isn t noticeable . i plan on buying a tascam interface soon for around . and that should make things better for me . i will still use this to record anything on tv or like i said old tapes . the software bundle is pretty much free as you can find everything on the internet they just bundled it together for you which is nice .not sure that title is good grammar but anyway i have gotten so much use out of my h ! i m a music teacher and i have recorded music classes and performing groups . being able to so easily record a class and then have them listen to themselves has been really eye and ear opening for those kids !it is very easy to use . the various recording quality settings are useful so you can do anything from a high quality record to a more space saving mp setting .you can record stereo from just in front of the unit or you can turn on way all around recording .i ve used mine a lot also just recording myself on various instruments . i often record one part of a duet then play along with it .you can do some editing on the unit but it s easier to download the track and use some software to do it . i have gone direct to disk though just by cutting off a little noise at beginning or end which is some of the editing you can do on the h .there is little to fault with it . it takes a while to rename a track for instance but there again you could do it on your desktop after you download .prior to this i had a sony minidisc recorder which was all right but really was already obsolete by the time i bought it . i finally got tired of messing with discs .i am very glad i got the h .i play and teach classical guitar and needed a good digital recorder with which to record myself and my students and also be able to convert to mp format to upload to the internet . i ve recorded several solo pieces and it does pick up the guitar very well including all string squeaks and fret buzzes darn it . so it will force you to clean up your playing a bit . if you are a musician and want a recorder that is very portable and relatively easy to use then this little gadget is quite good . it won t give you recording studio quality but you can clearly hear the deep tones of a classical guitar and no hiss or background noise unless you have big mouthed birds like i do so you re recording is very clear .when i get ready to record i set the gain as described in the manual then set the recorder on my music stand and begin playing . since i bought the g card i can play the piece as many times as i need too in a row without worrying about it running out of memory just as i finally play the piece to my specifications . also if you connect the h to an electrical outlet and not rely on the batteries that is one less worry . your h won t die during recording because the batteries give out .i can t really tell any difference in the recording quality with or without the wind sock that came with it . it sounds the same . i guess if i were a singer i would use it to screen out wind but a guitar doesn t really need it . yes the screen is very small and difficult to read i keep a magnifying glass handy but now i ve pretty much got the button pushing sequences memorized and don t need to use it as often to see the screen . also download a free editing program such as audacity so you can convert your recordings to various formats .i d give it stars if the case was a little more substantial . it seems fragile and i dropped it once but luckily it bounced off my foot which had a big fuzzy house shoe on it so it didn t break . but it might have if i had not broken it s fall . and you will need a longer usb cord . i can t believe the one they sent was so short . but that is a very easy fix and overall this is one nice little tool . and for the price i d buy it again ! update . . i m still using the h zoom on almost a daily basis to record my students playing and my own playing . i still love it it works great and i feel i really purchased a great item .
another one of those seachem products that creates happy and healthy plants . my plants have beefy stems and beautiful leaves .excellent alternative to co injection ! i use this in my planted shrimp tanks with no harm to my inverts ! excellent for keeping algae at bay and promotes healthy plant growth .i dose my planted aquaria with seachem flourish liquid fertilizer once a week used in conjunction with seachem s root plant tabs . the result is lush green plants that look great in contrast to the vivid colors of the tropical fishes i house in my aquariums .any fishkeeper worth his or her salt understands the importance of healthy plants in a freshwater aquarium setting . and seachem s plant tabs and liquid fertilizer are invaluable in helping to keep one s plants healthy .highly recommended !
this seat has worked very well for our month old boy . very easy to use and clean and also easy to remove and replace to allow adults to use the toilet . one caution the splash guard in front will not always catch everything especially if our son is not sitting centered and aligned with it or if he moves around . you ll need to watch out for this and you ll likely have a little spillage from time to time . perhaps the next version can offer an expanded splashguard . i still think this seat is very much worth buying .i got two of these after starting ec with my month old . the potty is a perfect size for a young child baby who is beginning to use the potty . my son can t get on it by himself but can get off . . .his feet touch the floor when he is seated and he is low enough to reach for toys . the one piece design is great for cleaning . other reviews said that they wished bjorn would make a clear potty like this which is why i got white next best thing for seeing when he s done . if you are considering trying ec . . .don t hesitate you will be shocked how readily young children will indicate they need to potty and will use the potty consistently . great quality product for price !i love this tub ! it really does fit baby from newborn on up . i have an exceptionally large boy we just grow em tall in my family ! so i don t think he ll fit in it as long as most kids but for newborns through mo it should work great . he is months now and about the size of an average month old and he is using the toddler side sitting up he already can sit up on his own for the most part . he won t fit in it for way longer but since he s sitting so well that s fine .this is very well constructed and the bump in the middle really helps keep him from sliding around like i ve had trouble with in some tubs .i would definitely suggest this to all new parents !
these are the tennis type balls that come with the original chuckit thrower . they re ok but they don t go the distance or have the mouth appeal of the ultra chuckit ball . my yard is littered with these balls and none of my dogs will play with them only the ultra ball or various planet dog balls . plus according to the whole dog journal these colorful tennis balls are laden with chemicals that aren t healthy for your dog . spend the money on ultra chuckit balls they cost more but last longer fly farther and are easy to clean .this product has been rated by two young labs brothers a golden retriever and a beagle .these are just the right size and are clean when they arrive in the package unlike some that will sometimes have charcoal loose in the package .these treats are loved by my two small dogs .they clean there teeth very well and are economical due too the fact there are fifty to a bag ! ! !
what can you say about seachem but they are the best . all i buy is their products because i can really trust them .honestly i don t know how any aquarium could do without this ultra convenient and easy to use accessory in my handbook it is necessary . like many other reviewers have already stated it is a grand item that actually does what it claims to do in this day age of false advertising to supposedly numb consumers .now if it were to come in a color better suited to being displayed right there on the front window of my fish s world . . . i would buy another one . the one for acrylic aquariums is blue but mine for glass is off white . perhaps i ll dip mine in something mirror finished . and don t sell your company so someone else can make a cheaper crappier product either . well done mag floaters !performing as described another wonder product from the seachem laboratories . you can trust nearly everything they place their name on . i haven t tried all but those i have are good performers and i will be a repeat owner .
these seem well made and are as advertised . heavy yes but the construction seems worth the weight . look at the mfg weight rating . while these seem strong enough for automotive work i would be leery for weight limits over recommendation . i concur with all of the positive reviews .awesome product super comfy handles and will hold almost any weight . i ve had lb friends support their weight on these so they will suffice for almost any application .very sturdy bright color well made . this is what you need in a chock although i cannot find a weight rating .
how can you go wrong with sharpies ? these things write on anything and seem to last forever . having more colors to choose from makes it even better .while i like the way these pens write i don t like how long the ink takes to dry and how freely the ink flows .i make all my greeting cards and i couldn t live without this gadget . it is easy to refill and easy to use . my only gripe is that the refills don t last that long . maybe they will figure out how to put more adhesive on the roll in the future .
nice construction hinge . a couple of scratches but not worth sending back for . a previous review said the walnut color was more cherry . i wanted more cherry so i ordered the walnut . walnut is dark walnut not a cherry color fyi .i just love this whole color scheme . we painted our son s room blue and got every piece to this set . it is just such a nice change from the baby blue with pastel colored bedding sets . it is definitely a little boy s bedding set . some many things match it outside of this collection too because of the blue and red combination . the sheets wash well too which is a nice plus .this is exactly what i wanted ! ! loved the vivid colors and the style and feel of the fabric . perfect size for me .
i could not get through my pregnancy without this pillow . i initially bought the larger u shaped pillow but this one worked better at keeping me from rolling over onto my back . it is a pain to put the cover on after washing it but that wouldn t stop me from buying this product again . i might even keep using it after the baby is born !i had the hardest time getting my son to latch on . the nurses were working with me at every feeding but he just refused to stay latched ! i was so close to quitting . but a nurse had given me one of these and it was amazing ! i didn t have a hard time getting him to latch on and stay on ! he got so use to it that he wouldn t nurse without it .i now use it with my daughter . she was a very sleepy baby and had a hard time latching on in the hospital so i made sure i brought one of these shields with me . after a few weeks i tried nursing her without it and she latched on without the shield just fine ! see girls really are smarter than boys so naa naa boo boo ! i continue to nurse my daughter using the shield because it s just so much easier to get her to latch on under a nursing cover easier in case i m engorged and if she decides she s done and comes off while i m in the middle of a let down we don t have a messy mess because it pools up in the shield for a few seconds giving me time to grab a spit up rag .now that i m around more moms with kids around the same age as mine i ve heard a few of them tell me that if they had known about these nursing shields that they probably would have breastfed their child instead of switching to formula .the cons ?every time i have to deal with this sheet i swear that i hate it with every fiber of my being . the first time i tried to put in on the mattress i was fussing and swearing at it and was sweating my butt off trying to get it hooked on . it is not intuitive at all to snap on the snap bands aren t placed equidistant so you just have to guess at where they should go . in order to snap the opposite side you have to lean over and into the crib or you have to pull it away from the wall . . . all while trying to stick your fingers through the slats to pull the bands through and snap them . once i had the bands hooked where it seemed they should . . .i got to the opposite end and there was no way the bands were hooking it was a few inches too short ! grrrrrrr !at that point sweaty and frustrated i gave up and threw the damn thing at my husband and told him to do it . since then i ve had to do it myself and i still hate it although i am getting better .the pros ?it is nicely waterproof . when the boy spits up or his diaper leaks or he sweats a lot it does not make it through to the mattress . but that said it s not like there s a lot of liquid to worry about .we haven t had any issue with the snaps not staying snapped or the baby getting underneath the sheet .overall ?we are still using this although i am not quite sure why . there has to be another solution that doesn t cause me mental anguish trying to put it on although honestly sheets of any kind are a pita . so i give it three stars but with a warning that it s a pain to put on .
just as it says . easy to install is good quality and functions just as it should . to install all that has to be done is to remove the four screws holding the fuel filler area finish ring in place . the ring does not have to be removed . place the cover in place and use the provided screws to secure the cover . that easy !i ve gotten a few sets of these to cover the heads of my front and rear license plate bolts and i ve had mostly good results from these covers . i reviewed a separate kit that came with the bolts and threaded plastic mounts for your bumper but that did not directly talk about the covers i think who can remember ? . these covers and the clear plastic rings which allow the caps to be held in place are easy to install with the single exception that the holes in the clear plastic rings are almost always a little larger that the diameter of the bolts holding your plate in place . this creates the small problem of a chance to accidently crush the top of the ring as you re tighten each bolt because the ring will sit low on the bolt threads causing the outer portion of the ring which allows the cap to snap and be held in place so that it falls under the back of the bolt head . so you ll need to slip the ring over the bolt head and you get near the end of tightening down the bolt . the only other problem i ve had with these caps is that one cap in one set new split as i was snapping it onto the clear plastic ring . i had extras form an old set so no big deal . i never lost one of these caps from it popping off during driving so they re a great cover and they do come in multiple colors depending on what you re looking for . i recommend this product .oem quality as mentioned made in japan . the only gripe is the oem cap has honda screws that are have washer locks on them to keep them on the cap and thus less likely to drop while removing them . the replacement screws are separate . the cap also comes with a replacement gasket .tip always replace plug wires one at a time from the old cap to the new cap in the same order rotation you pull from .may as well replace the rotor and coil while you are at it beck arnley ignition rotoroem a ignition coil
at the head and foot of the sheet there are snaps that can come completely off .one elastic strap end snaps to the sheet then wraps around the crib rail and snaps back onto the sheet . if you undo both snaps you are left with a loose elastic band . baby could choke on it if you ask me . i liked the product for its ease of use . . but once i noticed the straps could snap completely off . . i stopped using it .we tried several different brands of these carriers before going with the infantino . i actually had my child with me in our huge quot convertible quot carrier and saw a woman with her infant in the infantino . i was sold on sight .plus side the carrier is well suited for infants from birth until about months . they will not be lost in it or too heavily restrained . it works nicely facing in or out which is not true of most other brands . wide straps the whole way around ! most carriers pad the child and then leave very thin abrasive nylon straps to bite into your shoulders and sides . not infantino . the criss cross straps on your back also do a better job of distributing the load than some carriers we tried . cheap ! you could pay a fortune for one of those fancy oversized scandanavian carriers with all the buckles but why ?minus side small size . excellent for months kind of pushing it from . they don t make an identical but larger one so the time factor is limited . burp cloth is a joke tiny and fastened on with small velcro dots . rips off if the kid tugs on it . i tossed the one that came with ours and started using a cloth diaper . also the head hold straps are meant to be under the armpits on older babies but they are not padded no problem for the headrest and poke into the baby s sides if you re not careful .i recommend this to all parents and all friends buying for parents .after buying and returning no fewer than different mirrors for our car this one finally made the cut . it is wide enough to see the entire car seat and baby and fits perfectly on the headrest . the problem is it won t stay in place no matter how tightly you adjust the straps . we wound up having to put two jumbo baby diaper pins into the headrest and secure the straps that way . if you have leather interior this won t be a very appealing option . we re expecting baby soon and will purchase one more of these since they do work well so just make sure you get those pins to go along with it !
i purchased this after reading many favorable reviews online and it seemed like a good unit for the price . after trying to use it i promptly returned it . i do sound for concerts and wanted a recorder to connect to the sound board to record shows . i have used a minidisc recorder to do this but wanted something that would easily inferface with my computer . i tried recording on the h using it s line in jack and recording from a line out or tape out my mackie sound board or my stereo receiver . no matter how i set the levels the recording on the h was very distorted . i played with the record levels and the agc and limiter functions and tried recording from several different audio sources and always got a very distorted signal . i have used my minidisc for the same application for many years and have never had a problem and have always got very clean good quality sound . the problem with my h was that the gain on the mic and line inputs appear to be the same and are meant for a mic level signal which caused any line level signal to overdrive the preamp . recording from the internal mics seems to work fine . i have worked with professional sound equipment for over years and the zoom recorders are the only brand where i have found this problem .the h has a nice menu set up and the instructions are very easy to follow but if you want good line level recordings look for something else . i exchanged this model for an h n and it had the same problem recording a line level signal but not as bad as the h . i finally ended up getting the tascam dr which i am very happy with . it has a few less bells and whistles but appears to overall be a better quality recorder .i purchased this mic to use for screencasts recording what s happening on my pc s screen while i talk about it . i set it up to sit on my desktop approximately away from me and usedcamtasia studio download and a free program called camstudio to test it out . both programs worked well with the mic and did what i d hoped it would do eliminated my need for a clunky wired mic headset .the build quality of the mic seems excellent and the compact design is fantastic ! i love that it comes with its own carrying case and that it can be on a desktop or clipped to a laptop s monitor .kinks in my system muffled audiothe included software cakewalk s music creator le can be installed on one computer . you get days to register it . i installed it and registered it immediately but it would not allow me to put in my registration code saying i wasn t the system administrator . i am and my windows pc says i am but alas it wouldn t work . this software is optional but i decided to install it prior to the microphone per instructions to try it out . eventually i ended up uninstalling it .soon after installing cakewalk i had a pc issue muffled audio recording . no amount of system tweaking seemed to fix it . i was stumped .then i decided to go to the samson site and see if there were updated drivers for the mic . the generic ones installed were from . no luck .i began reading online about muffled audio on windows pcs . somewhere i noticed a name i recognized realtek which was a name associated with my speakers on my pc realtek digital audio . i went to the realtek site and noted updated drivers for windows bit and decided to download and install them . i rebooted my pc and tested out the audio recording once more . much to my delight this solved the muffled audio problem !i did set the bitrate to the highest level for the best sound quality recording . afterwards i tested out the mic using camtasia and camstudio both worked beautifully with the samson go mic !on my desk at a distance of about . this mic pics up my voice perfectly for dictation and screencasts . no hiss hum breath noises or distortion . very clear and with the properly installed drivers for my audio works perfectly with the usb . connection on my powered usb hub .conclusion buy it for great recordingsthis mic is a truly great if it s recognized and properly configured by your system . impressively clear recordings unlike any i ve been able to obtain using aplantronics .audio usb multimedia headsetor the mic on mymicrosoft lifecam cinema p hd webcam black .for the price i don t think you can do better . it s compact has great voice pick up and audio recording clarity . installation issues may occur but updating audio drivers using a powered usb hub connection and tweaking audio settings within the operating system should give you the quality you ve been hoping for at a price that s right .update been using this mic consistently for a couple months and i m liking it . it s a condenser mic and doesn t filter out ambient noise as well as i d like however for an under forty dollar purchase i m still very happy with it . cakewalk never has registered correctly with my system so i uninstalled it . i guess if anything that s been the downside to this purchase .i had read lots of reviews about behringer some people had buzz and noises etc but this is not my case . i m not a professional and i just wanted a good mixer to connect my guitar pedal my tascam dr my mobile as sometimes i use the tascam to record the mobile to reproduce and my guitar to follow .this mixer works great no noise no buzz no nothing but working as expected . great product for entry level and great price for what you get .
it is such a beautiful and stylish frame . i expected smaller size and was gladly surprised that it is a medium size . looks great in a baby room .i know the thing has the dimensions and of course it s going to be small if it holds a x frame . even though i see dimensions i can t see that in my head before it arrives this thing is so itty bitty . maybe great for a cramped desk space other than that it is really nice and super cute !i loved the bright colors . the container is of a decent size perfect for kids but the lids don t fit well .
not prime !made in germany not communist china .good quality . excellent set .prompt shipping . very satisfied .these heavy gauge acid free sheet protectors work great for both archival and convenient working storage of documents of all kinds . i use these for storing quick reference sheets of frequently used codes and formulas . the originals remain clean and are protected from being bent torn damaged etc .
i got two of these for my twin grandsons who are two years old . they function as described and their month old sister can use it too . they were easy to install and fit securely on both my dining room chairs and a standard folding chair . they take up less space than a traditional highchair which makes them easier to use in my home . the trays are smaller than a standard high chair but i don t see that as a problem especially since one tray has a cup holder that s the one we use the most .we used other types of latches such as the ones that you push down and the ones that you squeeze and pull apart . not toddler proof ! we bought these magnet latches to put on our drawers in the kitchen and what a dream ! ! another reviewer suggested two keys . definitely . we only have one and are going to purchase another . small price to pay for security . the thing i like about these is that if your little one is out of the house for the day or they outgrow them meaning they are old enough to be safe around knives and such you can fix them where they don t require the key ! one drawback if you have a double wide or single wide mobile home you will have to do some modifications to your drawers to get them to work . my husband spent an entire evening working on three drawers due to the modifications needing to be made for them to work correctly for our drawers . after it was all done it works perfectly . also a small price to pay for the security of my little angel . do yourself a favor and invest a little money and get these latches ! ! ! !my third son was bigger than average and had no issue sitting on this potty . i don t understand the negative reviews because of the size of the potty for normal potty training i ve never done the baby potty thing . he was two and a half by the time he was potty trained used this potty off and on until he was almost four we ve only one bathroom so he used it in case of emergency ! . this potty beats the one i used for my first two boys by a land slide ! this one has no cracks or crevasses ! the ones with the take out pot some how always get urine under them . yuck ! i love how easy this is to clean . i rinse it out well then wipe it out with a clorox wipe . after all the uses it doesn t smell like urine or excrement at all .i m on here ordering another one for my little girl so i can have two one upstairs and one downstairs . you can not go wrong with this potty !
they do work . exactly as advertised . hane no fear on buying these . fit the chevy silverado wt tailgate rods .works just like it needs to . perfect fit for the tailgate on my chevy when the oem clip busted .perfect fit for rear window on my ford excursion limited . easy to install . no spotting seen or squeaking at all
helps keep our puppy from chewing on baseboards blankets dog bed table chair legs etc . i hear it doesn t work on all dogs but certainly deters our puppy .i have a large lab mix puppy and this size of mat was perfect for it . it is not a super thick bed as some reviews have stated but there s no reason a dog could not sleep on this mat . it provides a bit of cushion and my dog loves it for eating her treats on or when she just wants her own space . she uses it so much that i can t help but think it must be comfy . she even prefers it over the bed sometimes !my three little shih tzu puppies love this bed . they like to drag it around and sleep where it lands . the size of my pups are between pounds . its great for smaller dogs . just a plain simple dog bed that does the job .
this is a great value . i contacted the company for measurements inside the case to see if it would fit an ibanez rg series . it fits perfectly . thank youthis cover does not fit a full size acoustic electric hohner guitar . i measured the whole at but this cover does not even come close to fitting ! it measures in diameter so check your guitar closely !this was perfect i am very happy with the hosa cfs inch right angle fx pedal cable pack !
i ve an optima in my old corvette that has now failed . i ve have read thru their warranty information . it states that the battery must be returned to the selling dealer for warranty service . it cannot be returned to amazon for any reason . therefore my question is this if the battery purchased thru amazon should require warranty service how is this done and by whom ?i have this wiper in my garage ready to install when my other wiper needs to be replaced . i was a little disturbed that the box that the wiper came in was battered but i examined the wiper and it looked ok . i contacted valeo about their warranty and was shocked to hear that i had to deal with the seller amazon for warranty . amazon offers only thirty day returns and by the time i install the wiper the thirty days will be up . i think valeo a well known wiper blade manufacturer should handle the warranty coverage on their products beyond the thirty days offered by amazon . i think amazon agrees .i ordered one of these for my saturn vue . package marked for vue but item did not work . contacted storefront who fullfilled order for amazon and was referred to curt mfg . to obtain return number . then had to contact seller again . got a refund but i purchased a replacement from a local dealer . seller later reported a wrong item number was somehow in the package .
my baby loves this tub . i have one question why on earth would you pay . for this thing when you can buy it from target for . ? ! ? ? my daughter is months old and we have been using this tub since she was months old . love it but would never pay this much for it ! !i must say i m guilty of purchasing anything that has mozart in the name since i love classical music and mozart is my favorite composer . but this is the best toy ever . when i bought it my baby was a newborn so mostly i played with it . but now my baby is seven months old and absolutely adores it . whenever he is fussy i just give him the cube and he forgets his fussiness at once . best toy ever !i bought this as a stocking stuffer for my month old daughter . great colorful and good price . would buy again .
hard to mess up a floating square . it does contain the food .negatives . . . .to me at least the post that attaches it to the side is long . this puts it far from the corner .overall size float size is l x w . pretty large .inside float dimensions are approx . l x w .this ring could be reduced by a third or half . the foam material does support algae and is quite visible unless you keep the water level up to the black trim .i m used to a simple x clear plastic ring with trapped air floats . this type stays in the corner with the surface tension of the water .all in all i ll use it but wouldn t buy another due to the size .they fit my aquaclear . it s a snug fit but they fit . great for extending the intake tube as far down as possible .i have a tall birdcage and this makes a great shelf for my birdbath . it is discrete and fits nicely .
material is good quality and the height on the back is perfect vs the higher ones because our car seats really don t touch the back enough to justify a higher back recommend checking to see if you need a higher or shorter back protector .i dont use the tray top but the bottom part is great in that it fits easily under the table unlike my other high chair which claimed it would work as a booster but couldnt fit under any tables and has a couple of levels to move him down as he grows taller .my only problem with this booster seat is that it will not work beyond the point when the trays are removed and it becomes just a booster seat . my table top is at the standard height but the skirt of the table goes down too far to allow the seat to go under the skirt area . the booster does strip snugly to both dining room and kitchen chairs so there is no safety issues . the top sections of the tray are no longer used as a child can take them off too easily so i just utilize the bottom tray . it is a very economical way to have a high chair equivalency that works well and i would recommend this item for that purpose . it will also work well with a table that does not have a skirt to block it from scooting up to your table .
this fits our crib mattress tightly and keeps our baby from sweating against the vinyl of the crib mattress . we didn t have a mattress pad with our son and he would wake up soaking wet from sweating against the vinyl of the crib mattress . the crib sheet alone wasn t enough to keep him from sweating . this pad is also not too bulky so it doesn t cause a safety concern . just make sure the pad fits tightly on your crib mattress for safety s sake . we have a sealy crown jewel mattress and it fits great on it .the product overall is good . we have a crib that is arched so you have to cut to properly fit to the crib rail .i registered and received this item but returned it because i wanted to possibly use the baby snuggle nest but ultimately had baby sleep in car seat for a while near me and then when in crib she was swaddled and couldnt roll over and as for the incline i purchased the crib wedge that is the width of the crib unlike the smallness of this one which is great when your baby can finally move around in the crib . this basically is one of the many items aimed at the nervous new mom but a waste
it is a really great chair for a toddler . it is super safe even with a wiggly toddler . love it !very good i hope my daughter loves my daughter is too young still use it not very good i was prepared for herthis is a pretty good design and we especially like the high back which makes it possible for babies toddlers to sit unsupported .
this capo will do the job if you can squeeze it open . i m hoping that leaving it on the headstock will lessen the spring tension . it is all i can do to open and place this on the guitar . i cannot do it with one hand .i use this often to record my band s gigs . now if they would make one that will hold a par can so i can turn my extra mic stands into single can lighting racks !it can be an octave divider up to two up or down it can do parallel intervals a la trevor rabin on owner of a lonely heart it can do intelligent harmonies just make sure your guitar is in tune so it can track your playing ! it can do digitech whammy esque divebombs up or down it can do chorus like detuningit can do whammy bar flutter copiesit s a bargainit s very welcome on my pedalboardif it s what you re looking for it s not lexicon it s not tc nor does it profess to be and you know how to use it you really can t go wrong .get one and have fun ! because it s not programmable i m getting another .
hard to mess up a floating square . it does contain the food .negatives . . . .to me at least the post that attaches it to the side is long . this puts it far from the corner .overall size float size is l x w . pretty large .inside float dimensions are approx . l x w .this ring could be reduced by a third or half . the foam material does support algae and is quite visible unless you keep the water level up to the black trim .i m used to a simple x clear plastic ring with trapped air floats . this type stays in the corner with the surface tension of the water .all in all i ll use it but wouldn t buy another due to the size .i bought this version because the eheim version costs almost x as much and this one gets good reviews from folks at plantedtank . to attach it to my eheim intake not i used the elbow and joined the intake pipe to it using a short segment of hose . the black center piece that stick up is the adjuster which opens and closes the lower openings . the more you allow flow through the bottom the less the surface suction will be . also i had to drill a piece of plastic from my canopy to accommodate the height of the adjuster . but in so doing you can increase or decrease the surface skimmer flow on the fly . just remember to keep the top of the surface skimmer clean periodically .previously i had a sponge prefilter on my intake pipe . i could still have one just cut a short piece of foam and slip it over the lower intake .there are some bubbles being entrained into the intake from the surface water being sucked in . this has not been an issue . however those with co injected tanks should understand that outgassing of co will occur from this area . this may not be a problem with intermittent activation turn the center adjuster for a brief period when surface scum accumulates then turn off most of the surface flow once the surface scum is cleared takes about or so .fit my gallon long wide high just right . the two glass pieces came already inserted into the plastic piece that allows the glass to be lifted for feeding . the other extra plastic piece goes onto the rear glass piece in case you have filters in the back and need to cut slots out for them . however i don t use that plastic piece and have a inch and a half space that fits well for my filter and heater . it also comes with an attachable handle that makes it easier to lift the glass .
i love labels or anything that makes life easier . i am very organized both at work and at home . labels make things so much more convenient and quicker .i love these labels . they don t necessarily have to be used with a printer they can be written on . and the reason i say this is because these labels are for laser printers and i have ink jet printers . therefore i can still use these because i can write on them rather than running them through the printer .there are a variety of uses for labels . in addition to addresses files and other office reasons they can be used for jars boxes etc .awesome product .i received this through the amazon vine program . these labels are heavy grade of paper that will completly cover any errors that you might have made on a previous label as long as this label size is the same as your original label . the package contains a link to a format you can use with word that allows you to print labels that conform to the sheets you have .i have a kodak ink printer and i had absolutely no problems feeding the sheets through it . i was able to refeed the sheets easily if i did not use all of the labels the first time .the adhesive on the labels holds well and i have had no problem .i would highly recommend these labels for normal and for corrective labeling .ok i ll admit it i m an office supply junkie always searching for the perfect label perfect file folder perfect mechanical pencil under etc . i jump at the opportunity to review these items so here we are . . .i ve been using these gold foil labels to make some very nice return address labels i don t mail much these days but when i do i like to use nice labels . i ve also used them to make labels to put in books that i loan to friends in the hope that the book will someday find its way back home .they feed perfectly in my hp photosmart inkjet printer . i ve never had a problem of any kind with hang ups misfeeds jamming etc .the size of these is perfect for my use sometimes these address labels can be a tad too small . not these . the size is generous enough that i can include my phone number on my book labels .
this cover does not fit a full size acoustic electric hohner guitar . i measured the whole at but this cover does not even come close to fitting ! it measures in diameter so check your guitar closely !as a lot of epiphone owners have learned cases designed for the gibson es clones won t fit epiphone guitars as the epiphones have a slightly larger headstock . this case however fits my dot custom like a glove . the padding is perfect the top is arched to precisely fit the guitar and the build quality is better than you might expect at this price level .this is a great value . i contacted the company for measurements inside the case to see if it would fit an ibanez rg series . it fits perfectly . thank you
bought these because we were using a medela pump and philips bottles . of course the breast pump and bottle industry can t make it easy for everything to work together . these adapters fit great onto the pump and the philips bottles . don t feel forced to buy all new bottles or a brand new pump just to make your system work !i use it with a set of avent storage bottles many nipple fit on them and my rented medela symphony pump . there are plastic convertors in the kit but i only use . no leaks easy to clean works just like the description claimed .i had this pump on my registry but then was also given a double electric pump medela pump in style all i can say is good thing i had the double pump ! this single electric one just cannot get enough pressure suction whatever . plus even if it did work a single pump means double the pumping time . i know double electric pumps are expensive but beg borrow get your family to go in it as a gift you need it and this single pump is not an adequate substitute for a real pump ! you can even rent a double pump from the hospital or a lactation consultant . just don t bother trying this one .
an excellent glue for crafting and sticking all types of things especially paper to paper . not for kids as it is a fire hazard if used improperly . it is a lasting glue that leaves paper wrinkle free and it is acid free for photo and important document use . items can be removed and moved but it must be done with great care .i do vast amounts of genealogy and past photos news items and such onto record pages . my wife uses this as a hobby glue for many things such as scrapbooking and greeting card making . excellent choice for both . a fantastic feature not available with almost any other glue is the fact that if it squishes out the side of a glued item once it is dry it will rub off with no sign of residue . crafting includes gluing ribbon cloth plastics buttons feathers leather almost anything .very useful for business display pieces needing glue .but since it is not water base test it first on any surface material you are unfamiliar with .items can be glued by applying to one surface and make contact while wet application to both surfaces and attach immediately or both surfaces allow to dry then put into place but be sure of location prior to touching . it will not move easily once the first touch takes place .caution it is highly flammable so do now use around flame spark while smoking etc .most economical of this elmer s brand even better than a larger quantity . the oz jar can qualify for free shipping if the order is above the minimum .i ve tried other brands and always come back to elmer s for rubber cement and white glue .white glue is not wrinkle free .plain all white labels easily peel off the main sheet of labels each and onto wherever you want labeled .if you use them for name badges you can remove the badge label with the backing attached by turning the sheet over easy ! so you can organize lay out individual name badges labels .warning each sheet recommends not to apply to leather suede velvet corduroy silk vinyl or plastic .so keep this in mind if you re using for name tags . not every participant will be wearing cotton . i did try them on paper they ll remove some of the paper on fleece they ll remove some fleece fuzz and on vinyl the label lifted right off .they are sturdy and i appreciate they are not pre printed so that i can type print or design .these boxes were fairly simple to out together and then had a very sturdy feel to them .i placed hardcover books on top of one of these boxes and it held up without a problem .the only negative is that the ink rubbed off onto my skin as i was folding and pressing the flaps into their slots . the tabs need to be pushed down firmly into place in order to achieve full sturdiness so that they will not come out of place .use disposable gloves .
great door stops ribbed on top and bottom . for really large gaps two can be interlocked and hold the door open .long . x and solid .not your typical x box the fellowes boxes are heavy have reinforced holes where they are tied shut a plastic pull out handle on one end and the usual holes on both sides for lifting . straight for stacking that xtra length sure is welcomed !perfect for magazines comics documents and easy to fold together .quality storage box . fully double walled sides and bottom and lid short sides single walled on lid s long sides and top flat on the bottom inside and out unlike some cheaper ones i ve used very stackable even when full of files i ve used these to stack eight high full of files comfortable hand holes for carryingthe assembly for the first box may take a minute to get just right if you haven t done it before as the diagrams on the boxes are more hints than instructions but if you make a mistake you just unfold and try again . i had no trouble and once you know how to do it it takes only seconds .assembly notes on the lid there are four long tear out tabs not tear off ! at the corners that you need to fold into place at right angles before folding the lid ends around them . don t miss the four very short tabs on the lid to stick in slots at the end of lid assembly .
quality is really outstanding for the price . sound is clear and crisp . i get a lot of feedback but i guess that it is not because of the microphone .this cable disproves the notion that you get what you pay for . it s quality outweighs its price . let s face it a cable is a cable is a cable . but the quality of these cables can vary greatly . i replaced a lighter cable with this one and i was surprised at the difference in the quality of the sound from my amp . i have an ibanez art series guitar into an ibanez watt amp set up in my home . with nothing changed but the cable there was a significant difference in quality and volume . so much so that i checked with my guitar teacher who said he was not surprised . the quality appears good . the ends are heavy duty and the little bit of hum i had due to the proximity of everything was attenuated to the point where it was inconsequential . i ve seen more expensive cables and this one is so far great .hosa gtr guitar cable ftwhen its about wah effects i m too careful cuz not all brands make it well . when i found this one i can be shure that there is no more wah sound out there crunchy warm and with the clarity of this . . . i prefere vox in wah effects and this its a great choice and its too cheap for the quality you get ! ! happy with this . . . recommended ! ! 
the cat likes to play fetch with little ping pong balls which means a person has to play fetch too .so i tried these and to my surprise he likes these . they don t have to be tossed and he plays with them by himself amusing himself by himself at least long enough for his people to eat lunch .i have two dogs that chew everything for whatever reason they won t even play with it . my sammy wont even play fetch with it . it seems durable but i can t really tell you how it holds up cos they don t play with it .my front yard doesn t have a fence and it is where my kids play . my dog loves to play with them and now he can . this holds nicely and isn t horrible to install in the ground .
i probably should compare it to another to see how accurate it is but i really like how easy it is to use and turns off and on by itself .it may be hard to believe how many trailers get stolen because some thief pulls up hooks up and is gone . with the lock they can t hook up to the trailer . this is a must for travel trailer owners .we bought this for our rv mercedes sprinter chassis and it works great . i can see how many miles are left until an empty tank watch the mpg monitor engine temp and lots of other things . be sure to read the manual for how to calibrate your mileage readings . we mounted the scangauge on our dashboard using the provided velcro strips . that approach was okay but i would like to find a sturdier way to mount it . if you re handy you can mount it on your dash and run the cable through the insides to get to the obdii port . you have the option of having the cable connected to the scangauage either on the right side or out the back . no additional electrical source is needed since the obd port is powered .
this cover does not fit a full size acoustic electric hohner guitar . i measured the whole at but this cover does not even come close to fitting ! it measures in diameter so check your guitar closely !beatiful amazing strap . very soft very confortable sits perfetcly on fender strap lock and looks like my g l custom fender select case . what else so ?this strap works fine on my fender strat . it is reasonably comfortable . i was disappointed in that it does not fit the pegs of my zager acoustic . otherwise it works for a lower priced leather guitar strap .
i bought the bark free on the advice of a friend who said it worked well with her dog . i got it for my terrier as i moved into a new apartment and didn t want to disturb my neighbors . based on the reviews posted here i turned on the audible tone so i could hear what set off the device . being a rather loud sneezer i realized my sneezes set off the device quite a bit . also when i was doing the dishes the pots clanging would set off the device . my dog was aware of the sound and it would limit his barking to maybe barks but then he bark again and his barking was a little less but he was still barking . in the end i decided to return the item as it was too sensitive and a lot of things set it off making the association with the barking and the sound of the device probably hard to tell to my dog . it did condition me to be more aware of my sneezing . . .but i can t really control how many times i sneeze . . .and it s not called the sneeze free human training device .a few thing i don t like about this product the collar loosens and has come off by itself . it may seem like an innovative collar design to have both a buckle and a clasp but it s not . it s a very cheap collar . as another reviewer stated it s worth buying a quality collar to replace the el cheapo one that comes with the device . hey i bought one from the grocery store for dollars that is higher quality . also because it s very important to have a dog bark collar that is snug but not overly tight or too loose a buckle is terrible idea . the holes in the collar are at about inch increments so your most likely not going to get the best fit . buy a collar that allows for a custom fit . other reviewer s mention that the collar repeatedly shocks their dog for no reason at all . i ve also experienced this and it was due to user error . i had my mini aussie sitting in the truck next to me and i was talking in her ear telling her she s a good girl and i saw her head bob as it does when she is getting a static correction . i looked at the collar and the setting was set to test . she was getting shocked each time i talked to her . setting it to off or a regular setting fixed the problem . kind of a design mistake if you ask me . i don t like the thought that i could accidentally leave the device on test while i m in a hurry to get out the door and my dog gets shocked the rest of the day . it s the lowest setting shock but just moving or slight sounds set it off . make sure you don t leave it on test mode . the rfa proprietary batteries . while they are not going to break the bank at for dollars plus shipping it does add up . my first battery was depleted in aprox . weeks of continuous usage . another reviewer briefly mentions that she was able to pry the battery out and replaced it . i have not done this and instead was able to find a company on ebay that mentioned their website rfa i don t want to directly link but you can search for rfa battery holder . disclaimer i have not yet used this product so i can t comment on it . but i can say that it will save me money because it uses the ubiquitous cr watch batteries . shame on pet safe for profiteering on a battery revenue .what i like about the collar seems to work better than my other cheaper pet safe model . i was using a cheaper brand for a while but lost it around the house . fell into the couch cushions ! i still needed a bark collar so i spent a long time reading reviews before i settled on the pdc . i have to say that it has been a night and day change with my dog . she used to herd other dogs and not care about the static correction on the cheaper model but this model has levels of adaptive correction and when it s on of one bark is enough and she quiets down . the collar works from the start and keeps her calm to avoid escalation of her barking . i was about to get kicked out of the place i m living because of her and just today my landlord said she has seen a huge improvement . keep in mind static correction is not a substitute for exercising your dog . your dog may be barking because he she is bored . exercise your dog for at least mins hours a day depending on breed and keep it up . in a few weeks you will see the difference exercise is fun for you and your dog . yes you do have the time . just because it gets dark outside when you come home is no excuse . train your dog to run on a treadmill or buy an led meteorlite ball that lights up the night also sold on amazon and play fetch with your dog in the dark .i gave the product a out of stars due to what i view as shortcomings of the product . however it s better than most of the collars on the market so i would still recommend it .finally if you learned something from my review please click it as being helpful .let me start out my saying that i was always firmly against any kind of shock training product . i only recommend this product to responsible dog owners that will exercise their dogs vigorously on a daily basis and do everything they can to keep their dog fulfilled as nature intended .with that said my beagle pit mutt has quite the howl . let s just say it s distinct . . .he makes lbs dogs jump . i m no cesar millan but i ve tried exercise training games . . .everything i know of and he still barks when triggered by animals and sounds . i used a spray collar on him for a year . dogs have a very strong sense of smell so every time he smelled the collar he knew exactly what was going on . he would cower and become a sad pathetic little dog . as soon as i took it off he would go nuts . he knew when it was on and off and totally played the system and his owners on that one . it was clear that he needed something a bit more encouraging . as soon as i got this collar i read the manual thoroughly . twice . i placed it around his neck and waited . he barked a few times and then it turned into a whine . he got into the bark correction bark correction cycle and i snapped him out of it just like the manual said to and he was just fine . he clearly got the message .there are two things i don t like about this product . the battery . it s a basic watch battery set very firmly in a plastic casing . petsafe should be ashamed of themselves for creating such a rip off battery . . there s no manual setting . i would love to have it on auto when i leave the house and on manual when at home only to snap him out of bad behavior . my dream product would be the field training collar and the bark collar fused into one giving me the dog owner total control of my dog rather the bark collar the machine having control over him .
the gate does not swing back does not close by itself and only the bottom lock worksunfortunately you cannot tell from the picture but this product is not well designed . it projects far out from the wall and cannot accommodate any plugs larger than a two prong meaning non grounded table lamp cord . anything like a power strip laptop cord etc will not even be able to be plugged in because the casing blocks it . in addition the slot to feed the cord through to exit the device is also very small and fits almost none of the electronics in my house . it also sits on top of the outlet cover so there is no way to really secure it tightly and it can rotate a bit .this is a perfect baby proofing tool . the strip cover will cover most standard sized power strips . there is a hole on the side for the power strip to plug into the outlet and a wide opening on top for it to connect to the devices plugged into it . it is really easy to put together just snap shut in places . it is also easy to adjust as there is a button on the side that allows you to slide it between different sizes . overall best power strip cover i ve seen .
i used this on all three of my cats and have not needed to retreat them . i will keep it on hand just in case it is needed .i m pretty happy with it and my dog recognizes it everytime i pick it up . he get s really smart and alert . it hooks on just about anything belt pants robe loop . lol i should have bought the next size up because i can hardly fit my hand in so i grab the training treats with two fingers but that works easily . i do have very wide palms . i didn t discover the locking gadget until i was attacked at the dog park with all the dogs with good noses . it has a little plastic slider that makes the pouch closure airtight . well the dogs quit chasing me once i closed it . at first i used zip lock bags that fit perfectly in the pouch just to keep it clean . however that was unnecessary . it just shakes clean after every use .this product works well . it is easy to program and use . the instructions are clear and easy to interpret . i have had this product for over years and it still is working great . i would like it better if i could actually use slots to feed my dog . the th slot can not be used because that is left open . so it really is only a slot feeder . i have a cat feeder that has a closing cover for the open slot . the cover opens with the first feeding so all slots can be filled . i am hoping future models will solve this problem .
removing spark plugs from the ford modular v s can be exceedingly frustrating especially if you snap a plug in half while trying to remove it . the diameter of this tool steadies your approach down into the depths of the head and prevents you from leaning your tool sideways thereby making in easier to remove the plug in one piece .can place inside the fill tube and walk away didn t come shooting back out against the water pressure . only complaint is that it is a little long where the threaded portion connects with the hose . had to install another rubber gasket to get it to stop leaking .great spark plugs the exact type my motorcycle required . very good quality plugs gap already set appropriately . they all come cylindrical cardboard tube over electrode to protect plugs while in the box . so you have no worries of your box being dropped and cracking your porcelain around the electrode .very clean crisp threads and installed in motorcycle heads with ease .insert tip using a rubber hose approximately long slide it over the top end of plug and use to insert plug into place . if you begin to cross thread during insertion the rubber hose will slip around plug . whereas with a ratchet one might be apt to keep tightening at this point thus ruining the female threads in your cylinder head .chriseastern nc
reads the temp in c or f and seems accurate .it does what it is meant to do and does it very welldoes not remove or transform nitrates and nitrites . good for preventative use and general upkeep of your glorious tank . yeah .teast kit has glass test tubes ! easy to read number display with limit water line on glass tube . accurate test colors that matches color chart inside kit and has a booklet that show you exactly what to do . extra details that are necessary are included to buy other chemicals ! kit helped me maintain the water in top shape .
i like everything about this mike except one no gain adjustment on the mike . you have to do it from the software . that was a big disappointment because i had imagined that the knob on the mike was a gain adjustment .of course if you are just recording talk for podcasts you probably won t care . but if you are recording instruments particularly loud instruments you might really want to have gain control as software gain adjustment is not convenient and is actually absent from quite a few recording apps .good tone but dicey controls . like the features especially the noise gate but do not use the scoop very much .it does what s it s suppose to do . . . holds a mic pretty much what you see is what you get . . . works very well .
hmm . . .velcro . . . .comes in a roll . . .cut to size needed . . .sticks great . . .stays on well . . .comes in a few colors . i got clear but the fuzzy part was white so it really defeats the purpose right ?the box can be shipped in small packaging since it just snaps together . the snaps when snapped together does give a very sturdy feel . this does not come with any hanging file folders so be sure to order those as well . i wish the top snapped on somehow .what a clean look for a cork board . it has a smooth light oak frame and plenty of room for pinning . it came with hanging hooks nails but i choose to use the command brand picture hanging strips . wish the board had come with that type of hanging hardware as i dislike the damage hooks nails do to my walls . also if a couple of push pins had been included that would have been nice .it is not a heavy board so it doesn t take heavy hooks hanging strips to put it up . this will definitely keep my papers where i need them .
this is a great value . i contacted the company for measurements inside the case to see if it would fit an ibanez rg series . it fits perfectly . thank youthis cover does not fit a full size acoustic electric hohner guitar . i measured the whole at but this cover does not even come close to fitting ! it measures in diameter so check your guitar closely !see my previous evaluation on a similar product . it is all a matter of how large you want to chord chart to be .
i use this in my lincoln town car signature limited .always use motorcraft in a ford lincoln mercury vehicle .this will last a long time but you don t necessarily need toreplace it every year . fuel filters are best replaced after a certainmileage not necessarily time . if it s a few years old replace itanyway . but if not that old replace after miles sincelast replaced . if neurotic about replacement or don t knowdate of last replacement replace right away or after somelesser interval like miles . but if you believe thefilter might be in serious need do replace it at once .this is a sturdy solid unit but does not include a clip canbuy that separately or your installer can locate it without a lotof fuss .i recently lost a key fob and decided to order two replacements one for my regular key ring and one to just squirrel away with a spare key . that would bring me up to a total of three identical fobs as i have a complete key set for both my truck and my car so it doesn t matter which one i m in . . . i have keys for everything .they don t tell you in the instructions but you have to program all of the identical fobs at the same time with a maximum of three . well i should have still been ok . however no matter how many times i tried one of the new fobs wouldn t program . on the off chance it was just a dead battery i replaced it . no joy .so while you can t beat the price it s a crap shoot as to whether it will work or not . it appears in all respects to be an oem fob .i m not sure how accurate this thing is . i have a new battery but this will show less than v after a few hours with the engine off . it will however show over v after the engine is started . i would assume if it stays consistent that you can tell if there is a problem at some point in the future . i think this is more useful than the factory gauge . i would recommend getting this type of voltage meter if your battery is getting old .
works great nice to have a second cable but the obd end of the cable is angled . in my case this cable won t work on my subaru outback . i would prefer the option of a straight obd connector . note that the angle connector works on my other four cars mazda honda dodge .this is a plastic sandwich type holder for the flat wire connector . not only did my connector fit loose and tilt at an angle as a result but the holder did not have a proper channel to fit the cover for the wire connector i just bought . the channel provided for the cover is very small and is evidently application specific . this was a waste of money . i had to buy a different mounting bracket from a trailer place .the gm bumper connector has its own cap to keep the weather out and so does this adapter . but i really wouldn t leave this adapter plugged in all the time because the gm connector then is not sealed .this adapter fits well with a locating keyway that fits the groove of the gm connector aligning all the pins correctly . it s a tight fit so that it won t fall out in case the cable to your trailer has enough weight to tug on this adapter to any significant degree .i don t have any illumination problems so the led functions are not fully tested . frankly i do a walk around after hooking up anyway with marker lights and flashers on to check that everything works . i presume the leds will tell me if there s an issue some day .
so many teeters are too big and unwieldy for the teething child in question to hold themselves . this is handy and attractive enough that the child can hold it and tends to hold onto it . the different surfaces seem to help too .how fun and awesome ! ! ! got this for my grandson and still can t get over how bright and playful this is . even i want to get in it and play ! the built in activities on the side are the best . the squeaker is a bit hard to press and sure you will have to do for baby . . .but the other toys are super ! it was so so so simple to put up ! ! ! love the bigger size while not being overwhelming . . .those smaller play yards just are too small to be used when you need them most . . .i ve owned the medium large and now extra large version of this blanket . excellent product . i haven t had any problems with the zipper or other components .these blankets tend to be on the large size because they cover a range of about lbs of weight to lbs . for instance . some people seem to have experienced problems with that . definitely pay attention to the sizing and expect a larger blanket . don t worry babies grow into them . a little extra room is good for a growing child .
i used this for painting and it worked perfect was easy to peel off and strong enough to really hold on to the walls . i also used for packaging some boxes and it was extremely strong . a great masking tape !the adhesive is strong but the magnet is weak . i m using it to hold up small notepads to the fridge and had to use several strips to keep them from falling .so i mean it works but it won t go anywhere near as far as i feel it should because you have to use so much to hold things up .i used this product to hang large posters on my workplace walls for a party . it holds well even on textured surfaces and comes off cleanly . best of all i was able to remove the foam tape from the posters without tearing them so i could store gem for use in hue future .
this air gauge is dead on accurate it seals completely allows air to flow the way it should and the two headed chuck fit all cars trucks and even those pesky hard to reach motorcycle valve stems . i own three motorcycles and there is nothing more aggravating than trying to fit a chuck in between rotors fork tubes and tight spaces on a motorcycle . you know what i mean . this two headed angled chuck is angled perfectly to fit over a cycle stem without leaking or having to bend the valve stem . i love it .i have two cars both of which require the large sheet metal self tapping screws to mount the plate to the nylon retainers behind the plate the ones mounted on the car that the screws screw into . problem is that diameter of the plastic ring that holds the screw covers is too small to take the screw s large diameter head . the maximum screw head diameter that will fit the ring is . inch millimeters . option replace the nylon retainers on the car but different cars have different retainers so one must search for new ones that will accept a screw . option try to find self tapping screws with smaller heads . i shopped around for screws with smaller heads to no avail . option grind down the screw head s diameter . option not good on one car i used sheet metal screws that have a smaller diameter but do fit the rings and wrapped the threads with tape . this sort of works but i really can t tighten them down satisfactorily . so i have to check their security now and then . i m leaving the other car as is for now . maybe someone has more practical ideas ? sure would like to hear of them . btw see the update below .update i think i ve found a viable solution to the above problem . i used a sheet metal self tapping screw placed a inch long piece of ordinary shrink tubing i .d . over the threads towards the pointed end of the screw . used a heat gun or you can use a match bic lighter or soldering iron to shrink the tubing which effectively increases the thread diameter to about that of a screw . this allows me to tighten the screw securely and will last much longer than ordinary tape . one more thing the thickness of the screw head doesn t quite allow the chrome cap to fully snap into place over the nylon ring . the top of the head needs to be filed down a little leaving enough philips x to use the screwdriver .i bought this valve with high hopes of simplifying the regular draining of our gal atwood rv water heater as removal of the standard nylon plug is a pain due to its location . if you are looking to purchase this product under the same pretense let me save you the time in my case the better part of an afternoon .first a quick explanation of how the valve works there are actually three components at play the large diameter plug that screws into the water heater a secondary plug that screws into the first and the actual valve which you open and close to drain the water . i believe the intent of this design is to allow regular draining of the water heater with the last smallest valve while removal of the medium nut could be used perhaps at the end of the season to allow more sediment and debris to exit the tank quickly due to the larger diameter . sidenote opening the actual valve the smallest component drains the tank very very slowly and sometimes only at a trickle if you can t get air behind the water in my case i had to open the pressure relief valve in addition to all faucets to produce an acceptable drain rate .while the valve piece never had any issues with leaking the other components did . i tried screwing in these nuts with and without teflon tape and at various depths . no matter what the combination there was always a small leak coming from either of these pieces . there appeared to be no way to practically stop the leaking . i also tried wrapping the nuts with an excess of teflon tape wraps to no avail .i gave up after about hours of tinkering returned the valve to amazon and ended up sticking with the standard nylon plug . hint sears sells a offset wrench that is perfect for removing these plugs .
i am a casual ebayer . i sell old collectibles that i no longer want . i use the paypal or . . . for shipping . these peal and stick labels are made for these sights . you put in the shipping info choose how you want to mail it and a shipping label with postage is printed .i had no problem printing the labels .the only thing two warnings that i would give is first the postage sights default is to have one package per page shipping label and postage on one side and a receipt on the other . thus you are wasting one label per shipment . but on the usps sight you can choose no receipt and then all you have are the shipping labels ! at about cents per label cents per page . this can save a lot of money !second is another plus minus these are heavy duty and if you do not make sure the label is firmly on the package it could catch on something like another package and come off . but if you make sure that it is firmly and smoothly attached that should be avoided .but overall if you use the postage websites and do not do a lot of shipping these make the job easier than printing on plain paper and taping it on the package .our printer is listed on this package however it is cleary the wrong cartridge . ours uses the which is shorter . rather than trust the package check your cartridge prior to ordering . the number is clearly visible .let me say this right off the bat . . . i have never written a review for a product that i haven t used personally but in this case i have made an exception .i wrongly assumed when i requested these labels and dividers that i could print out as many or as few labels as my project required . read the instructions carefully you can only run the one included sheet of through your printer once and if the number that you need is less than you cannot use the sheet again and have to buy either another package with dividers or individual packages of label sheets either sheets of labels each or sheets of labels . the reason they can t be used in the printer again is that the exposed residual adhesive might ruin your printer .i contacted avery s customer service not mentioning amazon or vine and was given the extra label purchase information above .only one sheet of labels comes with this package of dividers . you can print labels to be used on both sides of the index tabs . unless you have a large project where you will be using all labels the others will have to be written on with a pen which is all right if you don t want the uniformity of all of the labels being printed and not hand written . it is not a huge expense but it would then require you to buy additional packages of or labels again using the exact number that you require for your project and throwing away the remainder of the sheet .judging by the pictures only and the info on avery s web site professional results appear to be easily achieved with the printed labels . i have a project that only requires labels and to be truthful i will wait until i have a larger project so i can print and use all labels at the same time .for the . cost i think that they should include more label sheets varying the number of labels on each sheet . maybe several sheets of to .the package as it comes and the purchase of subsequent packages of sheets appears to be for industrial sized jobs assembly line production of multiple reports or for companies individuals who don t mind not having to write in headings on left over unprintable labels .as for the binder that was included in the amazon vine package it appears to be a good buy . it is sturdy and for people with hand problems arthritis etc . the binder ring lever at the bottom of the ring panel opens the rings with ease .
i like this product but it is not as good as i thought it would be .i had visions of it being level with the bed an extension of the bed that i could slide the baby across . instead there is a lip to get the baby over . i am using this as i would use a bassinett it is right next to my bed not attached with the straps but on an angle so i can get in out of my bed . by the time you have your bedside table and the co sleeper alongside your bed there is not much room ! i can reach over and pat him or fish around to replace a dropped pacifier but to get him into my bed i need to sit up and lift him out . the sleeping surface is not level as the base that the mattress sits on is only cloth so it sinks a bit in the middle however i bought it second hand so that may be the reason . i agree with other reviewers that the mattress is hard but i haven t done anything about that because my baby has not been bothered by it but i plan to pad it with a blanket as i have noticed he falls asleep on my bed or his soft changing pad pretty quickly in comparison . it folds up nice and small so i can store it easily until the next baby comes along . it is quite a good size for having beside a bed and it has pockets on the side so if i wanted to move my bedside table out of the way i could put a bottle of water tissues and other bedside table stuff in the pockets . this is only a co sleeper i think the larger version converts into a playpen . i probably should have gotten the larger one for it s versatility later .it is just what i needed to organize my changer table . be aware that this product is not for a crib or a changer dresser or table top . also the edge of the changer table needs to be less than an inch for it to fit properly .when i put these on i was actually really impressed with them they were pretty mesh with the crib sides and didn t stick out badly on a quick glance and make the crib look horrible . however they were on the crib for week before my month old get them off . problem ? the edge of the gummi rail goes down on the inside of the crib rail just enough to sit perfectly where bottom teeth land when chewing . he popped them right off then just chewed on the silicone .
this roll of industrial strength velcro is easy to cut and apply and holds extremely well . not only has the velcro got a strong grip but the glue on the back is also strong . it holds my garage door opener on the motorcycle and there s no worry about it falling off and it also holds inch thick banners and posters on the office wall to avoid making any nail holes in the walls . if you want to remove it simply slide a blade behind it and it will come off . then a little goo gone should remove the glue residue from the surface . it s a reliable hold but doesn t have to be permanent . i always keep a roll of this in stock .when i lived in california i used this product to attach my breakables and wall decor in place in case of an earthquake . nothing ever fell down . . . . .it s great !i ordered this to apply to the back of some fabrics i was assembling to make a fireplace cover for my cold leaky fireplace . i had no doubt that this would stick to the fireplace itself which is metal . i was concerned about the magnetic sticking to the fabric side . for the back of my cover i used thermal drapery lining which is kind of rubbery and nearly waterproof .i applied the magnetic stripping to the back of the cover and left it on my cutting board overnight . this stripping is rolled so the ends of the strips had come up somewhat . i pressed them down again and hung the cover on the fireplace about a week ago . it is still in place . if it does start to peel off the lining i will try some glue on it but hopefully i won t need it .one last thing . this magnetic stripping is heavy duty stuff . depending on your application this may be just what you need .the arrowhead erasers are made from a very good quality material . they last and remove pencil marks cleanly and easily .in addition to the traditional use of erasing pencil writing from paper i use the erasers for several other chores . cleaning leathereraser removes minor scuffs from leather shoes handbags and coats . this saved me a lot of money from not having to do professional cleaning . clean off crayon marksa visiting toddler made a drawing on my wall i had trouble removing it until i tried an eraser which worked ! remove scuff marks from wood floorsone pair of my winter slippers leave black marks on my wood floors .an eraser takes them off without damaging the floor . cushion picture framessome of my wall hangings seem to have a mind of their own and keep moving slightly askew . i glued the tips of erasers to the bottom corners of the frames and the picture now don t move hang perfectly and leave no marks on the wall .a have a wall clock on a shiny finish painted wall . the clock would get adhered to the wall for years even though the painting has been done years ago . i glued a tip of erase to the back bottom of the wall clock to create a bit of a space between the back of the clock and the wall problem solved ! remove residue from stick on labelsi use erase to remove the gummy substance on book covers or picture frames left by the price label . this works better than soap and water . eraser just peels them off without damaging the item .arrowhead pink cap eraser is great ! i recommend it .ali julia review
i am running an aquaclear on a gallon heavily planted tank . the filter is very very quiet . it does not give the kind of water cleaning and polishing that a canister filter would give but for the price its a nice choice . i have used this line of aquaclear filters on nearly a dozen different freshwater tanks for the last decade . . . they are my favorite hang on back filters .this is the first time i have not upgraded a filter in other words normally i would have gotten an aquaclear or for a gallon aquarium but for this tank i just wanted some water circulation . the tank is very lightly stocked and the plants do most of the filtering . if you are setting up a standard tank i would recommend upgrading the filter so you have nearly double the filter capacity on your tank . ie so you have a filter for a gallon tank on a gallon tank a filter for a gallon tank on a gallon tank etc . it makes for healthier fish and less maintenance .i have a prefilter pre filter sponge pack for fluval edge aquarium on the aquaclear to keep the cherry shrimp and fry from getting sucked up into the filter . the prefilter fits on the uptake tube perfectly and is working as it should .i recently ran an aquaclear and an aquaclear on a gallon tank . both of those filters were much louder than this little aquaclear . i m guessing that the more powerful the motor is the louder the filter is . i did try the trick of swabbing silicon grease on the impeller shaft and both of those two larger filters were still too loud for me . i am now running a canister filter on that tank and am very happy with it .i ve also tried the updated version of the aquaclear line thefluval c power filter . i did not like that filter as much as the old aquaclears . the fluval was not any quieter and there was so much hardware in the filter box that it really forced you to use only their filter media . one of the great things about the aquaclears is that you can put in just about anything you want in the filter box like peat moss or ammorocks or whatever your heart desires . i like that flexibility .as much as i like the aquaclears though i leave them behind for canister filters when the tank is any more than gallons . hang on back filters are ok but for a big tank or for any tank that needs top notch water quality give me a canister filter .i had two tetra gallon rating and wanted to get a stronger one . got this and this one is weaker than the ! the outperformed this rated gallons ! on the and gallon tank ! so i now have two tetra powering a gang valve supplying airlines total to a and gallon tank . the is left to work on the gallon tank !save money and get the tetra instead !i bought the aquaclear for my daughter s . gallon aquarium . we are currently cycling the aquarium and getting it ready for a couple of fish . just like my aquaclear this filter is easy to setup and works very well . the flow rate is adjustable which allows the filter to be used from a gallon to gallon aquarium .the flow rate is adjustable from gph down to gph .there is a slight rattle coming from the impeller that can be heard when close to the aquarium . this is the same sound my aquaclear was making but after several weeks it became silent . there is a break in period for the impeller and i am sure the aquaclear will be completely quiet in a few weeks .we are currently using the filter with bio max and the foam insert only . the filter was seeded with some bio max from my aquaclear power filter .just like the aquaclear the foam insert sponge can be rinsed in dechlorinated water and does not need replaced unless it becomes damaged or severely clogged . the bio max is also rinsed off in dechlorinated water and can be reused multiple times . replacement media is readily available if needed and is fairly low cost .i recommend this filter to others . the aquaclear at ghp is the minimum i would go in a gallon . i would recommend the next size up for a gallon . i currently use a aquaclear with my gallon aquarium .
the snuzzler is the perfect accessory for an infant car seat especially for newborns and preemies . the snuzzler is reversable for summer or winter and is adjustable as the baby grows . whenever the baby outgrows it the baby is probably ready to sit in the infant seat without extra support . this has worked so much better than rolled up towels which are constantly moving . it is also important to note that the snuzzler meets all official flammability requirements . towels do not and are usually cotton which is extremely flamible . it is now months later . we stopped needing the snuzzler in her infant seat at about months old . we had it stored for awhile and then brought it out again to use in her high chair .other reviewers mentioned that this is a must for smaller babies but our daughter was nine pounds when she was born and she was so snug and comfy in her car seat with the snuzzler . she is almost pounds now and we are still using it .snuzzler provides the ultimate support and hugs the baby in all the right places so the little one feels secure and comfortable . we also use one in the stroller for extra padding . i like that it s adjustable and will grow with the baby and the design allows it to be used virtually anywhere in the car seat stroller swing high chair you name it ! it may even be used as a sleep positioner in the crib to prevent the baby from rolling over .we use our snuzzler every day and it doesn t show any wear at all . it washes well doesn t shrink bunch fade or pill and may well serve more than one baby .this really is a must have item for a new mom . you can use it in car seats in bouncy chairs in baby swings etc . i use mine in a bouncy chair that my newborn would not be able to sit in otherwise . a great purchase for the price . definitely worthwhile to have on hand for whatever baby item needs extra head and neck support .
i have mine attached to one of the support arms on myon stage ks xx pro double x keyboard stand . while this attachment is designed for both square and round tube supports i was unable to use it with anon stage tier folding z keyboard standeven with the top tier removed . the reasons for the problem with the latter stand is the friction fitting on the attachment bar was too small for the oblong support tube and had it mated the height of the attachment bar would not have cleared the top of the keyboard .when attached to theon stage ks xx pro double x keyboard standwith anon stage msa tb adjustable microphone boom blackattached to the top screw in post that perfectly mates with the boom this attachment bar boom combination easily clears the height of either keyboard i use aroland rd nx digital stage pianoor aroland v combo key stage keyboard .bottom line make sure your stand can accommodate this attachment bar according to the manufacturer it will work with most x style stands and carefully measure the height of the top of your keyboard from the center of the support arm to which this attachment bar will be inserted . the total height of the attachment bar after insertion is approximately . . if your keyboard is still too high for the attachment bar boom or other mic holder to clear you can gain an additional with ashure a x mic mount extension tube .the box contained a bag with just the bottom half of the stand . the top section with the mic thread attachment was missing . sent it back and did not reorder .this is unique piece that slips into just about any tube on a mixer rack or piano scissor stand . the square nut design is very tight when tightening in the tube as if there are a rough cut on the threading . the mic end of the mount works pretty good . overall the only problems i found is that the up tube could be to taller and the threads could be buffed out at the manufacturer .
these lids are awesome . they fit every size of cat food cans that i have and my dog food ones too . what a great idea to put so many different sizes under one lid ! i did not read that it fit many different sizes of cat food cans . i bought this because i thought it was a cute lid . thanks for this cool idea . what a nice surprise ! fast delivery and good packaging .this is the perfect sized container for my dog s food . i have a lb border terrier and i buy a lb bag of food each time and can drop the whole thing in there including the bag . it s a perfect fit . the lid seals the food up pretty good and it s easy to open and close . i was skeptical at first when seeing how the latch was online with the molded connectors on the back but it s pretty solid .my kitten eats plenty of wet food and was on oz cans for quite some time . this cover sealed those cans and it was not difficult to remove . a lot of people have reviewed this stating it s too hard to remove from a oz can if it were any easier i d be worried that it wasn t sealed . the coolest thing about this cover is that now that my kitten is on . oz cans the same exact cover can seal her food .only negative is that i was fooled by the photo into thinking i was getting two covers you only get one .
anybody who has worked on a engine knows that they need a oil filter wrench if they want to remove the oil filter off of the engine . i am sure we have all seen those standard oil filter wrenches where you slip them onto the oil filter and pull that lever which tightens it against the filter .thats all well and great if your oil wrench is the proper sise for the filter you are trying to remove cause if its not your out of luck there buddy . i have one of those big rig style oil wrenches and its too big to fit onto inch oil filters and because of that lever you can t get them up into tight spaces to work them .so i went looking for an oil filter wrench which would work great for small filters hence small engine work . thats when i found the jaw universal wrench being sold at amazon .com . i was a bit worried when i bought this because i saw how small it was in the amazon image thought it might not be strong enough .oh how i was wrong first thing i noticed when i took it out of the box was how heavy it was deffinetly meant for the most tightest of filters . there was a guy at amazon who said that he went to a hardware outlet to purchase a adaptor because he did not have a drive rachet . oh how i feel bad for him he waisted his time essentally he bought an adaptor to adapt from the adaptor .hence it came with an adaptor and so if he just pulled the adaptor out he would have noticed it has a built in drive for rachets as well . oops the jaw is fully adjustable from and inches all the way up to inches so thats why its universal . all you have to do is put the jaws onto an oil filter attach your rachet socket wrench and begin loosening the filter .the only thing i don t like about this design is that you must keep holding it if you let off pressure even for a second the jaws will slip off the filter . its not bad however once you get used to it and it works well . you tighten on the filter the same way just switch your rachet direction switch .i would have liked to have seen rubber going down the jaws as to protect the filter from getting scratched . if your not worried about cosmetics then this won t matter to you . but if you have a race car for car shows you may not want to scratch up your oil filter using this wrench which has no rubber on the jaws .however this wrench design has a huge advantage over standard filter wrenches in that you hook onto it from the middle of the wrench . what this means is you have a hard to reach oil filter in that honda ? no problem stick on a few extensions then your rachet stick it up there and wala instant access !all in all i think this is a great oil filter wrench . but it would have been nice to have a lock mechanism on the wrench to keep it from slipping off the filter if you let off pressure . and it would have been nice to have had rubber going up and down the jaws as to keep the filters from getting scratched .date purchased price paid . recommend yesit fit my ford crown vic police interceptor p .do this it actually helped my car run smoother . you should have seen the jet black junk that came out of the in end of the filter when i dumped it out ! how the filter was working i don t know !i heard these filters are supposed to come with new hose clips but neither of mine did on two separate orders .if you haven t done this before it can get messy with a pressurized fuel system taking the gas cap off did little to relieve the pressure . get a pan rags fire extinguisher eye protection and a hose to wash yourself off ! it seems like the gas squirts out all over and it does but if you re quick enough and wrap the hose in rags you will have half a chance . no open flames sparks hot mufflers etcetera ! danger ! ! ! gas explosion death !there are clips on either end of the filter that look like they come off however you can buy a little plastic set of clip release tools lisle angled disconnect tool set that fit all of the clips on the car . you slide them into the hose and it spreads the clips for easy removal and i reused mine again .i needed this in order to drain the waste tanks on our rv in case i wasn t able to do so on way home from a trip or removing antifreeze from tanks in the spring . it twists on fine makes a good seal to the drain fitting and the hose outlet fitting does end up on the bottom so almost no liquid is left inside when draining is done .
screws are very soft and are easy to strip and not stainless .plate is flimsy so think thoroughly about how to secure it bestfirst of all this product contains a mounting bracket ! for the first time ever i didn t read reviews here before purchasing and bought a separate mounting bracket which amazon lists as frequently purchased together . on the flip side though i doubled up the brackets to make them a bit more sturdy . the bracket will bend backwards from the force of pushing the pin plug in otherwise .the adapter itself is made of a thick plastic so corrosion shouldn t be an issue . both covers work well and should keep out the elements though dielectric grease should be used as well . the wires are heavy enough gauge and have good jackets to them and the included crimp connectors are a nice bonus though i always recommend soldering them .my only complaint is the cheap screws that come with it . everything needed to mount it is included but it s very soft steel and strips with little effort . do yourself a favor and pick up some nice stainless screws at least for where it mounts to the vehicle .truly does exceed expectations . perfect size . keeps the nuts bolts together with the sockets and screwdriver tips . as others have noted the magnets are really strong and can hold bigger items as well as smaller items . and finally since its magnetic it can be easily stored out of the way with nuts by slapping on the side of a metal tool chest .
its probably because my baby isn t tall enough but he can t put his feet on this thing without it sliding when he is on the toliet . the top surface is nice but the bottom needs more slide resistance .this won t work on most tables that have a skirt or that expand as the skirt and the slide rails for expansion get in the way .this a nicely molded piece of plastic simple no sharp edges . just the right size . our son started sitting on it for pracice at mo . his feet can be on the ground and hye likes to sit on it . the pail comes out easily to dump and the bottom has rubber so it doesn t slip on the floor . shield is also high enough for potty .
we bought this to take on vacation but didn t realize that it shouldn t be used once your infant can crawl out of it . it s also pretty rickety with the extra feet to bring it up to the level of the bed at the hotel and one of the sides fell down when our son pulled himself up on it .we ended up bed sharing with this sidecarred to the bed just in case our son rolled but there was no way he d stay in it .personally i don t see how this is better than having a pack n play next to the bed in bassinet position . once your babe can crawl you are supposed to lower to playyard level anyway !it works well enough but it takes so long to get all of those snaps around the crib rails ya might as well just change the regular sheet .i love how easy this gate is when walking through with my arms full of sleeping baby ! it takes a heavy step to open but it s truly baby proof !
i ve ordered these before from this seller without any issues but the last batch is not inches wide they re about which although isn t much means my promo inserts that are printed on x stock no longer fit . aside from that they re great little bags but on this occasion i ve had to request a refund .man this stuff is tough .i worked in book processing for an academic bookseller and i ve used a number of different products that claim to reinforce and strengthen but this stuff is the best i ve seen short of a now discontinued kapco item that sold for almost three times the price .if you have any old or hard used books do yourself a favour and buy a roll of this stuff . whether you re planning on reselling the books or not you want to keep them in good shape .i ve also used this tape to reinforce the corners and covers of my heaviest gaming books . when you re carrying a pound bag of rpg hardcovers in your trunk they tend to get dinged no matter what you do but there s been a marked decrease in damage since i ve wrapped up my most used tomes .highly recommended .the folders are adequate not like the m bubble envelopes you get in the stores but with the money you spend on these you could only buy three m folders and they do the exact same thing . this size is great it will hold any thickness of book you need even an x book easily and if you want to really economize you can cut them in half and use them for two dvd envelopes .
very playable right out of the box and very beautiful . i have a epiphone swingster nighthawk and violin bass and they are all great products ! i decided to give it a good set up . after the strings were off i sanded down the bridge mm and adjusted the neck just a little . then i want to really recommend martin bronze strings light or extra light green box for an awesome sound and easy playability which is important on strings . instructional videos can be viewed on youtube before you go for it or you get a guitar tech to do it .ps matching epiphone cases are available and so are inexpensive clip on pickups if you want to go thru an amp or line in recording .ps the tuners are a bit to close to each other in my opinion . when you tune one string your fingers can rub against next tuner .can t play any instrument that has wood pegs without having a small bottle of peg drops . though i don t know why they don t put guitar type turners on violins cellos and basesmy axesepiphone lp studio deluxe plustopfender maraudertakamine g squier standard stratsquier standard pj bassbeen playing years .i had a squier bullet and it was a cheap guitar i didn t care about that i could keep next to the couch to play rocksmith with . but it got old and i wore the frets out so i needed a new cheap guitar for rocksmith . i picked up the lp special in black at guitar center for and they kicked in free strings .bought it for a game but soon found myself using it more than my other guitars because it sounded so good played so well and had a killer tone .my lp studio had it s pickups replaced with the zakk wylde s which made for good metal but it lost some of that bluesy tone that passives have . imagine my delight when my inexpensive epiphone had great sustain tone and playability . considering this thing is almost the same prices a bullet squier it is easily twice the guitar for that price . you literally cannot find a better guitar for than the special . . . . .sound two passive humbuckers have a great sound with glossy highs deep lows and they put just the right amount of dirt on a tone for a gutsy clean or distorted sound .the pickups were wax dipped and did not have the microphone feedback effect .the pickups are high output and feel like alnico more than ceramic . not sure which they have .so much sustain for a bolt on neck . i was shocked .build quality i did have problem with the high e tuner . i didn t notice in the store but the string peg was up out of the headstock . when i discovered this i loosened the string whacked it with my fret hammer and it popped right in and stayed that way .intonation required no adjustment .action was exactly the way i like itneck was straight with no fret buzz or excessive bow .the finish was perfect . no nicks blemishes just oily black goodness .neck was flush with no gaps or seams and professionally shimmed . damn good for a bolt on .hardware is typical for the price but does the job stays in tune very well .back bending headstock and x orientation mean no string trees which makes tuning much more stable .the bridge is similar to my lp studio with the tunamatic setup . individual strings may be intonated but action is done with two nuts ie can raise one side higher or lower but not individual strings .weird having the toggle between the volume knobs but i soon got used to it . no pickguard and it doesn t need one . lots of relief between strings and body . you won t find yourself hitting the pickup housings or body with the pick . makes it easy to clean too !truss rod is behind a nice body color plate .frets were smooth rounded and played nice . could use a little buffing for silky smooth but not rough .neck plays fast but the nut took some getting used to . i would catch it on my hand when fretting at the top soon got used to it and it wasn t an issue . k pots and side body trplug keeps the cable out of the way .overall came with hex keys for setupcame with an awsome poster with all the epiphone guitar modelscame with a nice bumper stickerno manualbody was packed in foam shroud with foam blocks about the same as any other guitar .summary this guitar is the best bang for the buck of any instrument i own . it sounds good enough to gig with out of the box . it s well built plays well and if you treat it well it should give you years of great music . the frets are medium jumbo s and a little deeper than a fender meaning they should last longer before needing re fretting than a typical affinity or bullet squiers in this price range .i would say this guitar is suitable for all styles of music . i did blues metal country and pop . the pickups are humbuckers which means they are darker and higher output than a fender not as much of those nice fender bell like tones and chime but it makes up for it with power and clarity .one thing i like about epiphones and gibsons is the volume pot is not close to the bridge . this makes it very easy to palm mute and play with high gain . i lay my pinky and the knife edge of my hand lightly across the strings right where they hit the bridge and it makes a nice mute but on my strats the damn volume knob is in the way .as an experiment i took the pick up pole scews out of the bottom pickup to see if i could get a single coil sound out of it . what happened was a mess because of the parafin wax which got everywhere . the tone was a little brighter and output a little lower still no hum but you wouldn t fool anyone into thinking it was a single coil . i ended up putting the screws back in .i will likely put my lp studio stock pickups back in hell yeah coil tapping here i come ! and move my emg s in this lp special and make myself a nice little metal guitar .do yourself a favor buy this guitar even if you already have a better guitar . it s cheap enough that you won t care if you bang it around a little and good enough that you will enjoy playing it for many years .
i don t know if the slight color difference indicates a different taste or texture from the original nylabones or if it s just the different shape bumps and ridges but i think my dogs may prefer the dura chew over the original . sometimes i smear peanut butter into the crevices especially for less enthusiastic chewers .i don t know if dura chew offers flavor choices like the original does but in the original bacon seems to be the most desirable flavor .it s funny this product is cheaper than another product on here that has san francisco bay brand in the title . this is the same brand same size same product . good quality minimal dust . helpful tip on the back to soak the worms before feeding .i have been brushing my dog s teeth times per week with this dental paste and i haven t noticed any noticeable improvement in his dental health including his horrible breath . i would rate this as an average paste . the dog doesn t mind the taste judging from the fact that he does not struggle as much with this paste as another i had tried previously . for this reason i am rating it three stars for the effect it has and for the fact that the dog does tolerates it .

technical details saybrand name averyitem weight . ouncesproduct dimensions x . x . inchesitem model number color assortednumber of items size pack of ink color fluorescent yellow fluorescent green fluorescent pink and fluorescent orangemanufacturer part number however the packaging does not say fluorescent anywhere they are just normal highlightersi have an old original one that is out of ink and that one clearly says fluorescent and dennison on top of the word hi literthis one says made in mexico the original says made in the usaslight difference in shade of color in the plastic as wellthe two are identical in shape and sizei m a bit of a pen fanatic and love to have a wide assortment of colors and types for different purposes . i got all the different sets i could find of the sakura brand and was very happy with them . this set includes lime deep purple coral orange yellow aqua magenta red marina blue and pink . all colors are fluorescent tones . note that these are my descriptions of the colors not theirs . these pen cases are clear and have a shiny colored cap that indicates the ink color which is imprinted with a crescent moon and one star . the ink is matte and vivid and goes on very smoothly .introduction this is a non refillable roller ball pen colored in a neutral white silver light beige with oblong accents . the nib is a fine point .performance for the price you get a very smooth flowing pen smoother than most pens in the fine medium range . the point is not designed for detail work . instead the pen is best for fast note taking more so than a medium point for example . you can also get a decent signature out of it although for that purpose some will prefer the medium point . the blue is your basic blue neither especially rich nor washed out . due to the relatively short regular nib there is very little variation in line width but the pen does write precisely . the pen is comfortable but feels a bit too thin and light .looks the pen is very pedestrian looking with a nondescript except maybe boring color and repeated clear oblong shapes surrounding the pen s middle . when the ink supply is low these oblong windows reveal how much is left although this takes a little effort . a more efficient procedure is to hold the pen nib up and look through the clear section though with non functional lines printed on it above the nib . perhaps the designers were going for a retro early s look with these accents but they aren t enough it s just not a very attractive pen .features the pen has a snap on cap a broad functioning clip . there is no grip surface on the pen but slight widening in the midsection helps one hold it . although the end screws off with considerable effort the pen is not refillable .summary fortunately this inexpensive pen s best quality is probably also the most important for a tip on the fine side it writes smoothly with no or little skipping . this is uncommon in a pen at this price . a better looking pen with a richer blue ink is the zebra zeb roller rollerball pen . mm blue ink gold barrel lt asin b om e . compared to this pen the zebra rollerball is more like a medium point but it looks better has a rich blue ink and writes just as well .
does what it says it does . . . . . .looks great !what can i say ? it does what it says and i like the weight of it . . .makes it feel solid . i also like the led light they put in so you can take the pressure in the dark dim light .pros battery driven flashing or steady light flameless flare can be used as a map light reusable . could be used effectively as a light that does not seriously degrade night vision .cons product claims to be visible at ft but this is only possible within a few degrees of view . one half of the top lights up for a dim presentation but the bright led shines out through a narrow beam like a small red flashlight . consequently the flare would probably not be useful in a traffic situation since it would have to be precisely aligned with oncoming traffic and would only be visible by the few drivers within this narrow beam of light . it is certainly not a good substitute for a real flare which is much brighter and omnidirectional . this little light is not as good as the emergency flashers built into vehicles .if you want a safety flare to carry in your vehicle buy the real thing . if you want a light you can use as a map light without distracting a driver or to see where you re walking without seriously degrading your night vision this red light will do that well .
this makes carrying treats much easier but the drawstring is loose within the bags and slips down a lot . when you try to tighten it with treats inside the bag will cinch closed below the treats leaving some out .this really should be labeled light weight tie out cable . it s an awesome cable and i hope i never have to find out how many pounds it takes to break it . usually the plastic coating over the cable breaks up first and pinches the dogs legs so we replace them long before they give up . this cable is much lighter weight than i expected but that s a good thing . less weight for the dog to drag over head . i think if you had a really strong dog you might want the next size up or have good shock absorbers on your over head cable .this is a good harness . it fits my lb yorkie he s larger than average but not fat . when we travel i use this harness with the kurgo automobile zip line so he can go back and forth in the back seat . the harness allows me to pick him up and put him in or out of my car easily . it is easy to put on and remove with just one buckle on his back .
i have these same m mounting tapes each with different mounting weight . used them for many reasons for many years and have not failed me .bought two of them at the same time for use in seminars units both failed to work . returned both to amazon . will try another brand don t waste your .august . i purchased two of these phones to wall mount in my basement and garage . they work meaning they ring but i get complaints about voice quality on every call . cost was . each with free shipping assuming the order totaled at least . despite some remarks that these phones can not be wall mounted those statements are simply not true . i have two of these phones both of which are currently wall mounted . as noted in the instructions you must reverse a clip on the base unit for wall mounting . that clip then provides a tab hook that keeps the phone firmly in place on the base unit . this type of arrangement is essentially universal to all phones that i ve ever seen that can be both used horizontally or vertically . to switch the tab from horizontal to vertical mounting took less than seconds .another bit of confusion . a few reviewers state that the cord from the base to phone is hard wired and can not be replaced with a longer one . that is not true at least in . the cord has standard clips on both ends and can be replaced at will .yet despite that mis information i m very disappointed with the voice quality . every time i answer these phones people complain unsolicited about the voice quality . a hard wired phone as opposed to a cordless should sound great but clearly these phones don t ! your only real option for a better hard wired phone would be a panasonic at about . .
the colors are great and it does bend and twist but it s rattle is so faint that you can hardly hear it .he does not love it but he chews on it and bangs it all over so i guess he likes it this music cube is a great idea but unfortunately the sound quality is terrible . the violin doesn t sound at all like a violin . overall it s very tinny and hard to listen to .
item was exactly as promised . shipping was speedy and item came packaged for safety . great seller . i will shop again with this seller !i love the convenience of prime and that makes it possible for me to get these delivered to my door for the same price as i can get at the store and never have to waste the time or gas ! i will continually reorder all my accessories for my tank right here on amazon ! in this instance i cannot even get this large of a size in my local pet stores . . thanks amazon !these filters used to be sold at petco but not any longer . it is great that i can get them from amazon when i need them .
i own this product and the baby bjorn . my baby does not seem to like the nojo very much and i prefer the bjorn in almost all aspects . this product is more difficult to use and less secure . the position of the baby can shift with your movement ie if you go from sitting to standing or if you need to lean over a little bit that disrupts and upsets my baby . although you can breastfeed in it i think it is easier to remove the baby from the sling before nursing but i have to admit that i feel the same way about the bjorn and also feel pretty comfortable nursing in public . the bjorn holds your baby closer to your body and heartbeat and my baby definatly prefers that . for an infant the inward facing position of the bjorn is also more protective from strangers and germs . maybe i ll like this product better when my baby is a little bigger . i do use it at times when i don t have to also deal with my toddler but the physical demands of a three year old require too much movement to safely use the sling . it does distribute the weight pretty well and is a welcome break to the shoulder fatigue sometimes caused by the bjorn . it is also better if you are eating reading or writing because the baby rides much lower .i love the idea of this sling and it is sturdy and attractive but my week old son just cannot get comfortable in it . i keep thinking he s just too small and is getting lost in it but even as he grows i am still trying to make him more comfortable by adding a blanket to position him better . i really want to use this sling but i feel like he s either too deeply inside the sling and he will suffocate or by adding a blanket underneath him he s too close to the edge and will tumble out . the edge draws strings to tighten him in just do not do the trick . i ll keep trying because this product seems like a great idea and it was not cheap but perhaps it s just a little too much work for a newer baby .if this company or any other consumer has any ideas on how to improve my situation with this sling i would love to hear from them . email me at jul yahoo .comgreat pillow . i like this better than the boppy . its a little bigger . i love the strap helps so baby doesn t slip down and more secure as well . i also love how i can just throw it in the washer and it dries very quick . my daughter loves it . i use it for feeding tummy time and just sitting with the straps . wish there was more material options but not a big deal . best of all you can t beat the price . so glad i got this over the boppy .
i needed a way to boost the input of a wired lapel microphone coming from the preacher directly into my powered speakers . works great !i primarily use this as an usb adapter for my headphones so that i can connect convert the . mm headphone jack into my pc .the audio adapter is well built . it has a yellow led light that is solid when plugged into an usb port and blinks when there is a device that is connected to it through a . mm jack .installation was flawless . windows bit installed drivers immediately .no issues . no nonsense . simply works !this tascam us usb audio interface is exactly what i was looking for to record from our wireless mic with xlr outputs directly to my pc video editing software . we professionally produce instructional videos and needed this for voice over work on existing footage . before getting this convenient little unit we had to record into a camcorder and then import it into the pc so this saves us a step when we only need to record audio . here are my observations plug and play connected to my pc via usb and was instantly recognized usb powered no external power needed a big plus when using my laptop good sound clean and clear input multiple inputs xlr mic rca stereo line and hi z guitarmisc xlr input is not powered not a problem for us includes audacity software but we did not need to load ithighly recommended !cfh
i m using it for my alesis q midi keyboard . folds up easy so i can tuck it away . it may not work with a keyboard smaller than keys . as you lower it the support spreads out wide . good quality . adjustable height and for the dept of the keyboard .i have mine attached to one of the support arms on myon stage ks xx pro double x keyboard stand . while this attachment is designed for both square and round tube supports i was unable to use it with anon stage tier folding z keyboard standeven with the top tier removed . the reasons for the problem with the latter stand is the friction fitting on the attachment bar was too small for the oblong support tube and had it mated the height of the attachment bar would not have cleared the top of the keyboard .when attached to theon stage ks xx pro double x keyboard standwith anon stage msa tb adjustable microphone boom blackattached to the top screw in post that perfectly mates with the boom this attachment bar boom combination easily clears the height of either keyboard i use aroland rd nx digital stage pianoor aroland v combo key stage keyboard .bottom line make sure your stand can accommodate this attachment bar according to the manufacturer it will work with most x style stands and carefully measure the height of the top of your keyboard from the center of the support arm to which this attachment bar will be inserted . the total height of the attachment bar after insertion is approximately . . if your keyboard is still too high for the attachment bar boom or other mic holder to clear you can gain an additional with ashure a x mic mount extension tube .this bench is great for the keyboards and when i just want to sit and play by bass guitar . regarding it being too short you just need to lower you keyboard from a standing height to sitting . if it is too short then you must pay attention to the adjustable heights listed in the product description . i also had no problem with a bait n switch issue .
this pencil is all metal . the tip retracts when you engage the clip . there is a twist function on the bottom of the pencil to twist to ensure you remember what type of lead you have in the pencil . the heaviest pencil of the mm pencils i purchased . eraser is the standard tiny pentel size . made in japani haven t used this sharpener for long since the beginning of december but it works wonderfully ! some pencils sharpen better than other pencils but this sharpener works lovely . a tip do not sharpen colored pencils or pencils with glitter and designs on it . i made it a rule that these pencils are not allowed in my pencil sharpener . also do not allow students to use this sharpener . it will not last if you allow students to abuse the sharpener . make sure you empty the cup or the sharpener will not sharpen effectively .writes smoothly and is a great feeling pencil . quality design and looks good .the only complaint is that compared to the phd pencils the erasers are very difficult to manage .the cap clicks into place easily and protects the lead and tip of the pencil . it travels well because of this and the profile . though i prefer to use mypaper mate phd mechanical pencil retractable . mm black barrel when at my office .
very necessary when you have an aquarium a shallow mine is cm high and with this extension reaches almost to the bottom for the filter to pick up water from the bottom and not superficial .fit my gallon long wide high just right . the two glass pieces came already inserted into the plastic piece that allows the glass to be lifted for feeding . the other extra plastic piece goes onto the rear glass piece in case you have filters in the back and need to cut slots out for them . however i don t use that plastic piece and have a inch and a half space that fits well for my filter and heater . it also comes with an attachable handle that makes it easier to lift the glass .i have to reset the top of the skimmer part every day to allow it to float on the top of the water and then within hours usually it has sunk down so the whole thing is underwater again and no longer skimming the surface as intended . also you need to have a cut out on the hood to allow the adjustment knob to stick through unless you have your top water level about down from the top . i like the water level to be above the plastic band of the top of the aquarium so you dont see the water level when viewing .
not all kits include scissor digital thermometer tweezer etc . this is one does . the compact pouch securely holds everything in place which is great for traveling . great value !we love this playpen . the colors are great and the attached toys are engaging . it folds up and unfolds easily and the case that comes with it is really going to come in handy when we go on vacation . this kit has all the essentials . great for travel . roomy case to add first aid stuff . a must have .
i bought this phone after returning an at t . ghz cordless set . i was a little wary because of the poor quality of the at t phone but the reviews on amazon gave me the confidence to try this uniden model .the reviews here are spot on . the phone has excellent range and voice quality and its minor detractors are just that minor . here are my observations pros this system is expandable to handsets including the handset on the base . this gives maximum flexibility in deploying in your home or small office . don t be confused . get the tcx handset . msrp . this is the one that is recommended for provided with this phone i believe amazon recommends some other handset . very good voice quality . clear signal no interference . this was a major detractor for the at t phone . ring tones musical ringers . you also have the ability to set personal ringtones for people in your address book . you can set different ring tones on each handset . up to numbers in your address book . however the phone book and cid system share memory so it s a total of numbers . hm . but each phone book entry can have numbers so you don t have to have multiple name entries for person e .g . mom home mom work . however the multiple entries are not delimited by text so you have to remember which is home and which is work . directlink walkie talkie mode . you can set two phones into direct mode and do a walkie talkie system . however you also have an intercom capability as well . multiple handset conference call capabilities . if you pick up a call on one handset someone else can join in just by turning on a second handset . dropping off is easy . . .just turn off the phone . there s also a privacy mode in each handset that enables you to turn off this function . do not disturb function can be set on the base it will turn off all the ringers on all the handsets . advanced caller id . capable of normal caller id plus call waiting caller id . caller id to phone book . can store a caller s info into the directory . room baby monitor . can listen to the sounds from any room that has a base handset . speakerphone on base and handsets . nice ! customizable handset banners . name them for the room where they belong ! remote access . standard stuff . only a two digit security code though . one key speed dial . set up to speed dial numbers . press the speed dial number and hold and it will bring up the corresponding speed dial entry . it doesn t dial until you re ready just in case you picked the wrong speed dial . normal answering machine features . call screen toll saver etc . i wish it had a dial out notification .cons no dial in remote room monitoring . this would be nice to dial into the system and hear what s going on . phone books and cid shared but not synchronized . you have to copy the phone books from one handset to another instead of it being sync d across all handsets . you also have to delete cid from each individual handset . base display is a little convoluted and confusing . the only way you can see if the answering machine is on off is when it s actually off an icon appears . this was a little confusing . most machines have a little glow light button that turns the machine on or off . you have to do this through the ui . shorter answering machine record time . only minutes up to messages .all in all this is an excellent choice and value .this phone has a nice big well illuminated caller id panel and the big buttons are nice . the speaker is clear . it has a flash button for call waiting or call transfer . the only thing i don t like is that it does not have a hold button only a mute button so you can t push hold hang up the instrument and pick it up on another instrument .the uniden tcx offers all the same features as the handsets that came with several other multi handset uniden phones . it is a solid phone handset with the . gigahertz frequency ranking as one of this phone s greatest attractions . i have found that i can stray a good distance from the base and it will still function normally . my home and yard are not huge but i still had problems with fading signals with my older phone . i often had to reposition myself if i was outside in order to get my old cordless phone to receive the signal . but with uniden tcx there is no need to reposition myself or the phone . the signal is still clear even when i am standing in the corner of my property .the lcd display on the uniden tcx is nice . it isn t very large but it lights up in an orange color and it shows many bits of information like the date and time the phone number and name of a caller when an incoming call is trying to ring through a battery charge indicator an indicator telling you the number of different caller id s that have come through and an indicator telling you which handset you are using you can program each one with its own number . the lcd contrast and the ring volume can be adjusted on each handset making it customizable per room . you can even change the display to read in english spanish or french .uniden tcx is compatible with many different uniden phone systems . but in order for this expansion handset to work it must first be programmed with your main phone . this requires entering specific code numbers into your main phone s base unit . if you do not program the phone will not work . programming is simple instructions are included for programming into different main phones and it must be completed or the phone will be worthless .there are only a few things about the uniden tcx phone that are deserving of criticism . first it can get a little tedious trying to program new names and numbers and one needs to be careful not to get carried away because it can take a long time to get everything programmed just right using abbreviations is a good idea to speed up the process . second i don t like the flashing red light in the upper left hand corner of each handset . this is a charge indicator that lets you know the phone is charged and ready to go . there is nothing wrong with letting consumers know this but to have a light that continuously flashes can be a tremendous distraction . third the base is small and light and it can easily get knocked off the table or desk on which it rests . fourth i would prefer a plug that didn t have a block attached to it . this makes it easy to grip but it also means the plug has to be inserted a certain way or it will partially cover the electrical outlet directly underneath it .overall in spite of a few inconveniences i am still satisfied with the purchase of my uniden trx handset and i may add another one or two handsets like it in the future . they sell for a reasonable price and they are compatible with many different uniden phones . clear sound slim design and countless features make this auxiliary phone a nice addition to any uniden household in need of extra phone units .
the brother pt p touch electronic labeling system is a very inexpensive and easy to use labeler . we bought this when it was in the lightning deals so got it for a very a good price indeed .pros solid constructioneasy to useeasy to get consumables label cartridges cons eats batteriesno ac adapterover all highly recommend for household light usage .the targus wireless presenter comes with a carrying pouch usb transceiver device the remote control a single aaa battery and some instructions . the carrying pouch felt extremely cheap and was made of an inexpensive fabric material with a drawstring enclosure . the usb transceiver was automatically detected in xp sp environments within seconds . it will be identified as a . ghz rf keyboard and functions fine in over different pcs and different versions of microsoft powerpoint .the remote control accepts a single aaa battery and as always i use rechargeable nimh batteries since they offer more capacity longer life and the ability to be recharged thousands of times . the only drawback is they have a high self discharge rate resulting in the need for a recharge every months even if you don t use it .the remote control has controls . the on off switch is a slide switch on the side that is concealed to prevent accidental shutoffs . there are buttons to go to the next or previous slide to switch between applications to darken the slide go to a black slide and one for the laser pointer . i verified the remote control functions within feet but it starts to have diminished control at the farther ranges . i am not familiar with any presentation environment where you are feet away from the presentation pc so this is a non issue . the laser pointer isn t terribly bright and is a very small dot . i have my doubts about its effectiveness in a presentation environment .pros it worked properly out of the box on several different computers all running xp sp and different versions of microsoft powerpoint . can use rechargeable nimh batteries to reduce battery costs . it is small enough to throw in a laptop case or backpack but large enough that you can use it comfortably .cons the carrying pouch is very flimsy and cheap . the laser pointer is rather weak but at least you have the option of using it .overall very affordable tool for use at the office or school and gets the job done .at t e c . ghz cordless answering system with speakerphone caller idi replaced a failing panasonic corded phone with this compact cordless model after testing several at my local electronics store . i chose the at t e c for a number of reasons style the feel of the handset solid ease of use and functionality . a belt clip and wall mount are included .what i got was a well made attractive and multi functional unit with expansion capability up to eight handsets . programming was easy the standard message simple and clear enough to use without adding a custom message even though i did add my own .there are separate phonebooks in the handset and the base each capable of storing up to entries and the handset screens incoming messages . call transfer way conference calls and last number redial are additional functions of this unit .two lithium batteries are included note directions state only lithium batteries should be used caller id and call waiting are included capabilities if you subscribe to these services .both handset and base are programmable with features such as ringer volume ringer melody remote access and caller log review .all in all this is an easy phone to set up and one that offers superior performance .recommended .
doesn t do anything for me but my cat loves it . you have to take my word for it because she cant type .if you have cats that decide they want to jump over this thing it won t work so well . the size of it is great for litter boxes with covers there are cats that can t stand the texture of this thing and try really hard to avoid the texture . know your cat . . .it works for many but there are a few that it just won t work for .the tan mat is gray but the cats don t seem to mind . just wish it did something to keep the litter under control . one cat just jumps over it . . .doesn t like the nubby things . the other cat steps on it but the next step is off from it so litter isn t kept to the mat . would be great for a kitten or if it was larger .
our dog has been using these pads for years . we originally got them because we lived on a busy street and didn t want to let her outside at night and risk she might run out in the street . later she developed diabetes and with both of us working she would have wee wee several times a day . these were a life saver . they are absorbant enough to both capture and keep everything in one spot lol ! we highly recommened them .we were paying per month to get this product at our vet s office . we have saved a lot of money buying it online and it comes right to our door so it is more convenient too . we camp and hike and do a lot of activities in the tick ridden out of doors here and with permethrin on our clothes and this on our golden retriever daisy we are tick free when we get home . if we do find a tick on her it is already dead and comes off easily . for this reason we still get her the lyme s vaccination each year . this is our first dog and we worried about needing to get our carpets in our home bombed for fleas every fall like a lot of our friends need to . with this product she has never brought home a single living flea .we travel a lot going to our son s gymnastics and swim meets and daisy gets boarded or more weekends each winter . if we forget to use this every month in the winter and we sometimes do we can put it on her two days before boarding and any fleas she picks up from other dogs there or at the dog park will be dead before we get her home . she was frightened by fireworks once at my sister s lake house and bolted in panic and was lost in the woods for two nights . when she found her way home hours later she had over ticks on her but every one was dead .i can t say enough good things about this product .our older dog sometimes has trouble jumping into the suv so we bought this for him . it was very easy to train both of our two dogs to use this ramp . we have had the opportunity to use this when we go on our long hikes we are out for hours and have two very tired dogs when we get back . they walk right up the ramp with no problems .i have had the ramp for about two months and i would recommend this ramp as it is easy to use and to train a dog to use it . we keep it in our back seat to always have it handy . i look forward to using this ramp for years to come .
playtex cups are the best ones on the market . everything they make is interchangeable which is very budget friendly . the valves tend to accidentally go into the garbage disposal or disappear in the dishwasher because they are clear . the replacement package is essential but are not easy to find in stores .i just received these and i m really disappointed . number one they are made in pakistan . number two they are incredibly thin . i keep looking at the package and it says there are in there but it s hard to believe . these are going back .these spare membranes are a must if you are using a breast pump . they are so small it s easy to lose one especially when cleaning all the breastpump and bottle parts . so buys extras . they don t cost much and are worth it in terms of convenience .
when you first get this body pillow it will be extra firm . you have to massage it and work the pillow to loose that firmness . i ended up having to take the cover off the pillow to help loosen it up . they have it packed so tight inside . used that case as a template to sew a new one with a little more room . best thing for pregnancy .nice mid weight fleece . like that there is room for little feet to move . fits well around the neck . but a few times the zipper has come apart at the top when it is zipped up . i had the same issue with another halo sleepsack . seems like a low quality zipper for a high priced item .it s too small for standard contoured changing pad ! plus it shrinks in the wash ! it is also very poor construction the stiching around the elastic that secures it was coming loose when i opened the package ! needless to say we returned it !
i was hoping to use the clay bar to remove water spots on a new truck but the one provided with this mequiar s kit was worthless for this purpose . the kit does include everything you need to apply the products in the kit which is a plus and probably the reason the kit is so popular .i haven t had the need to install this yet but plan to this summer . i always use acdelco parts when working on my gmc because i know i can t go wrong with genuine gm parts ! i will update this review once i install it . thanks amazon for having acdelco in stock when i need parts for my truck .edit installed this along with theacdelco idler pulleyfor my gmc sierra x . tip if working on a similar truck make sure you remove the top half of the radiator shroud to make it easy to get to everyting . install is pretty straight forward .i was simply delighted to find purple locktite . i needed the right product for set screws on rifle scopes . purpose locktite is not to be had in local stores . go for blue and you commit your set screws . i needed something that i could use with a small screw and remove if i needed to without stripping anything or resorting to heat guns . this is perfect .
when you purchase this product the advertisement leads you to believe a separate power supply is required but it does come with its own power supply . there is no need to purchase a separate behringer psu sb .otherwise the time machine works fine as described .arrived on time . . . works as intended and maybe more .one day i was pondering how best to de clutter my wall receptacles from a glut of power adapters and also my table from a spaghetti of ensuing power cords used to feed various v v dc equipment on my table or rack . fortunately i chanced upon this little gem and in an instant . . . my problem was solved . i chose the v adapter with the highest rated power output and used that as my primary v dc source and this little gem to power all the other equipment on the table or rack . i also bought another similar unit form another source here on amazon and used that to supply the v dc source to power the rest of the units that needed a v source . everything worked fine and i relegated the remaining adapters to storage . been working without a problem to this day .i own a one spot but ran out of plugs for all my pedals . this product allowed me to lengthen my cord and provide the added power supply that i needed . no tone loss at all . great to have an extension rather than having to get another power supply ! ! !
i bought this at babies r us . it did not fit my rail . it says it fits most standard rails but doesn t give any measurements . how are you supposed to know if it will fit unless you purchase it ? what a pain .great product does what it needs to do if only the product works better for small baseboards under in . the template does not do well on baseboards since it will be short a few cm depend on how thick the baseboard is in depth .overall pretty sturdyi don t understand why they would make a product that does not fit standard corner tables ! i need to return this item
they are a bit slick and need to be sand blasted or something . i would not buy these for any tire size inch or smaller . get a x cut it use it .i still use the square aluminum jack stands and i guess it really all depends on the brand you have or something cause these pads needed to be about bigger to fit mine so i was not pleased with that though i didn t have anything to block up my tongue when parked so these worked for that i guess . they need to make these things a tiny bit bigger then they can put a picture of a basic jack stand on the front . . . . till they do it s really false advertising cause they do not fit either sets of my regular square aluminum jack stands .i did order these for a banding tool but had to return them because the bands i use don t work with this tool . although that being the case these are a well built tool and would probably be the stuff when used with the correct type of band .
frontline plus for dogs mths lbsi have tried other brands and nothing compares to frontline .this is the best price i have found .all of the other brands are a waste of time . merial frontline is the only brand that has ever worked on our dog . i won t waste my money on any of the cheaper options .marineland activated carbon may be a bit more expensive than other brands but the granules are more consistently sized and smaller and are therefore function better and this carbon contains far less carbon dust than other brands i ve tried . i use it to refill the filters in my cat and dog water fountains too . it works great !
measure carefully because i did not . yes the outside measurement of the stand is inches but my laptop is also inches so rather than sitting on the desk below my monitor it sits on the legs of the stand . this means i need to be very careful with the docking station so it seats in properly . but the stand looks nice and will do for now . fuzzy wuzzy s summary highly recommended with warm fuzzies !packaging style appearance excellent fuzzies ratingconstruction build quality excellent fuzzies ratingcompetitive pricing value average not good not bad fuzzies rating positives high build quality with good welds and smooth semi gloss black enamel coating . strong steel tubular legs can support up to pounds . if you use this as a laptop riser stand by placing a laptop on the top shelf the surface is perforated with many holes to allow for great air circulation and heat dissipation . negatives there are no negatives with this product this is an excellent solidly built steel stand that both looks attractive with its uniform semi gloss black enamel coating and can support a large computer display monitor or any other item weighing up to pounds . you can either place this on your desk or on a table or countertop e .g . some people have a computer in their kitchen to organize your computer laptop keyboard display layout better .this monitor stand weighs . pounds and has outer dimensions of . width x . depth x . height . the top shelf has surface dimensions of . width x . depth . the space underneath the shelf is . wide which is the . outer width minus the width of the two tubular legs . the space underneath the shelf has a usable height of . which is the . outer height minus the height of the tubular metal that supports the top shelf .even though this is advertised as a monitor stand i am using this as a laptop stand placing a inch laptop on top of the shelf . my computer desk already has a raised shelf where my two display monitors are positioned and my desk has an adjustable keyboard tray where my keyboard and mouse reside . i have multiple desktop and laptop computers so sometimes i place one laptop underneath this stand s shelf with its lid closed and a vga cable connecting that laptop to a larger monitor and another inch laptop sits on the top shelf of this stand . when placing a laptop on this stand where i use a separate bluetooth keyboard instead of the laptop s own keyboard the stand s perforated metal surface functions like a ventilated platform to help cool the laptop . since many laptops have their fan intake vents located underneath the laptop it is advantageous that this stand s shelf surface is a perforated metal grill to allow for great air circulation all along the bottom of the laptop . most of the other laptop riser stands are either made of flimsy plastic or metal mesh that is too thin with too much flex in the structure .but regardless of whether you need to place a large display monitor a large laptop or other item this stand serves as a simple sturdy and modern looking support .i have a soundbar connected to the television in my living room . both are in a large entertainment center and i didn t want to mount either on a wall . i ve had the soundbar in front of the television for some time but it blocked the remote control transmission for the tv remote so i had to hold the remote up high when i was manipulating the tv .i finally found a stand that i felt would work for my tv . the m adjustable monitor stand ms b is adjustable in height so that i was able to get it to a height that still fit in the space my entertainment center had for the tv but lifted the tv enough that the soundbar no longer blocks remote control commands .the stand was easy to put together and also easy to take apart when i put one too many pieces on the legs . the legs and the platform feel sturdy . m suggests it can hold up to pounds and so far it has held myvizio e d vx inch class theater d lcd hdtv with internet appswithout a problem .

i am reading lots of bad reviews on these pigtails . what worries me the most is some seem to be shipping with a different thread type and people are stripping them trying to make them work . why the heck can t these be standardized ? i ve also read that some come with different sizes of npt as well as different thread types . it seems that what is listed is not always what you order and on top of that someone like me who does not know how to recognize the different thread types and sizes won t even know if i received the correct part or the wrong part .i recommend you double check your part number on the hose before installing them to avoid stripping your regulator .i thought why not use quick connect hoses to connect my regulator to my appliance . it seems these mate up nice to other quick connects but only if made by camco and then these quick connect fittings don t mate up easily to the other parts like regulators etc . wtf ? i need still another adapter ? and some people tell me perhaps multiple adapters to make it all work ? i m not going to use three different adapters to mate up a quick connect . that means i have a huge lunking thing sticking out ready to be damaged knocked out of place that is sure to leak out all my expensive propane .ok so i called camco . i wanted to be sure i ordered the right part and spoke to two different people at camco that blew me off . it seems camco parts don t necessarily fit each other . and they don t sell adapters to make them fit . it would be great if they could provide some customer support and perhaps make up some custom hoses to help people make things work .i give this a star because camco s huge fail in helping me put together a system that will allow me to hook up external tanks to my rv .one star also because they ship different types of hose fittings and buyers don t know what they are getting .honestly i d like to order one of every one of their parts and analyze them . i m an engineer and if i can t figure out what to order based on conflicting information reviews that report receiving different size fittings npt than specified npt and a multitude of part numbers and a need for adapters when a buyer should be able to buy everything he or she needs without an adapter it all tells me camco has not thought out how their products are used .think about it there are only so many way propane tanks hoses and appliances are hooked up . i don t see any need for adapter other than those that attach to the tanks .it worksi needed oneit was cheapit did the jobi may never need it again as i myself don t force double threaded things but others are apparently not so intelligent . stihl concrete saw is back on the jobi win another one .i will probably loose it due to predation etc before i need it again but until then i can correct any careless plug screwing that may come my way .this is the oem cabin air filter for the acura tl and trust me this thing does what it s supposed to do . i couldn t believe how much crud this thing had caught between the b service on my girlfriend s tl .one thing i will say is that this is a pita to replace . after disconnecting the glove compartment door and removing the two screws and push fittings securing the assembly to the console pull the console down . directly down . that means sit in the passenger seat and apply equal force to both sides of the assembly . . . or you ll break a tab and your interior will never be the same . i ve seen two people make the mistake of busting the tabs loose right to left . don t be another .
i buy these often . we have a husky golden retriever and lab mix all large dogs . they love these chew bonesmy lbs lab mix loved this bone ! perfect size for him to chew on . definitely would recommend this to others !both our dogs love these pet tabs . an yr old cocker spaniel and a yr old mix breed . the vet recommended them to us .
i got this tender for charging two motorcycles that i have . i was able to fully charge a brand new battery i purchased its recommended to charge a new motorcycle battery after adding the acid . i like that this comes with a long enough cord so i can plug it into the outlet without moving my bike or using an extension cable . it also comes with the clamps and adapter you can use if your battery has this for easy charging . i used this on a shorai battery for my cbr and worked great .there are no settings to change just attach the connection to the battery and plug it into the wall outlet and you re good to go .great tender for a good pricesure the switch placement sucks but i do like the pump overall .i can plug in to a outlet or use the volt car accessory outlet .installed in a friends van so he can charge his pc and cell phone when he camps . i had to cut off the clamps and solder wiring with a fuse and on off switch directly to the battery . created a watt draw and the inverter didn t even get warm . so watts should not be a problem . i would buy this unit again 
the sterilizer was given to me as a shower gift . i used it for a few days until i realized it was so much easier to use my dishwasher . my dishwasher can wash hold more bottles than the sterilizer . you have to be careful when removing it from the microwave it s extremely hot and can cause serious burns . for those with a dishwasher stick with the dishwasher . however if you don t have a dishwasher this is pretty nifty for the price .this is a great product easy to clean and storage . i now put my baby puree food and you can travel with . you can use in microwave top rack dishwasher sterilizer and bottle warmer . it may use use the plastic so i always clean them by hand . i love them !these spoons are perfect for babies just starting solids . they are light weight easy to hold small amounts of pur eacute ed food and i love that they are dishwasher safe . the package claims top rack safe but i have been able to wash them with the rest of the silverware on the bottom .
i purchased this for my sugar gliders cage . previously i ve purchased wood style perches but they start to stink after a while in a cage of sugar gliders . this perch is washable so i won t have that issue .i wish this had bolts screws to to go into the cage with rather than hooks . i don t feel these are as sturdy and with this perch being somewhat heavy for a small mammel if it falls and hits them they are probably dead ! i had to use multiple zip ties to ensure it didn t get knocked down . so that slows the cleaning process and will add to my expense as i ll have to put new zip ties in every time i remove this for cleaning .as another reviewer noted the gaps are quite large in the wiring so you ll want to ensure its safe for your pet . i don t believe i ll have any issues with this in terms of my gliders getting their heads stuck in them i think they are just large enough that its not an issue for me . but depending on bird size it might be a possible issue .overall i like this and will probably buy more unless i can find something with screws like the wooden perches prevue also sell .i wish i could write a book about this cage but i ll try to leave out the fluff . this cage has pretty much everything i ve been looking for in a bird cage . it s very well though out and must have been designed by a team that s had experience with birds . the slide out tray is deep enough for whatever you use to collect waste i prefer pet wee wee mats with alpine bedding on top . but the birds can t make a mess in their waste because there s a grate which is positioned above the collection tray . plenty of room for the birdies to have fun hop around and for all the stuff that comes with keeping birds . nice easy wipe finish plus too many other features to list here . the only minor criticism is the latch on the main door it s a bit odd imo . but there s not much that could take away from the star rating of this cage . and let s not talk about affordability this is a steal ! it s easily worth in the range and i ve seen that price in my parts . you will love this and so will your birds !both my cockatiel and my canaries love these and i love them because they can be molded to fit any shape i want . makes for an easier way to allow birds to get to the various toys food items without using so many other perches . bonus multiple perch sizes in a cage keeps birds from getting sores on their feet . i m sure the soft rope texture is also a welcome change of pace for them too .
i used an avent pump with my first and let me tell you how great this pump is . all you do is attach the liner to the breast pump fill it up and cap it and you can store it or feed right then . it is so comfortable . you have settings to choose from for the speed and suction . it comes with bags for everything . the carrying case case for traveling with milk and bottles and case for the parts . love it ! ! it cannot get any easier than this . i pump ounces in less than minutes . try this and you will love iti actually can get more milk faster with this than with the cheap electric pump i bought . this one is easy to use and quiet . if you are pumping more than once a day it could get tiring but otherwise it s great !i used the advent isis for a while but found that i was maxing out at about oz each time . this pump gets me at least if not oz each time . this was helpful as i pump most of the time and nurse only one or two times a day .the carrying case makes it easy to pump at work and anywhere else i go .
this calculator is excellent you can easily enter in fractions and decimals and along with all the basic stuff . the buttons are nicely extruded easily pushable and just a light tap will make the calculator register the input . a very useful feature is the fact that you can type in equations as they look in your textbook . linear equations can be easily solved by changing the mode . also this calculator can give you the coordinates for any equation .example input f x x options start a end at steps of output bonus points for being able to having the option of a entering in numbers and having the calculator output a solved quadratic . the calculator solves the quadratic formula for you one of the very few problem is that this calculator had a bit of a learning curve . it took me about two weeks to fully understand how to use every feature . this calculator is good to the point where its banned from certain algebra tests . it makes doing the work too easy according to my teacher . another problem would be the fact that the manual is just an bunch of mathematical examples . as in there is virtually no actual english in the manual . it just shows you a bunch of diagrams . of course if you know what its talking about then you ll know how to perform the actual function . but honestly you probably don t really need this calculator until algebra ish . i mean if you get it in algebra good for you . but you ll only use a handful of this calculator s features . my final complaint would be the fact that the calculator outputs problems as a improper fraction . there is a button that ll change the output to a decimal or a mixed fraction but its just a minor annoyance .example input . . output fraction once you press the s lt d button it ll change the output to . but overall this is an excellent calculator that s worth at least double its current price !great toner lasts a long time !lasts me at least two or three semesters of schooling .will print thousands and thousands of pages before even slight fading .at the end when the toner begins to fade just moving the toner side to side as opposed to shaking it which causes toner splatter will give it life for many more pages until your next toner cartridge comes in .well the other guys are all complaining about amazon s shipping charge . amazon s free shipping for over offer comes and goes so if you see it in effect it is as of today grab whatever you need . as for buying the ink tanks just buy all three colors in the set at the same time to qualify .anyway let me talk about the ink tanks themselves . the three bci ink tanks work in the canon pixma ip printer . maybe in other models as well but i have the ip . these are official canon ink tanks so you ll know they ll work well . the number of prints you get heavily depends on your printing habit e .g . what you print how much you print and at what quality you print .using my usage as an example . i print at normal quality most of the time and i print about photos at or dpi depending on needs and web pages e .g . flight confirmations hotmail messages etc . . i don t print word text documents much . i ve run through sets of ink tanks and my very rough estimate is each set has lasted about . x sheets . maybe more but i don t wish to raise your expectations too much . suffice it to say that of all the inkjet printers i ve owned photo or not the ip has a terrific ink capacity record . of course if you use one color more than the others that particular ink tank or ink tank combinations will go out faster . for your reference a few months ago i read in a magazine review the the average per letter size print cost of the ip came out to around cents per page on plain paper one of the lowest average costs for inkjets . not sure what settings they used in their tests or how much they paid for ink tanks though . in case you are interested . . . the new canon ip model employs a new formula of ink which supposedly will not fade for at least years . my own take is no matter how you print your photos even at professional photo labs a photo print will eventually fade if exposed to light . it s just a simple law of chemistry . so be sure to archive your digital photos on cds or dvds so or years from now you can still print fresh copies and relive your treasured memories in their full colors .
each bx d speaker has its own amp onboard and power supply . want a channel system buy speakers and run xlr audio to each one . no noise or hum . has both trs and xlr inputs has a knob for gain control on back . most importantly each speaker has an iec connector for power to just that speaker . mine sit left and right of my mixing panel using trs outputs which copy the xlrs those go to my marantz pmd digital recorder w gb of datacard memory onboard and a nice set of vu meters . speakers include a foam stick on bottom to prevent buzzing against hard surfaces . there is however no mounting point no captive nuts or such .you ll need to adopt a philosophy on gain . you can crank the speaker gain to and use your mixer to set the levels but ensure that your recorder gets enough signal to be in the to db range . it may be a tad loud in that case you may want to set both speakers to their oclock position which is power approximately .you could alternately use the mixer to run near db and turn it way down on the speakers . i like to use mine to listen to talk shows before falling asleep at night so i turn the volume way down but drive them with db off the mixer .having a separate power supply and amp for each speaker makes for some great isolation .my first nitpick is there is no grill cover on these like other maudio products have . i will have to fabricate some protection . my second nitpick is i owned the smaller m audio monitors where the amps were in the left speaker and the right speaker connected with twin lead speaker wire to the left i .e . not true bi amping but smaller spkrs for my mixer . the speaker w amps died at mos after buying it . it was not the power supply as being on made the box warm but the led surround around the vol knob would not light and you could barely hear the audio even with db into the trs line in . thats a different cheaper model by maudio but i had to trash it and buy these which are much nicer !i do like this set of speakers . from stereo to . surround they do the job with differential audio inputs . i may get more for ch as i have a sub already .i bought this product for only one reason i have several amps that are not guitar amps but stereo or pa type clean high powered two channels that i want to use as guitar amps either as the primary or backup . this tube modeler acts first as a pre amp and then adds gain volume control crunch whatever to the non guitar amps to make them sound like guitar amps . i don t really care what tube amps it models or what mic placement i just want the guitar amp sound and style . i also use it in front of a behringer ultra g di box so that the di box splits the signal coming from the tm and sends half to my non guitar amps and guitar speakers on stage and the other half to the house pa . i don t think that many people would do this .the sound you get out of this box is affected by what amp and kind of amp you are driving with it and also what kind of speakers that amp is driving . the acoustics of the space you are playing in also affects the sound but i ve used this box with all of its settings driving pa amps home stereo amps bass amps and guitar amps all of which drove pa speakers bass speakers and eminence commonwealth guitar speakers all in the same acoustic space . each combination of amp and speaker with all settings on the box held constant sound different some more like guitar amps and speakers some not . as i said i don t really care about what tube amp is being modeled only that i get an authentic guitar and speaker sound out of the box . it works for me .i read reviews that say that this is a digital knockoff of the analog sansamp gt and based on its performance so far it has served as kind of like a cheap preview of what the sansamp can do . i would consider getting the gt in the future but for now this product is for me the poor man s tube amp .these dual amplified speaker cabinets are something new for me as i am used to the normal dual cabinet one amplified set up like the behringer ms which i was trying to replace with these but on second thought will set them up someplace else as they do not have front controls have only one trs or xlr connection point require ac power for both and as p frary has stated are very dependent on input they kind of worked with my stanton s and not at all with my laptop .they are as stated by other reviewers very subtle and may take some getting used to . because of the dual amps you don t hear the sound travel from cabinet to cabinet as each speaker cabinet is a stand alone unit .i actually hooked one up like a guitar amp and it worked fine just a little guitar amp that sounded great .for your normal stereo mini jack and rca hook ups i would go with the much lower priced ms s which have multiple rca jack in points and one stereo mini and full front controls .addendum i finally hit a home run with these speaker when i hooked them up to sony cd changer unit i have for the living room dialed in the speakers and put them both on one on off switch . the soundis full and fills the room .
inexpensive yet works as good as the ones sold by honda dealerships . made true to specs and fits right into the slot on my accord .will buy again .exact replacement from oem . exact fit worked perfect . have no fear on using this one it will suit your needs .fits my john deere lawn tractor which is model la and likely it fits all the l la and d series lower end john deere tractors . please post a comment if it does not and i ll update this reviewcurrently amazon says it does not fit my third generation miata nc but it doesthese filters come top in most online filter tests and i use them in almost all my cars
highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering suspension work . you will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover .i hate to use the pickle fork . the pickle fork is the last resort for me as it will damage the balljoint boot .i prefer to use the snap on balljoint remover . if that one cannot fit then i will try this tool . if this tool will not fit then i will resort to a pickle fork .it worksi haven t really used it yet for the reason intended changing the oil in my jet ski . so i can t comment on how well it works . the main reason for this review is to put it out there that it does not work with a chevy silverado . the siphon tube does not fit thru the bottom of the dip stick tube . it would be really nice if mityvac had a published list of what vehicles it works with and what ones it does not . i have my fingers crossed that it ll work with my jet ski otherwise there will be a new un used mityvac on slist . long story short do your research to see if you can confirm or deny if it will work with your vehicle before you buy it .
philips avent bpa free classic bottle sealing discs work on both the classic and the natural . clean easy and are slightly rubbery for a tight seal .it does what it says . my avent bottles are travel ready with these discs .if you have avent bottles these are a must .while these discs will still fit on the top of an avent natural bottle and hold a seal they don t fit snugly in the nipple hole like they do with avent classic bottles . so milk won t leak or spill but when you unscrew the ring you have two pieces to mess with . unfortunately i wasn t able to find a sealing disc for the natural bottles hopefully they re coming soon !update i did however learn that the rings forphilips avent bpa free classic bottle screw rings packfit on avent natural bottles so i just ordered some rings and now the seal fits nicely in the ring on my natural bottles ! !
this car seat base does not work with graco snugride seats . just make sure you order the correct one .we had gotten this seat belt tighter for both our cars a subaru outback and an audi a . for the subaru the mighty tite was too bulky to work well it was pushed up against the car seat and it was difficult to tighten completely . it fit well on the audi but when we got our car seat installation inspected the police office checking our seat said that she did not recommend this product . she has actually had one break while installing it ! since it is not made by the car manufacturer and not made by the car seat company you should be wary of being lulled into a false sense of security just because you have this product .we are very satisfied with this car seat . we have car seats by this brand name . all have worked well . no complaints .
i wish there was a guide somewhere that shows you what cars these sunshades fit . i bought this one super jumbo for my toyota camry hoping it would fit . well it did not fit . i had to return it and order the regular jumbo sunshade . the regular jumbo sunshade fits the windshield like a glove . quality is good and it folds up to about . so if you have a toyota camry do not buy this one ! ! ! order the regular jumbo size .amazon can you please look into getting some sort of reference guide that will show customers the correct vehicle application ? this would make buying this product a whole lot easier .cpsthese are great . i was concerned the inch size would be too much with stock tires but they are perfect . they give my jeep a new look and take years off the body . easy installation but i will warn you if you have the stock bolts do yourself a favor and spend the or so bucks on the hardware kit advertised on amazon as it will save you a ton of time . as for these fenders perfect fit to the oem holes and what a difference ! a simple ratchet and box end wrench were all the tools needed and of course the small work shop rolling seat i got on amazon makes the job comfortable because you really need to be able to sit down to do this job .these don t fit quite right onto the stems of my pirelli p zero s . the dealership neglected to put a cap back on my tire so i bought these just in case . they get the job done but don t expect them to look or fit the same .
works very well in my fax . i would recommend it to any one who needs a brothers ink cartridge . what can you say for an ink cartridge as long as it works .bought the official refill ink cartridges for our epson printer . they work as they are supposed to .this is a printer refill and does the job . the problem i have is that the ink tends to run out extremely fast and in the future i would probably go with generic printer refills instead . it will do the same job for a fraction of the cost . if you want to play it safe then by all means by these cartridges .
the colors are nice however the ink seeps through and shows through the other side which is pretty annoying on double sided pages .we have two computers and two printers in our household and seem to go through a lot of paper . this paper is of good quality and works perfectly with inkjet printers .the paper is very white and sufficiently opaque to permit two sided copying without bleed through . i also appreciate the storage feature which permits the box to be placed in a closet for storage and yet provides quick and convenient access to any amount of paper .i will buy this product again .this is the best double sided tape available . i have used many different kinds but this one has them all beat .
as a lot of epiphone owners have learned cases designed for the gibson es clones won t fit epiphone guitars as the epiphones have a slightly larger headstock . this case however fits my dot custom like a glove . the padding is perfect the top is arched to precisely fit the guitar and the build quality is better than you might expect at this price level .the fender mini electric guitar stand is not made for the fender squire mini guitar . the guitar falls through . i will have to buy a differant stand for him rendering this one useless . the fender stand for standard guitars will not work on the size ether .this is a great value . i contacted the company for measurements inside the case to see if it would fit an ibanez rg series . it fits perfectly . thank you
i was worried my dogs would get confused as to which doggie door to use . i have a patio door doggie door and when i closed my screen door my dogs could not get in or out . now with this in my screen door i can close the screen and my dogs can still get in or out . great idea and works well with the patio doggie doors . they are so smart they know which to use and when .we were looking at the glass door inserts but not only do they not allow your sliding door to lock but they are hundreds of dollars . since our only goal was a way to let our cats in and keep the flies out during the day we were leaving our screen door open for them this seemed like a perfect alternative .it was easy to install i do suggest leaving a little more screen then they suggest when you are doing the cutout and works great for letting them in and out .a couple of items about it to help you make your decision if you live where there are alot of mosquitoes or gnats they will be able to fit btwn the cracks in the unit . you will have to close the glass door to keep them out . works great for areas like ours in ca where we just have to worry about flys and wasps .i recommend installing it in the middle of the door . when i lock the cat door they paw at it if they want to go out and it can get rough on the screen . we installed it in the middle of the door and so we can just close the glass door halfway to keep them from pawing at it .no assembly flip open and use it . works on my toyota mini van fold up when done and lift using the built in recessed handle on the side . i am a guy and can carry with one hand like butta
the height is spring operated and adjusted by tightening or loosening a screw . unfortunately the adjustment doesn t work very well and it always keeps inching higher hard on your neck if that is a problem for you .it rotates well enough though .this type of a short truck in general has a design flaw of the axis far behind the handle so it tends when loaded to fall strongly pushes forward that requires a big effort to counteract puts significant strain on the user arm s muscles causing fast fatigue . in short it is a very bad type of a hand truck .in order to comfortably truck a load the handle must be behind the axis in relation to the ledge so as to provide leverage to easily balance the load over the axis by only slightly tilting back the truck . however tilting a short truck does not move much the handle back . so a proper design must compensate . it can be achieved by placing the axis just under the handle as in sparco compact luggage cart or by bending the handle toward the axis as in vestil steel hand truck or by both as in norris pound capacity multi purpose folding cart or safco . the lucky ones could find the yf black luggage cart for as little as in some cent stores .just you ordinary ring white binder with clear cover . this binder has round rings inside that have a trigger on each end to pull apart to open . hard to close using triggers . it is easier to close by pushing the center rings together but be careful it can get your finger .
i have a gallon freshwater tank and i keep on it and the water is cyrstal clear so i guess it is doing it s job .this is a great filter for what it is a small waterfall filter for limited fish . i am presently using it on a gallon tank holding my koi that are being overwintered in the basement . since they aren t very active at degrees this is working well . i understand this is a waterfall filter but i wish the uptake tube had a bit more versatility to it . while it has an additional tube to stick on the end for deeper tanks and a multi layered filter i m not sure i would be confident using this on much more than a gallon tank . in fact i m kind of nervous using it on a gallon tank i just don t think it turns the water over enough for what it is rated for . so my rating is based on what i am using it for not the gallons they claim it is rated for . is that clear or more confusing ?i have two of these one i keep at work for a small desk tank and one i have at home that i use with my son on his salt water tank .reliable accurate well worth the price .
excellent little book stand for the desk but will hold a book no more than thick so don t expect it to hold a dictionary . it s made of heavy solid wire and is sturdy and stable . a good value .sturdy compact yet expands to hold a fair amount holds up well . beyond that it works as advertised . good organization if you need alphabetized sorting .overall i believe this copy holder to be a good product .pros good looking although it will most likely be hidden behind copy or a book holds books flat due to elastic band and bottom lip wide enough for to hold two x s very sturdy due to the heavy base cons seems the clear plastic could break also due to the heavy base adjusting the angle is not as easy accurate as it should bealso of note this won t work well as a cookbook holder because there is no splash guard for the books
the description says the color is gold . it s not . more of a greenish yellow but does what it is intended for . i think i would stick with the black color though .nice cover for my behringer xm . it is fitted snugly and well made . the color is nice and bright . i wanted to have other colors but this is only available in red and black also .pretty disappointed in the color . as the review title indicates what i received is more of a black chrome or dingy stainless color . these are simply not going to work with the mots pickguard i purchased them for . perhaps they would blend in better on a black black pearl or tort pickguard .i ordered another package from another vendor and got the same result . perhaps it is a large factory shipment that is bad . some are very dull looking . very disappointing really .
it can hold the weight of any of my guitars . its easy to install and i guess its cheap . it doesnt always come with the screw covers but that doesnt really matterremoves grime and such . makes surfaces very smooth i don t know how it works individually i used it with gerlitz cleaning spray . it works well with cleaning spray .no complaints about this hardware . easy to install with patience easy to use . the click on off system securely holds your strap and prevents the strap binding from slipping off the post .these work like a light switch . . .on off so i m not sure how you can rate them as poor . there aren t really any directions so it takes a little mechanical knowledge just a little . . .it s not rocket science to make them work .quality metal secure function and easily replaces posts on instruments already equipped with standard strap posts .i ve installed these on a hoener full sized squire acoustic and fender strat s .
we bought this to use to feed our two adult cats whenever we go out of town for a few days . we chose this model because it was reasonably priced and holds enough food for up to six days . the unit has six pie shaped wedge sections that you fill with food one section is always exposed so it basically holds food for today plus five more servings . there is a switch that lets you select between or hour serving intervals . at the preset interval the lid advances to the next section . each section holds enough dry food forup to two cats if you fill them up . there is no clock display on the unit there is a manual advance button on the unit whenever you press this the lid rotates to the next opening and it resets the timer so that it will advance at the preset interval after this or it will advance at the preset interval after you install the battery one volt alkaline battery . there are some small water tanks on the botton that are intended to be filled with water and frozen to keep canned food cold but they are useless after more than a few hours . overall the unit does what it is supposed to do very well without any complicated clock or timer settings to worry about and it is large enough to hold a few days worth of food .my lovebird loved the smaller one of these i had for him so when i purchased a larger cage i bought him this one as well . he uses them all the time and as they are wired inside you can bend them into the shape you require for more functionality . this is the only perch my bird will hold onto as well he is a bit on the elderly side and grip tightly and flap his wings to exercise his wings . he even hangs onto it upside down . he loves it as i m taking that as an endorsement and i therefore can easily recommend this product .update this week one side of the rope pulled right out of it s plastic attachment that attaches to the side of the cage . i have therefore dropped this from stars to as i had to go out and buy some gel superglue in order to the glue the rope back into the plastic fastener . i was not very happy about this as it is still quite new and a lovebird is simply not very heavy and this particular one is not a chewer . seems a bit shoddy workmanship . i still recommend but you may find you may have to glue it back together as i did .in order to advance my crusade to improve bird nutrition and health i wanted to include here a recipe for a fresh diet that a breeder i highly respect gave me thank you angela just to offer some advice to keep our pet birds healthier it is not at all related this the product i have reviewed here but it could very well give you some great ideas to get fresh fruits and vegetables into your bird .all domestic birds especially parrots lovebirds parrotlets parakeets canaries finches conures etc should have fresh fruit and vegetables and they can present a challenge to get them to eat them . gives this recipe a try here s a recipe that i make and it took some time for them to get used to it but now my lovebirds and my parrotlets both eat this when provided . i give it in the morning and remove uneaten food in the evening . apple cored and chopped cup chopped raw broccoli chopped bell pepper seed included shredded carrots cup chopped greens bok choy mustard greens kale and or chard cup frozen corn can be eliminated if you put slices of raw corn on the cob in treat holders clips in your cage all my birds love it and i have had success getting them to eat this cup frozen peas cup cooked rice brown or gaba brown rice cup cooked dried beans they will need to be soaked overnight for hours a handful of blueberries chopped cherries and chopped seedless grapesmix all ingredients together in a large bowl . place ingredients in an ice cube tray and freeze . remove frozen cubes and place in plastic bags to store in freezer . then you can take out the perfect portion on a daily basis . they say cube per bird but you may find that cube will work well for a pair of birds of if smaller birds even more . instead of an ice cube tray i use slider freezer bags and press them flat after i fill them with enough of the mixture which makes freezer storage easy and this way i can easily break off appropriate sized pieces . this recipe is variable and you can switch out or add delete ingredients that you have on hand or what you know your birds already like .this recipe is in addition to their regular diet of pellets and seeds and not a substitute .hard to mess up a floating square . it does contain the food .negatives . . . .to me at least the post that attaches it to the side is long . this puts it far from the corner .overall size float size is l x w . pretty large .inside float dimensions are approx . l x w .this ring could be reduced by a third or half . the foam material does support algae and is quite visible unless you keep the water level up to the black trim .i m used to a simple x clear plastic ring with trapped air floats . this type stays in the corner with the surface tension of the water .all in all i ll use it but wouldn t buy another due to the size .
i have two yappy pomeranian dogs . the larger one periodically wears the premier gentle spray anti bark dog collar available from amazon for approx . it works wonderfully but it s only recommended for dogs over lbs . so i bought the lentek to control barking in the smaller dog .i ve had it for two months now and still use it but it only works minimally . the dogs sometimes pause a bit when it s triggered but most of the time they just continue barking .i guess the lentek s better than nothing but i wouldn t buy it again . instead if your dog is over lbs i would buy the citronella collar .i live in a townhouse complex and there are others walking their dogs . i try to keep my dog on a fairly short leash when other dogs are around . the only way i could do that until i got this retractable leash was to wrap part of the leash around my hand . not too comfortable ! this leash seems to make my dog heel better . oh and even though my dog only weighs pounds i got the medium large one for dogs up to pounds . i feel it adds more strength and it is not that thick and the handle fits my hand perfectly . i would definitely recommend getting this size even if you have a small dog . ii m no longer cutting off the circulation in my hand like when i was having to wrap the leash around my hand to tighten it just a click and it keeps my dog on a short leash . it feels very sturdy and well made .love this product ! ! ! my old dog has been taking this human grade form of cosamin ds for years and it s kept his joints limber . it s cheaper to buy the human grade than it is the pet grade for him . i like this seller and as long as the prices stay reasonable i ll stick with ordering from them . i also give him earth animals holistic aches pains drops directly into his mouth x a day to ward off any pain from old age . don t give your pets drugs that will destroy their organ s he s doing great ! hope this helps someone else .
i used this phone lifter in combination with the plantronics cs wireless office headset . it was a powerful combination that allowed me to answer my phone up to feet away from my office . this lifter fits onto your phone base and lifts the receiver when you press a button on your remote headset . you can answer the phone or hang up when the call is completed without ever touching the receiver .the lifter came with a plug in mini microphone ring detector that attached to my base phone and it allowed the base station to notify me when the phone was ringing . the setup was quick and easy and the device took up almost no space on my desk as it attached to my phone .i spent thousands of hours a year on the phone and this device along with my remote wireless headset saved me a lot of neck stress and phone holding for hours a day . this is a useful tool in any modern office and i recommend it to you .we like to keep one non electric phone in the house in case power goes out . we have learned that during hurricanes earthquakes and even big power failures that sometimes even cell phones don t work but these non electric phones that plug right into the telephone outlet work when other things don t that is if your phone service is not from the cable company but driectly from the telephone company . in regular day today activies we use only cordless and cell phones but they can be useless in an emergency so we like the safety of having one phone like this . this is fine little phone and the price as great .i was happy to find a phone with a mute button after my ge crapped out . this was a great phone for to weeks until the cord that attached the headphones starting to make a crackling noise . also the wifi network card i used interferred with the phone everytime rendering it useless while using my laptop .i so badly wanted this phone to work and work well . all other aspects were superb large reception area too many caller id stored numbers to count great features and compact plus a mute button for when one must do laundry on long conference calls from home .this phone is wonderful in theory not so hot on actual function .
i bought this sway control to help my daughter s towing of her travel trailer . it fit her trailer and ball mount perfectly and helped control the trailer way on windy days .fits very nicely onto the northern industrial utility trailer i purchased the in . x in . trailer for hauling around a scooter store mobility scooter for my mother . this trailer jack and wheel makes a very nice addition with it down the trailer is more like a little cart and it easily moves around the scooter .they fit perfectly onto the vehicle and or trailer wire when not in use . with the retaining loop they stay with the connectors when you are connected vehicle to trailer .
i added this to my double receiver so as to use my bike rack and cargo hauler at the same time . without this accessory my cargo hauler was too close to the bikes . this provide the added distance for clearance i use this with an arizona rocky road antenna mount . this is a high mount antenna mast attached to the tire carrier on a jk jeep . i am using a firestik ii and have a . swr on all channels . works good for disconnecting too . buy it !they fit perfectly onto the vehicle and or trailer wire when not in use . with the retaining loop they stay with the connectors when you are connected vehicle to trailer .
grandma was not ready to give up leather seating in her car and wanted something to protect the leather from damage when a booster seat was installed . the prince lionheart two stage seat saver seemed to be what i was looking for . not only was it somewhat more rigid than other seat protectors but it came in tan so that it matched my car s interior . additionally since i live in south texas the lighter color is more desirable for purposes of keeping the vehicle s interior from getting so hot . there should be no issue with the seat saver staining the lighter leather black as based on reviewers comments some other brands do .the prince lionheart two stage seat saver was easy to install . the base filled one of the back bucket seats the seat saver s back needed to have been about longer to completely protect the booster seat back from coming in contact with the vehicle s seat . further it would have been helpful if each side of the prince lionheart two stage seat saver had tabs that extended over the seat back . that would have prevented the booster seat straps from digging into the vehicle s seat when the booster seat was correctly installed . because of the vehicle s seat depth the prince lionheart two stage seat saver s front flap does not bend at the marked area but still provides a bit of protection to the seat edge . having a little one who likes to drum his feet makes me appreciate this feature i do wish the flap had been a bit longer and had multiple grooves for bending .there was no sliding of the britax frontier sict booster seat which was installed on this seat saver the booster seat held firmly in place . the backing on the prince lionheart two stage seat saver is a rubber like mesh similar to the material used to keep floor rugs from sliding . since i have not yet had the seat in place during one of our very hot texas summers i do not know whether there will be a sticking problem . i will probably remove the booster seat during the summer unless our little one is visiting so that i can avoid this potential problem .i would have rated the prince lionheart two stage seat saver a . if that rating had been available . with the exception of the suggested changes i am very pleased with this product .this product surely protects my leather seats but my car seat seat slides around on the seat when its in place . i m taking mine out of the car today . i ll try it again when my son moves out of the infant carrier and into the big car seat .this is one of the few seat covers without odd sticky stuff on the back that will ruin leather seats ! i love that it comes up the back and protected my seat from my rear facing tall guy .highly recommend have in all cars .
i received my order today and as other have mentioned there is only one cap although the pictures show a package containing two . i re read the information given and it does not make it clear that there is only one . at that number the price is outrageous . go to a pet store . they are much cheaper there .based on reading many reviews i assume the deminsions listed for this product are incorrect . amazon you must change according to many people it is a flat matt not inches thick as lsited in the dimensions x x inches .teast kit has glass test tubes ! easy to read number display with limit water line on glass tube . accurate test colors that matches color chart inside kit and has a booklet that show you exactly what to do . extra details that are necessary are included to buy other chemicals ! kit helped me maintain the water in top shape .
this roll of industrial strength velcro is easy to cut and apply and holds extremely well . not only has the velcro got a strong grip but the glue on the back is also strong . it holds my garage door opener on the motorcycle and there s no worry about it falling off and it also holds inch thick banners and posters on the office wall to avoid making any nail holes in the walls . if you want to remove it simply slide a blade behind it and it will come off . then a little goo gone should remove the glue residue from the surface . it s a reliable hold but doesn t have to be permanent . i always keep a roll of this in stock .when i lived in california i used this product to attach my breakables and wall decor in place in case of an earthquake . nothing ever fell down . . . . .it s great !arrived in ripped up package so i couldn t use the dispenser but that s no big deal . the velcro cuts very easily and it s simple to unroll the amount you need cut then stick .the adhesive is very strong it will tear off your paint if the item is a bit too heavy . . . .or even not very heavy . the grip can be so strong that it will pull off the paint before it gives up the grip . best to hold down the edge before you remove the item . makes it a bit difficult to use the remove replace feature of the velcro .so far the tiny remote hasn t fallen off the side of the window a c unit keeps it from getting misplaced . can also be used to hang up small items on the inside of utility cleaning closets so they don t get lost .i stuck some of the fuzzy side to the outside edge of our vacuum as a bumper so it doesn t scrape up the furniture that worked very well . i m sure other uses will come along later on .this masking tape is pretty good working not just for painting but also for taping patterns to fabric instead of pinning them and also working well to bind a big box of previously loose and tangled computer cords into tidy bunches that are easily labeled . i did find it sometimes split down the center as it unrolled you know when some of it comes off the roll as you pull it and some of it stays behind an unfortunate quality for tape . it s also sort of sticky on the sides leading the sides to become unfortunately linty and unsightly looking . i do worry that now that my roll has gotten linty on the sides it may compromise its effectiveness when it comes to making a sharp line for painting . i suggest keeping it in a plastic bag at all times when not in use .
the rd generation powerprobe includes a number of changes for additional flexibility . in short it is a vehicle powered dvm with both a foot cable and an additional foot extension giving you a foot working range around either the battery terminals or cigarette lighter outlet both clips and a plug are included in the kit .with the series units they use a hard gold plated banana jack to hold the removable probe or cables to extend your reach . if you purchase the accessory kit it includes piercing probes that self center on a conductor pierce the insulation and attach to the jack allowing you to tap a wire at any point to locate intermittant problems .while the dvm is backlit all the time it also has bright white leds facing forward to aid in finding and probing terminals in dark places . the actual probe is hardgold plated with a sharp tip and removable at the banana jack . another identical probe is included with a screw in female banana jack in the accessories kit to retrofit the powerprobe i and ii units to accept external cables and probes .if you need to excite a circuit with a connection to battery ground or to battery positive the switch allows a momentary connection to bridge the probe tip to either voltage which is useful in testing relay driven circuits indicator lights and other small current loads . the prope voltage is always displayed during testing on the meter . the voltage ground switch is circuit breaker protected in case you accidentally drive volts into a chassis ground . additionally since the switch takes abuse it is easily replaced if it fails with just a screwdriver .combined with the testlead set the powerprobe greatly simplifies testing of vehicular wire and big rigs up to a single trailer . the dvm has selectable modes of operation designed for different problems . reading the manual is important to get the full value from this meter .although the price is a little high the design and construction quality are excellent . enough wire is provided to check running lights on trailers or to look for blown fuses . all of the wiring is exceptionally flexible and heavily insulated with top quality connectors . both the tester and accessories come in hard plastic cases that can be stowed in a service box .not mentioned in specifications is that although the probe runs from vdc the meter can be used to measure voltages up to vdc .there are two horns not one . one is hz and the other one is hz .piaa automotive sports horn hz the are exact fits on the mounts as the oem horns and use the same bolts . a inch drive ratchet and a mm socket is needed to remove and install the bolt . they came with grounding leads with ring spade lugs that mounted readily under the existing m bolts on the radiator supports . all you need is a mm socket .the two wiring harness leads are too short to connect the horns . two wire tie mounts hold the harness to the aluminum bumper reinforcement . you can cut off the ties and use the oem harness to connect the horns but i chose not to . i prefer not to cut off the oem connector blocks .i made two pigtail extensions out of gauge black primary wire inches long . one end needs a inch wide exposed male quick disconnect . the other end needs an insulated female inch quick disconnect terminal . since i used gauge wire i used the red coded ones .the exposed male connector slides into the oem horn connector perfectly . the female one clips easily onto the positive terminal of each horn .the horns how have a weather shield on the apertures .best thing to my surprise is that they appear to be very high quality and made in japan .also nice is that they need no modification to the horn relay or circuit .the picture is slightly misleading . this is only the mounting bracket it does not come with any wiring . but is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a wire flat cable . the bracket is flat on one side and curved on the other . the curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch . the connector on the end of my t connector fits well and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket . it sure beets having the connector flopping around !
great wheel lock that is easy to activate and unlock . it comes with keys one of which has a led light on it . the product also comes with a reminder cord that attaches to the handle bar as a reminder . it does just what i was looking for .first you will need to buy the high tone also or it will sound stupid . it is part . i have put these pair on my last cars . the low tone does have a habit of failing if it gets wet . this has happened twice to me . for some reason the high tone works fine if it gets wet . make sure you mount the low tone in a location where it will not get wet .the kit does not include a relay . you may want to install a relay especially if your car is wired for one horn . the horns draw . a each at v . this is usually within factory limits and most fuseboxes will have a a or larger relay built in the horn circuit . the kit does include female blade connectors a mounting bracket and nut and a jumper wire needed if your car is wired with one horn lead .and they are very loud . packaging declares db at inches . i do not have a db meter but i can assure you the horns will get the job done . the pair has a nice tone and will rid your car of the little factory meep meep horns .i bought these horns to replace the weak sounding horn that toyota puts in the corolla matrix prius yaris ect . . these horns are very load to say the least . the hella box included one low tone horn and one high tone horn . it also included instructions and a single bosch style relay .there is no wiring of any kind included with this purchase this is why i gave it a star . i made my own wiring harness which included a amp fusible link and the included relay and a relay socket . the following link is to the picture of my install on my toyota matrix xr . . . make sure you use the included relay in your install . i know some people have just used the existing single horn wire not using relay but these new horns have a pretty heavy amp draw ! the last thing you want to do is mess up your factory wiring because of some horns . do it the right way and follow the instructions ! your horns will also sound better .you can not beat the price and sound quality of these horns ! they will get your attention i can promise you that . i do recommend these horns !
while i like the way these pens write i don t like how long the ink takes to dry and how freely the ink flows .ya know every once in a while you run across someone who has an excellent pen . it s like a gel but it writes so smooth and awesome . i cannot figure out what those pens are . i ask people and they tell me but then i order and it s not the same . oh well the search continues . these pens don t run on the paper and they write fairly smooth .can you really write an extensive review on elmer s glue ? this stuff has been around forever . should i go on about how well it sticks what it tastes like how i would rate it if i had to depend on it to save my life ? it s a glue stick the children love it they get it on everything but at least it cleans up .
my month old son easily pops off all the other plug covers but cannot get these off . they take a couple seconds for me to get off but not really a hassle .we were able to cover the edge at grandma s house with ease . cuts easy tape is sticky and hasn t peeled off . my daughter has tried to peel off a part and we just stuck it back on and it s still sticking and working just fine .we put this on our coffee table six months ago all but one of the corners have fallen off repeatedly . the long strips dont really protect my child much . she will still bump into the table at times and it doesnt offer much cushion . it is not really thick enough or wide enough . corners are a joke . the tape provided is not sticky enough . just keeps coming off .
i bought some of different sizes for my bird . the expensive cage i bought comes with bowls but they are too high and not wide enough for a conure size bird . these bowls are wider and only to tall instead of . with these the bird can get to the bottom of the bowl without having to throw all the top seeds out or having to climb into it to get to the food at the bottom . no mess and since they are stoneware they are strong unlike ceramic dishes .just bought some more in different sizes for my bird to use as a bath and as food bowls for my cat .bags are made to fit in canister but it takes all three to ring the tray . this product needs to be ordered in higher quanitity to have on hand .i previously purchased a small container of this product and my fish seemed to like it so . it made sense to me to get a larger container . this container has a large opening so it is very easy to remove what i need to feed the fish . the fish are growing well and love this kind of treat .
bought this so my mommy can sing karaoke on youtube . also my cousins use it when practicing before using the condenser microphone before home studio recordings with my focusrite i interface . my cousin and i can perform live at house parties and events so as to entertain the crowd . so it was something that was necessary . and not waste of money or an unwanted item . also i don t really have to use headphones because it is a dynamic microphone which reduces loop back when using skype or playing video games and talking to your friends so now i can listen through my speakers .got mine for under and it s a great mic . i can use it for vocal tracks or recording for webcasts that kind of thing or recording studio guitar sounds etc . awesome mic .notice in the name guitar input . this is not to be confused with the amplitube irig which achieves input and output through the ipad ios devices headphone jack . headphone connections can be noisy and have reliable connection problems . they also depend on the built in ad da converters in the ipad ios device . this apogee jam k is a professional quality input device that has dedicated a d analogue to digital converter but depends on the built in hardware of the ipad ios device for playback . on the other hand apogee one has both ad and da convertors for both input and output .amplitube irig from ik multimedia has a simple stereo headphone in and out jack plug that plugs into your ipad . the built in hardware in the ipad is something that i love for doing something like watching a movie cozying up to the inch screen but for audio phile quality you need a dedicated a dedicated pre and ad convertor and that is what this apogee jam k has . mind you it has that for audio recording input but playback is handled via your headphone jack on your ipad . you can of course just use that for monitoring your mix and then save the file in a digital format internally and send to a playback device with pristine digital audio quality e .g . saving as a .wav file . this makes the apogee k jam a very usable device to achieve high quality recordings at a very nice price .so here it the continuum . amplitube irig for headphone jack input and output quality built into your ipad etc . the apogee jam k for digital quality conversion on input only with playback being handled by headphone jack on ipad . the apogee one on the other hand at roughly times the price gives you both ad da conversions so it has its own audio output jack plus tracks of recording either instrument and or a balanced external microphone jack . it also comes with a built in condenser mic that is pretty amazing . it also has volt phantom power for using your favorite condenser mic . when you get into the apogee duet and quartet you get more connections plus the all too important option of midi connectivity .
this chair was very useful because the tray and the seat belt really anchors the child into the chair my yr old son already figured out how to get free of typical restaurant high chairs with seat belts . and the height change option is nice to have have not used it yet . the removable white sectional plate and plate cover ended up completely useless for me personally .although i have a basic fisher price booster seat as well as this deluxe booster seat we have children my husband mainly prefers using our brica high chair sear cover with disposable placemats to reduce of big bulky items to bring to the restaurant .i returned this seat due to a defective strap one of the straps that attaches the seat to the back of the chair came out of the seat with the slightest tug . i also did not like that this seat did not fit our dining table chairs . i was surprised about the defect because we ve been using the fisher price space saver chair and have been very pleased with it . this booster seat was supposed to be a replacement for the space saver and as a second chair to use on trips since it folds which the space saver does not . the tray on this seat is very small compared to the space saver . in my opinion it is a far poorer product although to be fair it is significantly cheaper . in any case i have returned it and am not asking for a replacement . would rather find something else .i am very happy with the quality and design of this booster seat . it is easy to use has a secure buckle system the white tray insert and cover are good ideas . works as a play chair on the floor as well .
i m enjoying using this priced right set of strings . i put these strings on my martin guitar after receiving my new dvd from customerservice peghead .nl entitled how to play fingerstyle guitar by eltjo haselhoff whose preview of this great dvd i found on youtube . see the preview and look at other youtube videos of eltjo you ll want to order the dvd immediately .i really don t see how gibson can make and sell these for ! the tech at the guitar shop can t see how either . i plugged this into my roland micro cube and tried some effects . i was really surprised to see how well they sounded . i m not a guitar player so this uke is just a toy experiment for me . if you are really into electric sound i recommend going the guitar route . if you just want to play around a little this uke will do .i am a novice musician so perhaps my lack of experience in these items . once you figure out how it goes together it is an excellent product . it holds your guitar up .
i like these allot they do a great job . screwed up and lost one so i replaced it . i love the test lights on this one and they have a that is very convenient . i prefer to wire evey truck and car with the blades and go from there with adapters . as long as your vehicle was wired right to usa uniform standards you will be pleased . they are a little bulky but work very well .these lights will be the main lighting in my teardrop camper trailer when i get back to work on it next spring . they look like good quality lights and the switch works perfectly on them . i connected one of them to v and they are nice and bright . the diffusers are great and do a good job of diffusing the light with no lines or shadows . these lights are very light weight but that is not a concern as i am building my teardrop as light as possible .if you are after led lighting these are also a good choice because you can easily upgrade the bulb to an led retrofit from most any automotive supply store amazon or ebay . they have the direct replacement leds for rvs for most any fixture .you won t go wrong with these lights .i have some fog lights that i use on the back of my truck to light up the sides of my th wheel when i am pulling in to a camping spot at night . i got these so i can easly connect and disconnect these lights . they make it very easy to connect disconnect anything you have that just needs power and ground .
my small dog loves these things . they are nice and bright so he can see them and the felt material doesn t peel off in chunks like the cheap balls do . they hold up alittle better which is nice so i don t have to replace them as often .my one cat likes to bite and it s something that i don t encourage especially with my hands ! . these little toys are great for her because she will kind of chew on them and attempt to tear them apart . the plastic is hard so it doesn t break off in her mouth . they will eventually just become mangled and i will throw them away and give her another one . they are big enough that she obviously can t fit the whole thing in her mouth so i don t need to watch her when she has them . she loves to bounce around on the bed with them too . they are a great little toy for her .i have two medium sized dogs who each have one of these . the souper size lasts them for many months as they are power chewers . the smaller sizes only last a few weeks . this is hard but not as hard as a real beef bone and is kinder to teeth and gums . they also enjoy just carrying these around in their mouths but i have to be careful i don t get one dropped on my bare foot ! these don t break off in litle pieces or slivers and are easy to clean if my dogs play with them in the dirt . i will definitely buy these again .
this toy as described is inches from nose to end of tail . what i received was maybe an inch and a half . my dog would have choked on it .this thing is so small it should be a cat toy it s the size of a catnip mouse of the length is the tail . within minutes it was chewed to pieces . do not purchase this item . look at kong chew toys instead for longer lasting toys .
this is stapler . it comes with staples . it works very well . i can staple pages very easily and without jamming . it will punch the staple through your stack of papers without jamming every time guaranteed . it also has a staple remover that works very well and feels solidly made . a great value starter pack the swingline staplers are the standard when it comes to stapling .there is nothing fancy about this stapler it is well built functional and capable of stapling pages or with only a change in the staples . when used as a normal desk stapler standard staples work fine . with them i have stapled as many as sheets . for a project that requires stapling more pages the standard staples can be replaced with the longer legged sf staples .loading the stapler is easily done lift the handle turn the stapler upside down so that the staples drop out of the track . put the stapler right side up put whatever size stapes you are going to use in the track and put the handle back in position .no staples come with the stapler .amazon sells good quality staples of both types .swingline is known for good quality staplers and staples .this is a good set for my home office a light weight stapler staples and staple remover . the stapler holds one full strip of staples of them . and the staple remover works well one pull removal .
i have no complaints with this phone . we like it so much that we purchased additional handsets . especially useful is the intercom system if you re upstairs in the bedroom you can beep someone in the basement . my only complaint is that you need to go to every phone to delete a caller id . i had purchased panasonic in the past but the uniden is much better .this is the most inexpensive and reliable way to use a magicjack . i bought a new magicjack for my university office . i make a lot of calls to canada and it would be inappropriate for me to use the university s phone to make my calls . this little phone stores neatly in my drawer . when i want to make a magicjack call i just plug it in .because of problems that some of the other reviewers mention i almost did not order this phone set but the price was too good for me to not at least give it a shot . so far we have had no problems of any kind . the shared phonebook function saves having to program each phone entering contact info into one phone makes it available from both . the couple of people that i tested it out on could not tell that i was using the speaker phone function so i use it all of the time now . the built in answering system is wasted on us because we have the phone company s voice mail service . however if i ever want to screen calls i can now because the answering system allows you to listen while messages are being left and pick up to speak if you wish .
this is a very nice set . it is very easy to set up and get started . i ll skip all my happy fluff and get right to the problems you will want to know .i m docking one star for the following problems . the belt clip is very cheap and pops off my belt frequently thus my phone has taken a few falls because of this . i m now used to just sticking it in my pocket instead . when you delete the names from the caller id list you have to delete the list off of each unit . you can t just push a button on the base and it deletes all of the caller id s from all the units . it gets old having to track down all the handsets and delete the same stuff .i realized that if you just wiggle the tape and peel off the plastic then insert whatever you have then cover back the plastic then press hard its just the same as pulling it thru the machine .no smudging no pulling off the sheet when printing and they come off easily when desired . no complaints on these labels .
works great the cut outs are cut the way it is so you can put on your jack without having to take anything off to put this on .take these saddle bags and the tail bag and your all set to go shopping weekend away . one very nice feature is they don t dent or rust . you can easliy remove them anytime you want .clever item . you can push all your refrigerator items back and hold them there while traveling . to lengthen you have to unscrew the upper and bottom rod . then you have to twist them while holding in place in the fridge to tighten them .
i always use techron before every oil change on both my cars . it keeps everything running smooth . the six pack is a good deal .fits perfectly easy to install . anyone including those with zero mechanical ability can change this filter easily . anyone who would pay the massive amount the audi dealer wants to change this filter is a complete fool .fit my sentra . perfect you can always count on wix . i routinely run them k each oil change .
i bought two sets total . i use them near the middle of the lifting range which puts the saddle about to inches high . this is perfect to get my truck off the ground and give me an inch or so of ground clearance to r r the tires and do other work underneath the vehicle .i don t need t worth of lift but i like how these j s have a wide lifting range . with these set for my range as stated above they are not teetering at the top of the range like others i ve used in the past but are comfortably in the middle . they are very stable and solid units .it would be helpful if the info stated the lifting range of the units not just the tonnage they can support as a pair .min . lift height in . max . lift height in . the bag it came with dosent fit it if youve got it adjusted to the middle or top setting this does exactley what they say seems pretty rugged it fits my duratrac s perfect and holds my lb self no prob .just opened my mail and a . inch long air hammer bit is what i measured . not the . inch as the ad says on amazon .com . hope it still works out ok . i wanted longer one that would reach into the hollow van sliding door as well as the hollow rear side panel . it s a nickle coin size and flat on the impact end . i was looking for a arched shape but this will do ?
this tascam us usb audio interface is exactly what i was looking for to record from our wireless mic with xlr outputs directly to my pc video editing software . we professionally produce instructional videos and needed this for voice over work on existing footage . before getting this convenient little unit we had to record into a camcorder and then import it into the pc so this saves us a step when we only need to record audio . here are my observations plug and play connected to my pc via usb and was instantly recognized usb powered no external power needed a big plus when using my laptop good sound clean and clear input multiple inputs xlr mic rca stereo line and hi z guitarmisc xlr input is not powered not a problem for us includes audacity software but we did not need to load ithighly recommended !cfhi primarily use this as an usb adapter for my headphones so that i can connect convert the . mm headphone jack into my pc .the audio adapter is well built . it has a yellow led light that is solid when plugged into an usb port and blinks when there is a device that is connected to it through a . mm jack .installation was flawless . windows bit installed drivers immediately .no issues . no nonsense . simply works !this gadget works fine to connect an electric guitar to an ipad or iphone or a computer but the particular one i received has a defective input socket for a inch audio plug . it doesn t snap in place . just sits there waiting to let the plug slide out . that makes it fairly useless . i may have simply gotten a defective one .
as a lot of epiphone owners have learned cases designed for the gibson es clones won t fit epiphone guitars as the epiphones have a slightly larger headstock . this case however fits my dot custom like a glove . the padding is perfect the top is arched to precisely fit the guitar and the build quality is better than you might expect at this price level .this is a great padded case that fits my soprano uke just right . i like to ride my bike and take my uke along . the small size means it fits my panniers just fine . the thick padding protects the uke from bumps and scrapes . the larger foam nylon cases are nice and offer more robust protection but they don t fit into a shopping bag or backpack nearly as well . highly recommended for the adventurous uke player .the fender mini electric guitar stand is not made for the fender squire mini guitar . the guitar falls through . i will have to buy a differant stand for him rendering this one useless . the fender stand for standard guitars will not work on the size ether .
this stand easily supports my poundfender frontman r watt x inch guitar combo ampat any height setting . in fact even extended to the highest the this stand supports that amp with no issues from the center of gravity or weight distribution of the amplifier .i love the ease of setting up and breaking down this stand . it is essentially three parts the base and two removable arms . granted that this is heavy but the added weight is there because this thing is built like a tank .in addition to being rock solid the parts mate perfectly with no slop in tolerances . the support arms slide into the base with no friction or excess movement and the height adjustment has three nicely spaced positions . you merely pull back on the spring loaded knobs to release the safety pins that engage the arms for position . once you line up the holes release the knobs and the pins solidly engage and hold the amp in place .my only complaint and it is more of a wish is the tilt of the stand is at a fixed angle . i would love it if i could adjust that too but i am sure that it would drive up the price of the stand . one final note these significantly increase the footprint of an amp on stage . specifically it increases the depth dimension by nearly of my frontman r although the difference in length is nominal . i mention this so you can factor that in if you normally play small venues with cramped stages .overall this is an excellent stand and one that is stable and heavy duty . at the current price at the time of this review it s a bargain .i have mine attached to one of the support arms on myon stage ks xx pro double x keyboard stand . while this attachment is designed for both square and round tube supports i was unable to use it with anon stage tier folding z keyboard standeven with the top tier removed . the reasons for the problem with the latter stand is the friction fitting on the attachment bar was too small for the oblong support tube and had it mated the height of the attachment bar would not have cleared the top of the keyboard .when attached to theon stage ks xx pro double x keyboard standwith anon stage msa tb adjustable microphone boom blackattached to the top screw in post that perfectly mates with the boom this attachment bar boom combination easily clears the height of either keyboard i use aroland rd nx digital stage pianoor aroland v combo key stage keyboard .bottom line make sure your stand can accommodate this attachment bar according to the manufacturer it will work with most x style stands and carefully measure the height of the top of your keyboard from the center of the support arm to which this attachment bar will be inserted . the total height of the attachment bar after insertion is approximately . . if your keyboard is still too high for the attachment bar boom or other mic holder to clear you can gain an additional with ashure a x mic mount extension tube .needed a stand to lift my pa mixer off the floor for safety and ease of use . for this is a sturdy little unit and collapses nicely for transportation . but it is a definite tipping risk if used at anything higher than the lowest height setting .i took the lead from reviewer w . jones and removed the upper brackets and inserted them with the longest bars horizontal instead of vertical and although my amp was more stable i still didn t feel it was stable enough to set it on the highest setting . i am using at the lowest height and it is stable but i highly recommend a heavy sandbag on the back if any other height setting is used .i give four stars for great value at will suit my needs very well .
this is one of the quietest mixers i ve ever used . the range of adjustability is excellent . channels fill up quickly but i ve mixed at a time and nearly no noise at least i don t hear any .i ve read its not really complete isolated but it does the job . i didn t realise how much noise my one spot was adding . i a b them both one after the other and it truly was quieter . the only problem i have is my tc helicon takes volts input but ma . this pedal only supplies ma so the pedal didn t work in the volt slit . luckily however it does work plugged into the volt ma spot so im using it there . everything else in the other volt ma slots .it s a lot quieter now . i recommend trying it and saving some cash .the device itself is difficult to read in bright light .my first one arrived not working at all .the second one arrived with a low battery . what ? after three days the battery goes out .i would have returned it but lost it because it doesn t adhere to the headstock very well . you ve been warned .
this product works fine but please keep your expectations reasonable .peat is used to soften the water and lower ph . it does so by reducing carbonate hardness . this is the water s buffering capacity . once the carbonate hardness has been lowered the ph will start to drop . the buffering capacity is the water s resistance to ph drops . to drop the ph you first have to lower the resistance .peat may not work for you if your tap water is very hard . a high gh usually accompanies a high kh carbonate hardness . if the water is too hard peat alone may not be enough to lower your ph . in my situation the gh out of the tap is approximately ppm ! with water this hard peat alone will not do the job . you would first need to remove most of the hardness . which you can do using several different methods . reverse osmosis ion exchange or using rain water .very effective safe for fish and takes only a small amount to work . buy graduated mil syringe so you can more accurately treat the water when doing water changes since ml can treat gallons . also make sure you use luke warm tap water so the temperature stays stable . i use an instant read waterproof thermometer which is designed for using in the kitchen and a graduated gallon bucket from h . d p . check the paint section .this is not hot enough for a uromastyx . it advertises as heat and ub light but then the instructions say you may need an additional heat source . even with additional heat not hot enough for a gallon for a uromastyx .
use this when washing your car glass will come out much more clear and no more water marks or swirl marks .i love this tire shine i use it every time i clean the cars . spray it on let it set and wipe off the excess . i do not use this as a spray and go or else it will leave a greasy film down the side of the car .i did not buy this at amazon cheaper elsewhere .this wash mitt was nice thick . holds a lotta water suds . . .could do the whole roof with one dip into the soapy water .you can see the dirt on the mitt as you wash so you know when to dip into a bucket of clean water before returning to the soap bucket for fresh suds .microfiber can really get the dirt off easily and the thickness doesn t scratch your paint .i bought a case of mitts from an online dealer for 
i have a cat and i actually use this to keep my cat off of things . works great for when my cat starts to scratch our couch or whatever . you just spray on whatever you want them to stop messing with and they run away .i am so tired of my neighbors mangy cat using my flower bed as it s personal toilet . not to mention the lazy thing doesn t even cover it s own turds ! it has been using my front and back yard as it s personal toilet and hunting all the wild birds that are attracted to our bird feeders . my dogs were also finding the cat turds and doing nasty things such as rolling on them . i have had enough and short of spraying the crap out of the cat with a water hose every time i see it in my yard it was a losing battle . this cat was either really dumb or defiant as heck . so i bought this unit . it seemed to work a bit but it also deters every other living thing from entering your yard like deer birds raccoons my own dogs etc . i happen to like watching the deer and wildlife without having to deal with this stupid cat and don t want my dogs to avoid the yard . so i am on the hunt for something else .i always keep these on hand because i have cats that pester me to go outside . naturally they kill things and pick up tapeworms . if i see one i give them a pill and its done . love this product ! ! !
this great product keeps all of my gas powered vehicles and equipment running great . i absolutely love it ! thank you !purchased several to keep the batteries charged on my classic cars . they work very well and the price is right ! highly recommended .bought this to charge maintain spare batteries not in my truck worked perfectly .great product would buy again .good service .fits battery tender .
worked well for adjusting valves on my honda accord . price was right and they had all the standard sizes which are close enough to the metric mm is the correct size for my jetta tdi oil cap and this fits perfectly .it s also fairly low profile another plus .this sunshade is easy to use and folds up to a nice compact size that fits under my seat well . it s a quite large size so is made for an suv or car that has a large windshield like my toyota prius . while it doesn t fit the prius perfectly it s the closest size to being perfect .at this price i have no complaints with this and can recommend it .
the table was a little larger but cutting it to leave a space in the center of each length works great . the triplets climb all over the living and always come back to the table to play . it looks good and you don t even notice its there .this net does what it says . i don t really like that you have to screw into the railing but a child s safety is way more important . it was also a little wonky to size down the length . i wouldn t say it s too stylish either but a person would be hard pressed to find a stylish railing guard . at the end of the day it does what it says and keeps the kid from falling though the railing .the softness of this cover makes up for the fact that you have to stretch it a bit to fit your changing pad . at least once you have it on you know that it s a snug fit and won t pop off !
i use this for a gallon as my hob filter and a gallon under gravel filter and between the two the water stays crystal .i bought the mini size to use on a gallon beta tank . it works well . for an especially thorough vacuuming i have to re add water and siphon again but it works perfectly for the usual water change and light vacuum . i expect the mini size vacuum would work well for tanks around gallons . the tubing is a few feet long just enough to safely fill into a bucket on the floor from a tank on top of a bookcase . the shake to start siphon worked fine even shaking vertically in the gallon rectangular tank .i have an unusual use case for this pump . i have four fish tanks with tropical fish . cleaning them can be a chore . i prepare water in a gallon container add chlorine killer adjust ph heat water in winter . after using the gravel vac to remove about half of the water i was using a small three quart bucket to tote water to refill the tanks . not too bad for gallon tank but with a gallon tank it s a lot of toting . and bending over . my back was not too happy doing this . so i got a ft of clear tubing and this pump . i drop the pump into the bucket and just sit and watch while the pump does all the work ! i purchased this pump because i needed to pump the water from floor level to about . feet and this model was rated for that level . my large gallon tank fills in minutes which is just right . i don t use this pump every day but it has been doing it s job flawlessly for almost three years and it is still working well pumping water uphill . this was an economical way to fill my fish tanks and i m very happy with it .
i bought this gate because the reviews were generally good and the price was better than many gates plus it included two extensions one and one . i am using it as a puppy gate . the height is so i don t expect a beagle to be able to jump it but at the same time i think my cat would find it easy to escape from the dog . hopefully i can teach her to jump it .the doorways i am trying to fit are so without the extensions the tension bolts do have to come almost all the way out to fit in the doorway . despite that it seems to be sturdy enough that a beagle cannot push it down and i have shook it and wiggled it myself without it moving much but we ll see . i get my puppy in a few days .it looks pretty nice and was easy enough to install with the little wrench that comes with it . one of the bottom tension bolts is a little tilted though bringing down the stability but i have a suspicion our doorway is not perfectly parallel . i may have to put something there to even it out . it comes with wall mounts adhesive pads to place them and screws with wall anchors to secure them which are required if you use it at the top of stairs which i won t be .not as cheap looking as a lot of baby gates and matches our white trim well . it s all white which i favored over having a large gray contraption on the top or bottom of the gate . having it in front of the laundry room matches rather well actually .i don t have a problem with the door width or the one handed operation . the opening is about but there is a door stopper that sticks out a bit making it . this is removable making the gate swing open both ways . i don t have a problem with the width as i am and lbs . as far as vacuuming you re going to have to lift the vacuum because there is a floor bar . god forbid people do a little work to vacuum the room on the other side of the gate !unfortunately the box arrived in awful condition so i thought the gate might be damaged . i ordered the gate from amazon . it seems the gate was sitting in a warehouse for a very long time because the little wrench it comes with to tighten the tension bolts was rusted or otherwise oxidized in places . that doesn t affect it s functionality at all though . the box and gate though are dusty and a little dirty . the box was taped shut probably for shipping but i am torn between thinking the gate was returned or just forgotten in some high humidity warehouse . if it was returned it may malfunction and i may have to return it myself .hope this is informative .update got my baby beagle and oddly enough he can squeeze through the gate at the bottom section near the wall when it arches away a little bit to make room for baseboards . if my doorway was a little smaller he wouldn t be able to fit but as it is he can squeeze through and get at the cat food etc . i haven t let him since he discovered it and he will soon be too big to squeeze through .my cat on the other hand is so lazy . she will jump out of the laundry room over the gate but i have not yet witnessed her jump in to the laundry room to eat . my housemate says he s seen her do it twice though . it may have something to do with the wood floor going in and the tile going out .after trying different gates that all had high ratings on amazon this is my favorite . i turned my home into my own version of a baby gate showroom to figure out which one i wanted so here s my take on three different gates .i think they are all pretty good gates it just depends on your situation and what features you re looking for . the key features that ended up making a difference to me were the width of the gate opening and the latch mechanismkidco center gateway cost extensions gate is . tall fits . to . doorway width bar to step over gate opening has the widest

the handle and lift the gate over a little ledge to open it and walk thru . i figure this will absolutely be the hardest one for my little one to figure out . this gate has the most adjustable widths and therefore would probably be the strongest in most door widths . the gate has about . pieces on the ends that you can use or not with the optional extensions more . spindles as additions per box to provide the most width flexibility . because all the gates become weaker if the posts are extended too much this one seems the sturdiest in my doorways . ie . if the gate says it fits up to and your door opening is . it won t seem as sturdy as if the doorway was . it doesn t have its brand name printed on it anywhere a plus in my book so it s totally white . it has the lowest bar across the floor that you have to step over at only high seems less of a tripping risk . this is the one that has the highest rating from consumer reports . child safety gates unfortunately it also is the most expensive of the bunch at about any extensions you need . i do have to say that this one had the most confusing directions but you can still figure it out ok none of them took longer than minutes to

use with mitten and warm to hot water following a good high pressure hose down . let it sit a minute on surface then wipe with soapy mitten . hose off . i use very warm to hot water with very little of this concentrated soap . always wash when your car surface is as cool as you can get it in the warm months . i have shade which works best but not essential .i use this grit guard to wax my car using bucket method . the grit guard works very well . if your car is very dirty using this guard would be a big plusgreat way to protect your gauge a must have extrasome reviewers have commented on this being difficult to fit .the leaflet recommends use of silicon spray however even easier with hot water . bowl of hot not boiling but hot leave the cover sitting in the hot water for a good minutes . rub a few splashes of water around the gauge . take the boot out of the water keep it hot and wet . it will then slip straight on just wipe off the water and then let it dry .job done !just remember to use some thread tape or sealer when re fitting the hose .
the quik interior detailer is a great product from meguiars . this provides the finish i like on my interior not too glossy but a nice clean matte finish .this interior detailer spray also has a nice smell to it . safe for all surfaces vinyl leather plastic chrome navigation entertainment consoles and lcd screens .doesn t add too much of a shine on the surfaces you apply it on its just right and leaves a clean streak free finish . i use this on the non leather surfaces in my car and on the black trim on the outside of my carhas some cleaning power to it but nothing like an all purpose cleaner . leaves a semi glossy appearance behind . not too glossy but not matte . it s been about a month and it s still on my dash .
fits all avent toxic plastic bottles and the non toxic sportster magic cups . does not fit via one of the non toxic plastic bottles avent has .i bought this item at a local specialty store and the clerk assured me the item was bpa free . when i got it home and opened it i saw the dreaded recycle code on the white part . i contacted baby bjorn to clarify . here is what they said babybj ouml rn and plastic safety when it comes to the material used in the production of our products we put significant effort into finding materials that meet our high standards of quality and safety . to guarantee the safety of our plastic products all babybj ouml rn kitchen and bathroom products are tested by specialized technology resources str an independent global provider of quality assurance testing . all plastics used in the production of our kitchen products fulfill the demands of the european eec and the american fda standard for plastics and are classified as food safe . through testing all of our kitchen products have been designated pvc free phthalates free and lead free . recent studies by health organizations such as the national institute of health have raised concerns about the safety ofbisphenol a bpa in plastic products . bpa is an industrial chemical that is used to manufacture polycarbonate plastic .polycarbonate plastic is the plastic that has caused considerable recent controversy because of its use in baby bottlemanufacturing and because it has been proven to leach bpa . polycarbonate plastic is not used in the production of any babybj ouml rn baby products and all babybj ouml rn products with a plastic component are bpa free . more specifically the babybj ouml rn plate is made of abs acrylonitrile butadiene styrene plastic which is certified bpafree . while both polycarbonate and abs along with other plastics have a recycling designation of there is no knownhealth risk associated with abs . i decided to keep it and see how it goes even though i prefer using glass or stainless steel items . i like that this one is not made in china like so many things tend to be .as soon as i opened the box i could tell by the voc s that this playard was treated with chemicals . i called graco to confirm that it is indeed treated with fire retardants . in addition some of the characters on the side panels contain vinyl . . .like the entire face of the sun is pvc . why would you let your child play let alone sleep in this toxic chemical stew . i called joovy about their room playard . it s the same size but quite a bit more expensive . the representative told me it was not treated with fire retardants . definitely worth it to pay the extra knowing my children won t be exposed to harmful chemicals .
oxford decoflex black x x inch desktop file amazing i have one already and purchased two more . they fit nicely side by side in a standard size bookcase as well as within the drawer of the pottery barn bedford file cabinet .thought it would be a little bigger or thicker did not see the dimension on the description . this does do the job as they are sharp and we use these to open boxes .for everyone else looking for the dimension they are as follows each cutter measures inches x inches x less than inch thick weighs . oza little longer than a stick of gum . juicy fruit is my fav .perfect size for hanging lightweight objects . wide and just thick this is ideal for office projects like securing whiteboards or wall mounted file pockets like these rubbermaid three pocket file folder organizer plastic x . x . inches clear ros . no more cutting chunky doublestick tape down to size this is neat clean and easy . rated to hold up to pounds .
was able to secure a foot bookcase without any issues . screws were not a problem . always possible for a long screw to break just drill a pilot hole . straps seemed sturdy . if you want them flush to the wall you need to install the wall piece well below the piece attached to the unit several inches . easy to unscrew the existing door jam and screw this one in it s place they even provide a screw . one piece so kids can t pull off the tip of the door jam and potentially choke .i installed two of these in about an hour . it would have been easier with two people the hole punchers included aren t great but the get the job done . the guard covered most of my railing from the base up to about an inch from the top rail . if you are going to cover a long section ft it can be difficult to get the full length to stay flat . what i did was punch a hole along the top every feet and used a zip tie pulled through the hole over the top rail to hang the sheet of plastic making sure the sheet was level and pulled tight horizontally . then i went to the bottom and every third vertical pole i punched a hole on either side of the pole as far in as the hole punch would reach and zip tied the sheet to the pole . then i cut the top zip ties and slid the plastic sheet down so that it rested level on the bottom and punched holes along the top a the same intervals at the bottom . two holes every third pole and zip tied around the pole . they supply plenty of zip ties so you can afford to make a few mistakes . the plastic is stiff but not so stiff that it breaks . the babies haven t defeated it yet .
nicely made comb . i like the clip ring on the end and made of stainless steel will make this product last .kali the mutt loves this bowl . she s kind of picky about drinking vessels . but she loves this one .we take it to the beach with a gallon sport bottle thing . the bowl fits in the side pouch like it was made for it .easy to clean .these are one of the most popular treats we ever purchased . i like that this product is american made . the pieces are lightweight cubes and odor free .
be aware this product does not fit all prince lionheart brand wipe warmer containers . i have the premium pl wipe warmer and it does not fit ! if you plan to use it to hold normal plastic container of wipes then you re fine .i bought this at babies r us . it did not fit my rail . it says it fits most standard rails but doesn t give any measurements . how are you supposed to know if it will fit unless you purchase it ? what a pain .i got this for my son s room and it would be fine except that most kid stuff has larger plugs that do not fit inside for example for the wipes warmer . if you are plugging in standard sizes only it should work great . we ended up not using it .
it s my first and i absolutely love it ! yup it makes an audible bang when you use it but that s the power of a good unit i can imagine how if they tried to make it quieter how it simply wouldn t go thru the paper very well . nope this unit is fantastic just like it is .i don t expect highlighters to be super florescent but these don t even make an attempt . green and blue are way to dark and make the highlighted text difficult to read .it came in a square box with minimal assembly required . in fact you just need to attach the top flat portion of the scale and you are ready to go . battery is no included so you have to provide your own type c batteries you will need . i found it hard to remove the cover of the battery compartment but nothing to fuss about . you can use an ac adapter but you will have to buy it separatelyto tell you the truth the first thing i notice is how cheap the product looks . mine came in silver i probably would prefer the black . yet there is no sure way what color you will get . what i really like about it is the simplicity of the operation its functionality and its minimalistic design . there are only buttons on the front on off hold will hold the result for minutes tare will deduct the weight of the container if you use one very useful the other adjustment is located on the right side which cycle the units in to metric and differrent amounts .one other thing that is very practical is the detacheable faceplate . if you have a big box you will most likely cover the digital display which will require you to kneel to peek the display under the box . the faceplate can be extended outward with a spiral cord like the one you see on the older type of analog telephones .display is backlit . lb capacity . made in china .
mr miyagi couldn t have said it any better .robust compact unit which i use with a fender rumble . plenty of lead so i can position it where i need it and thank heavens for duct tape .i don t often capo my guitar . when i do i need something that goes on quickly and is firm on the neck . you can t get better than this .the instructions could be written much better but i really like having one of these in fact i ll probably get a second one to tie to the first one so i can include more instruments .i guarantee if you get one of these you ll have a hard time leaving it alone . you can even work it into your live performances .
i was excited to get this product and use my electric guitar with garageband .this product plugs into the usb port and the guitar plugs into the port the product specs does not show or say plug port .my product has an orange usb light instead of a blue one . the support people at behringer tell me that they changed the color to match their logo sounds like bs to me .the problem i had and the reason i bought this is that i tried plugging my guitar directly into the computer with a adapter chord . it works but the levels are too low . when i received this i was hopeful that the levels would be higher and they are but not by much . it is a step up from the adapter but far from professional . i d say the level is beginner intro level sound and quality .i bought a like new product describing faded or damaged packaging . when it arrived the pkg box was dented i don t care and product looked new inside . but all the instructions described a blue usb light and cd of driver and recording software which this did not come with . behringer gave me a link to download . i assure you it s crapware and beware . for the mac garageband is far better and easier to use .rock out !five stars because it works on my digitech gnx guitar processor which requires volts and about milli amps . this has an output of milli amps . for electronics the voltage has to be correct . but an appliance will only draw as many amps current as it needs . so this adapter is coasting when used with the guitar processor and can be used with other devices that draw up to the mamps . just be sure your v device doesn t require more than the ma this can deliver . but it s a power adapter i cannot be in love with a power adapter .i bought this product for only one reason i have several amps that are not guitar amps but stereo or pa type clean high powered two channels that i want to use as guitar amps either as the primary or backup . this tube modeler acts first as a pre amp and then adds gain volume control crunch whatever to the non guitar amps to make them sound like guitar amps . i don t really care what tube amps it models or what mic placement i just want the guitar amp sound and style . i also use it in front of a behringer ultra g di box so that the di box splits the signal coming from the tm and sends half to my non guitar amps and guitar speakers on stage and the other half to the house pa . i don t think that many people would do this .the sound you get out of this box is affected by what amp and kind of amp you are driving with it and also what kind of speakers that amp is driving . the acoustics of the space you are playing in also affects the sound but i ve used this box with all of its settings driving pa amps home stereo amps bass amps and guitar amps all of which drove pa speakers bass speakers and eminence commonwealth guitar speakers all in the same acoustic space . each combination of amp and speaker with all settings on the box held constant sound different some more like guitar amps and speakers some not . as i said i don t really care about what tube amp is being modeled only that i get an authentic guitar and speaker sound out of the box . it works for me .i read reviews that say that this is a digital knockoff of the analog sansamp gt and based on its performance so far it has served as kind of like a cheap preview of what the sansamp can do . i would consider getting the gt in the future but for now this product is for me the poor man s tube amp .
it does as advertised . fit perfect on my car and at a fraction of the price the big box stores want to charge for so called upgraded features . these are all you need to keep your stems sealed . just remember to keep your tires at proper pressure to save money on gas .if this review helped you please let me know . thanks and happy shopping .changed engine oil on my equinox . just make sure it will work on your type of car . other wise it will give you pain like one of my friends . when it works it is super cool . not a single drop of oil on the floor .forget the rest . the others are only gimmicks compared to chevron techron . techron absolutely works . it will remove the corn fuel tarnish from your engine and keep those injection needles clean . yes i said tarnish . tarnish will build up in your engine fuel lines and injectors if you are not using techron . no it doesn t matter if you have a flex fuel automobile or not this tarnish is akin to pancake syrup and will eventually ruin your engine .
i lube my slideout and other seals and gaskets on my motorhome about twice a year . this works well on the gaskets of the storage compartments . be aware that it is really messy to spray on . you have to open your slides to access the seals and this comes out of the can similar to engine degreaser a foam that is messy . it gets on the painted surfaces and needs to be wiped off promptly . with a straw from another lube can i can spray it on the top gasket which is almost impossible to reach . for the side gaskets on the slideout i find that it is less messy to put on a plastic glove spray it in my hand and rub it on . works okay that way . if you are on the road and your slideout seal is sticking or binding try baby power . this is an effective product but thetford needs to change the nozzle to control the mess .this is a very useful rv product . some rv parks and locales require this type of product to preclude sewerage spills . it provides secondary protection in case the regular gray or black valve has a leak . this way when you take the cap off a possible leak is held back by this valve if it is properly closed . the unit locks on just like a regular sewer drain hose fitting . unlike some other brands this unit turns on its axis so that you can align the valve handle exactly where you need it .this is the high temp silicone gasket sealant for stopping leaks or forming a makeshift seal in a pinch if you can t find a gasket .
i thought i needed to buy the base separately when i bought my graco snuggleride car seat but you don t . the same base comes with the car seat . you only need this you have two cars with the latch system and don t want to move the base which is not hard to do from car to car . i should also say that you don t need to use any base at all with the carseat the carseat comes with instructions on how to seatbelt in just the carseat carrier part without the base which is what lost of people do in non latch cars anyway althoug the base can be seatbelted into not latch cars too . if you have a latch car it is safer to use the latch system and the base but the carseat can also be seatbelted in just like in the nonlatch cars . latch cars are cars built after .this car seat base does not work with graco snugride seats . just make sure you order the correct one .i like it it kept him secure . . . except when the strap slid along the seatbelt and unfastned it . this is more a flaw with the design of airplane seatbelts then the vest though .
i use this clamped to a table and it s a superb product . i have a tablet and a . touchpad and they both work very well in it . nice mount . great value . buy it .this product is exactly what they say it is .good material decent padding nice front pocket zippers function without issue .my acoustic cutaway fits nice and snug .i wanted a case mainly to protect my guitar at home and this works great .definately worth .this is a great gig bag for the money . it has more padding than i thought it would have has very strong construction and plenty of places to store stuff like sheet music and cables . the carry handle and shoulder straps are well padded and comfortable to use as well . it s even reasonably water proof handling the light rain shower well with zero leaks . for the money this is the best one i ve bought on amazon and will certainly buy it again in the future . highly recommended !
this is a generous roll of masking tape which as the description suggests can be used for a wide variety of purposes . the cream colored tape is thick and stable in securing its targets and i have been satisfied with its performance . its dimensions are m by m and it s made in canada .this is heavy weight paper with squares . note that the squares are not inch . they are mm which is slight less than . easy to draw on . the reinforced holes make this paper more likely to survive rough treatment in the field .excellent in all respects except for the size of the squares .ad it fits in my file cabinet correctly and dimensions were perfect . spacing is nice for binders and books . it does take a bit of elbow grease to get the little feet on the ends . they are rubbery plastic and its a super tight fit . great product though !
five stars because it works on my digitech gnx guitar processor which requires volts and about milli amps . this has an output of milli amps . for electronics the voltage has to be correct . but an appliance will only draw as many amps current as it needs . so this adapter is coasting when used with the guitar processor and can be used with other devices that draw up to the mamps . just be sure your v device doesn t require more than the ma this can deliver . but it s a power adapter i cannot be in love with a power adapter .its working great but it does not work in stereo . it is a mono adapter the stereo adapters are a little more expensive .this is an a pedalit s small and fits on a complex pedal board nicely it does one thing and it does that one thing perfectly . . .the mxr micro flanger works great with distortion or just turn down the effect level and speed up the rotation and it works beautifully on clean passagesif you want a flanger to do any more than that you re just goofing off mostly i need a subtle wash for flanger work and the mxr micro is perfect for that

this book holder is made of plastic and seems a little flimsy but so far it s holding up decently . the back stand uses two pieces and is adjustable . there are two tabs in the front which you can move forward and backward so that you can turn pages more easily or insert new books without fear of ruining a page . they are also a problem . i have found that they can pop out from use as they only have a fitted notch keeping them in place at the bottom of the unit .i can also see how a book larger than inches in thickness can be an issue as the depth of the base is roughly an inch deep . i ve not yet had to work with this i use it for typing up class notes from notebooks at this time with a book of that size but i can picture my coffee cup coming into play if i ever use it with a book of that size .i use these in my cookbooks to mark my favorite recipes or some i want to try ! they are removable so i can use them over and over . you can also write on them great little flags !i do appreciate the fact that each marker has an eraser built into the cap . you don t realize how convenient that is until you have it . i use this with a small x whiteboard that i carry around when i help my kid with his homework . the size is perfect for that whiteboard . also the cap has a magnet on one side so you can hang the markers on the whiteboard when not in use .
i purchased this item over the boppy pillow because of the velcro seat wrap . it keeps my baby in place without him sliding downwards which i have witnessed with other babies using the boppy pillow . boppy pillow covers can used with this leachco pillow . when my baby is too big for the velcro seat wrap i will be using boppy pillow covers on this pillow . the lack of the removable cover is a disadvantage for cleaning purposes .this mattress pad is soft but not too cushiony . also the waterproof element is located inside the pad so you don t have too much of the annoying plastic vinyl rubbing sound or feel . the pad has protected our mattress from many a baby attack .the pillow provides decent support for the baby while feeding but only allows for spot cleaning . and let s face it . spilled milk and spit up need to be thoroughly washed from the material . i am going to have to buy a washable cover . might as well have bought a slightly more expensive pillow .
the fisher price sounds n lights monitor offers some good qualities that make it a worthwhile addition to the household with infants and young toddlers . its best feature is its ability to pick up and transmit even the slightest sounds . any slight noise in the babies room like a slight cough or even a deep breath is detected by the transmitter and sent to the receiver . depending on how loud the volume is turned up concerned parents will be able to hear these and other sounds with ease .sounds are most important but the fisher price sounds n lights monitor also offers lights to let parents know about the activities taking place . the lights indicate the intensity of the noise and they work even if the volume is turned completely off . the arcs of red light on the fisher price sounds n lights monitor include four arcs and they light up based on the intensity of the noise . they aren t absolutely necessary but they are good for those who would rather monitor with their eyes as opposed to ears .does the fisher price sounds n lights monitor have any drawbacks ? yes it certainly does and the most annoying among them is the static . no matter how little activity is going on within the vicinity of the transmitter you still get static and it is especially loud if the volume control is turned too high . sometimes you can reposition the receiver and or transmitter of the fisher price sounds n lights monitor and reduce the static . changing the channel can also help . but you can t do much with the antennae and there is almost no way to get completely static free reception .another potential problem with this monitor is its ability to sometimes pickup the sounds from other people in the neighborhood . if someone else is using a baby monitor or even if they are just talking on the phone the fisher price sounds n lights monitor might end up receiving some of the sounds . this can be quite shocking when it happens the first time . you will think there is someone in your babies room when in reality the sounds are coming from the neighbors .taken as a whole however the fisher price sounds n lights monitor is a good monitor for new parents and while it doesn t offer anything special it gets the job done for minimal cost . there are certainly better monitors out there but this monitor completes its task without doing too much damage to the pocketbook .this monitor is great . i really like the features that it offers . not only does it have lights that light up when baby cries it can also vibrate if you have that option turned on when baby cries so you ll know even while running the vacuum . i like how the battery on the parents unit is rechargeable all you have to do is plug it in . this monitor picks of up every sound which is great to have with a little one .the monitor has offered very clear reception and we even have to keep the volume low because the reception is so good . the nightlight feature is great as you can turn it on settle your baby and then leave the room the nightlight will turn off automatically after about minutes .
 .i get to extra copies from each cartridge .after the toner life end message appears it refuses to print even one more copy . offensive . . .until you show it who s in charge .remove the cartridge and find clear plastic port holes one on each side . the printer shines a light through these to decide when to shut you off . but it s too sudden and too early .cover one or both windows with a small piece of masking tape . you can put the tape on the outer drum unit holes if you prefer . i get about copies per cartridge instead of .i really like brother printers now that i have taught them some manners .to save even more money trysol corp non oem pack toner refill kit for use in brother tn toner cartridge . comments questions welcome i love my printer really . i very much appreciate being able to make large professional quality prints for a fraction of what labs used to charge back in the day . but please those figures are outrageously confusing and misleading ! it s hard to say exactly how long these cartridges last but prepared to start buying new ink after about prints .after going through of these i checked my counter and averaged them pages each ! actually it is a bit higher considering that is including the toner that comes with it . note i am using the block the low toner sensor with black tape trick . also i switched to non oem toner carts and haven t noticed any problems just a savings of about each .
i love office supplies and anything that gets those lose papers off of my tables and counters . this corkboard is a perfect solution for items that i want to save but don t want to deal with right away .my last corkboard was actually made of cork whereas this high density cork fiberboard seems to be some time of manufactured cork that doesn t show pin holes . time will tell how well it holds up .this also came with two little plastic pieces called quick clips which slide into the frame and can hold papers . the most interesting thing about this corkboard was the fastening brackets .it comes with four large screws anchors and brackets . i had to read the directions twice before the measuring instructions sunk in . you can use the top and bottom edges of the board to create a line . then align the line on the bracket with the lines on the wall and make a circle or mark where you want to drill .then drill the anchor holes attach the brackets and snap in the board . it actually worked . attach the bottom brackets first before measuring and attaching the top brackets . if you follow the instructions this board will be flush with the wall and very stable . this is a nice product .first of all the handle is not installed you need to root around in the box for it . takes one second to put on .just got finished cutting out flashcards from cardstock of them so over cut and sheets of regular paper in half cuts . also tried it on photos .pros it easily cuts sheets of cardstock lb weight consistentlyraised edge makes it pretty easy to keep stacks of paper straight .it will cut slivers as small as mm wide off of sturdy paper photo paper or cardstock .easy to store it is pretty lightweight . with the green handle installed it is in including handle by in by . deep the handle part you can lock the arm in place .cons with regular paper it has a harder time with slivers it tends to smoosh the paper a bit .i wish it had labels across the top not just of inches and cm but where to align for cutting standard sheets in half for both long and short directions . i ended up marking these on it with a sharpie to speed up my project .this is not a product for use in a school or if you have to cut hundreds of sheets of paper every day . it is great for home use .these file folders are sturdy and colorful .they are intended for attaching papers via a metal buckle on the top . so you punch two holes in the top of a paper or stack of papers unfold the metal buckle put the points through the paper holes and flatten .each folder has two internal dividers .
meguiar s deep crystal line is meant as an inexpensive alternative to the more expensive meguiar s product lines . this liquid wax works very well and contains carnauba but is not their best product .this product is step in the deep crystal line and would be used after step wash and step polish . the product is applied by hand or dual action polisher then wiped off after it dries . very simple and effective .the look of this product is highly subjective but it does not have the clarity or longevity of other meguiar s waxes . it should also be noted that this product has been discontinued so don t get too addicted to it ! if you want a great carnauba wax from meguiar s look into gold class carnauba plus .i read all the other companies material on how well their products worked on rust . i had planned on using the por product but as with several other ones i was worried about how harsh and toxic they were . this product is water based no harsh fumes and cleans up with water ! so far i have used almost two bottles on a very rusty undercarriage . the product works fantastic isn t scary to handle and the finished results are beautiful . you have to recoat in about twenty min . for the coverage to even out . in hours it dries to a hard satin black finish which you can top coat . this product goes a long way for such a small bottle . a great buy !this product is more of a glaze than a swirl remover . while it does have some cutting ability it may not work well on new clear coat paint . if you use this product i recommend to top it off with a good quality wax or sealant such as meguiar s ultimate wax . paste or liquid 
if you don t have one of these you need to get one . all you have to do is put it in the can stick the open end in the tank and shake the tube and the gas goes in the tank . no mess no hassel . i got four of them for all my atv motorcycles jet skis and boats . works great !works like a dream ! no robin williams rv episodes for me ! i should have bought one of these earlier it would have saved me some time flushing my tank out . when i don t have a long line behind me at the dump station i can almost get the blackwater tank clear . it only takes or flushes to get it good enuff .my experience one of the things i really like about this funnel is how long it is . it can literally reach down inside an automotive engine with ease so that i can pour new oil into the crankcase without getting it all over the engine which could cause an oil fire !the bottom of the funnel is narrow for the first inches . which means i can get it into a tractor dipstick tube and effortlessly add oil . because of the total length of the funnel i am able to add more oil at a time without worrying about spilling out of the funnel .because of this same feature i am able to put it through the filler hole of a vehicle gas tank and it will stay there and then i can pickup my gas can and add a couple gallons of gas to the tank .other uses here is another use many of you may have not thought of . with a small mower to drain the oil all you have to do is tip the mower to its side and let it drain into a pan . however you can t do this with a tractor because the engine is mounted to the tractor frame . so i cant get a pan under the frame because there is my right side wheel in the way . after i attach my drain tube to the drain valve on my engine i then take the super funnel and place the tube into it and then the funnel into the oil pan . there you go draining made simple !conclusion though i had to spend more then i would for any regular funnel it is well worth the cost i spent on it when i consider what uses i can get out of it . like i said tiny funnels are great for small things but for larger engines you need to get serious . i just love my super funnel and if you buy one you will too ! out of 
i use it on every wash that i do .if your a car guy and keep your vehicles nice this is a great product .if your working on a vehicle that has been abused it may take you two or three times to get the wheels looking good .you may have to scrub the wheels by hand to clean off the real dirty areas and possibly use tar and or bug remover to get them nice and clean .but once you do that from there in all you need to do is wash the wheels down spray the wheel cleaner on and let it sit for a few minutes and pressure wash it off . no need to hand wash .and the wheels look really nice .excellent product cleans very well sometimes you need to use a microfiber brush but even with the brush the dirt becomes very loose and easy to remove .pros cleans very well safe with no complications non acidiccons bottle enough for barley to finish on time clean you need at least two bottles to finish the job well including the wheels behind the spokes thats i why i don t give it afullmark .this product is an effective way to remove dust and pollen in between car washes . i have used it for several years without any problems and recently bought a new one to replace the one that got ruined in hurricane irene this past summer my garage was flooded . here is why i like it . this cleans without harming the car finish or leaving streaks .important follow the directions to place this on newspaper for hours before first use . that is to get rid of excess wax that can cause streaking . . this covers a large area so the time to clean is reduced . . this is easy to clean just shake it out and works great no matter how dirty it gets . . this is well made and durable .note this is not a substitute for going to a car wash or using other cleaners . it does nothing for example to remove water spots or bird droppings . it also does nothing to give your car the shine that only wax can do . but it is a great way to maintain your car in between car washes .
this ergotron neo flex lcd stand is terrific ! i wanted a stand to rotate my samsung bw lcd monitor to portrait mode since the monitor only comes with a short landscape only stand . all of the rave reviews on amazon are correct . this is the stand to get if you want to rotate a or smaller lcd monitor . i don t know if it can go high enough to rotate a monitor since the corner is a close fit when rotating my monitor .for those wanting a full description of this stand i ll try to describe all of its features .the base is round for a reason . it can rotate horizontally like a lazy susan on bearings ! the base attaches to the vertical stand using two phillips machine screws . the frames are some kind of cast metal so they are very strong . the metal frame is covered with plastic for cosmetic reasons and the finish of the plastic is very nice . the base is . in diameter and is very stable . there is no tippness to the base at all .the stand s mounting plate attaches to the back of the monitor using phillips machine screws or thumbscrews all of which are included . there are two sets of mounting holes in a square pattern . one set is a tad shy of square and the other is a tad shy of square . actually metric measurements i think . the holes lined up perfectly with the screw holes on the back of the bw .the screen can be raised up and down via the spring loaded mounting plate so it is easy to do the height adjustments . there is a screw adjuster to compensate for different weight monitors but the adjustment was about right for the bw out of the box . in either landscape or portrait modes i m able to get the bottom of my monitor about . above the table surface . good for folks who wear bifocal glasses who want their monitors low .the mounting plate pivots degrees clockwise only from landscape to portrait . there are stops at each end so it is easy to rotate degrees without having to play with the rotation . it takes little effort to rotate the screen . when rotating the screen the screen has to be raised to clear the corner over the circular base . then lowered again for comfortable portrait mode viewing . but the spring loaded height adjustment makes the entire process very easy .there is a forward backward tilt adjustment so you can get the surface of the monitor flat to your viewing angle . you can easily turn the monitor like a lazy susan to get the monitor flat to your viewing angle . in a nut shell every conceivable adjustment angle is covered .if you need to rotate your lcd monitor to portrait mode this is the stand to buy . i can t think of any stand that even comes close to this one for the selling price .i installed these on two lcd monitors a viewsonic and dell . the unit is very easy to assemble . you can instantly change the height angle and rotation of the monitors without having to turn any set screws . you just hold the screen and move it to whatever position desired . there are various pieces of hardware supplied to fit many monitor types .the allsop metal art monitor stand is a really great sturdy flat screen monitor holder that can fit an entire toshiba laptop under it !
when used regularly it seems to do a good job . my dog does not get fleas or ticks and she does go outsideit s a sturdy toy and my lb dog can carry it around . he can chew as often as he likes and it doesn t seem to wear down .well made . does a good job you dont have a bag laying around ! !if you have a dog buy one !
i just received my blue radius shock mount and i was immediately floored by the the size and looks of the unit . it reminds me a set piece from fritz lang s metropolis the rings around saturn or something built by tesla . it s a beautiful thing certain to impress anyone who might sit in front of it to be recorded . certainly beats the homemade inch pvc pipe and bungee cord shock mount i previously had made and my yeti mounted to . what is impressive about this mount is you have full and clear access to the the yeti s knob s mute switch and usb headphone plugs on the bottom of the mic whereas my homemade version gave me fits with knob access . once you screw the yeti into the machined shock mount base there are teflon or maybe white delrin washers which allow you to swivel the mic easily to access the back knobs or move it toward any position say a guest speaker with great ease . the build is hefty machined aluminum rings with stainless steel mounts and screws . the elastic suspension bands are not going to fly across the room as they do on most shock mounts because they are not threaded on hooks but securely fastened to brackets then the holding screws . the radius also allows you to mount the yeti on a boom stand upside down which i have always been told is the best way to mount a condenser type mic so dust and moisture spit does not build up near the capsules or internal electronics it just falls as gravity allows .does a shock mount make a difference in sound ? to my ears yes especially if you are recording into say a laptop on a table the fans and hard drive are going to vibrate coloring your overall sound with unwanted hum . although the mic stand the yeti comes with does an o .k . job of dampening vibration it is not going to give you as much isolation as the radius which will be noticed when the gain controls are turned up . there is also the science of unwanted resonance from instruments rooms or cabs vibrating your stands that s why you see most professional studios using shock mounts you just get a cleaner sound . in a test the radius works like a charm even from pounding on my mixing desk . a . earthquake is not going to cause any vibration .on the down side just to play devils advocate the radius is huge and may nor be suitable for tight spots or portability . that said the yeti is also a big microphone and once mounted may add six inches to the overall space you will need to use this setup properly . next when you un mount the yeti from it s built in stand you are going to have gaping screw holes in the side of the mic . i fixed that by screwing the old yeti stand screws back into the holes which actually looks kind of neat to me . to some maybe it will look like bolts in the frankenstein monsters neck but i think it all fits together . next smaller base microphone stands will want to tip either angle the yeti plus radius back or get a bigger stand this is the one i have and would highly reccomend thesamson samd md desktop mic stand . lastly this mount will only work as far as i can see with a blue yeti or blue yeti pro microphone maybe some other mics will work but not likely .in conclusion the radius is an easy set up works great and makes a yeti look retro futuristic sexy ! yeah it actually looks really cool like a spaceship blasting off or landing take your pick i know people coming into my studio are going to say what the heck is that and where can i get one ! ? i may tease and say it s and award or art piece .addendum if you thread another shock mount into the radius you get double protection . it also looks great to talent in your studio . over kill or uber cool you decide . see pictures .i actually have five of these for the various instruments mostly bass guitars but also an acoustic and a solid body electric .when mounted properly to studs the only way i have mounted these they are very very solid . while in a nice package with instructions and hardware for wall board fasteners i used longish brass wood screws to studs for appearance and strength . you do see the ends of the screws used after install is complete and to me a brass screw looks great with this flat black model .the cc model this one works well with any kind of guitar including bass or acoustic . there are variants for other instruments but a relatively wide range will be held securely by this unit . the yoke width is adjustable and a combination of slope and two keeper rings prevent the instrument from coming off the holder .recommended . . .but do consider you means of mounting carefully .the good inexpensivecontains most of the hardware you need drum mounts etc .works with or has a carrying casethe kick mic has a good low frequency responsethe bad has locking clasps with included keys that are too big for the key holes .does not contain any of the cabling and you will easily spend as much on that as you did on the microphonesno instructions on how to use the mounts or little things like you can use plyers to remove the adapters from the mountskick mic needs a mic stand one is not providedthe ugly the two condenser microphones are incredibly sensitive but at the cost of an incredibly high noise floor . there is a ton of hiss at any level setting and it will make your recording sound like a casette tape unless you eq out all of the highs on the condensers to kill the hissssss .
it makes the water safe for my fish . there is a lot in there for what you pay for . only problem is i have a . gallon tank as well . so i need to get a dropper for this tank . it s made for gallon tanks . but overall it s very nice .this canister filter rena filstar xp for freshwater is very nice great for my gallon aquarium ! !this filer cleaned my gallon aquarium very fast over night ! also i like how is so very quite better of my old filer . i have had aquariums for years so i really like rena aquariums for my old aquarium .thanks so much rena ! ! because this rena xp is great and easy to put into the aquariums !my local fish stores swears by this i don t have a reef tank but a freshwater tank . fits in my eheim canister filter i have the small pro alongside the biomedia . i run a pretty intense tank with lots of fertilization high light co lots of food many plecos and a fair amount of mulm and organic debris from the large number of live plants . this helps keep my water clear and in balance . i can t say exactly how much this contributes to the health of my tank but i will continue to use it as a safety net . i also ran purigen for a while but it was getting expensive given the size of my tank so i m saving the purigen for my smaller tanks that also have a discoloration issue from the driftwood and instead use chemi pure in my larger display tank .
this aquaclear is also the same filter included with fluval edge tank and is very quiet and does it job cleaning the tank .i bought ac for my hospital tank and cleans it as it should .what i like about aquaclears compared to other hang on the back filters is that you don t need to keep on buying filter cartridges . the included foam and ceramic filter should last you a couple of years . just wash them gently form the water from your tank or water treated with antichlorine stuff to preserve the beneficial bacteria .enough said highly recommended !the filter max iii pre filter was a great buy . i use it as a pre filter on my aqueon hob filter . the filter max helps keep the filter clean and allows me to extent the period of time between filter rinses and cartridge changes . this in turn really lets the biological filtration establish itself both in the filter and on the sponge .i like the filter max so much that i have purchased another for my penguin . . .the only challenge with that will be matching the round pre filter to the rectangular intake on the hob filter . . .but i will figure it out !i love this filter so much i put one on every tank . i use it in conjunction with my other filters as a daily filter and should i need to i can place the polishing unit in it to give the water that extra clear appearance or to rid the tank of parasites should that ever occur .
i should have gotten the honda cap . this fits ok but the screws are not captured in the cap . with the original cap the screws cannot fall out . considering the position of the screws when mounting this captured screws are an advantage .there are two horns not one . one is hz and the other one is hz .piaa automotive sports horn hz the are exact fits on the mounts as the oem horns and use the same bolts . a inch drive ratchet and a mm socket is needed to remove and install the bolt . they came with grounding leads with ring spade lugs that mounted readily under the existing m bolts on the radiator supports . all you need is a mm socket .the two wiring harness leads are too short to connect the horns . two wire tie mounts hold the harness to the aluminum bumper reinforcement . you can cut off the ties and use the oem harness to connect the horns but i chose not to . i prefer not to cut off the oem connector blocks .i made two pigtail extensions out of gauge black primary wire inches long . one end needs a inch wide exposed male quick disconnect . the other end needs an insulated female inch quick disconnect terminal . since i used gauge wire i used the red coded ones .the exposed male connector slides into the oem horn connector perfectly . the female one clips easily onto the positive terminal of each horn .the horns how have a weather shield on the apertures .best thing to my surprise is that they appear to be very high quality and made in japan .also nice is that they need no modification to the horn relay or circuit .the picture is slightly misleading . this is only the mounting bracket it does not come with any wiring . but is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a wire flat cable . the bracket is flat on one side and curved on the other . the curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch . the connector on the end of my t connector fits well and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket . it sure beets having the connector flopping around !
basically this case is very sharp looking made with good quality materials . the inside of the one i received was grey fur . the case would probably take a beating over time but its not a skb case . nice enough that i wouldn t check it at the airport . survived a trip in a moving van from philly to boston .would definitely recommended if you need a case that your les paul fits very snugly and safely into .this is an excellent gig bag . plenty of compartments for all of your accessories . well padded and has enough carrying options . a good buy .when i was looking for a bass case i just wanted something that was not too expensive and would protect my bass . this fits the bill perfectly . it s not really a case that is meant for heavy travel like checking it a the airport but it definitely will take good care of your bass during normal travel . and the internal compartment is really nice for storing straps cables strings etc . for the price this is an excellent case .
this is a great product it does work very well . my vets assistant told me if i buy frontline from amazon i am not getting a legit product as it is only sold to vets . while it is true it is only sold to vets . .it is not true that the vets office is the only place you can get a legit product .i emailed merial and they confirmed i did indeed buy a legit product from amazon . go to the merial web site email them as i did and they will give you a phone number to call so you can verify whether or not you have a legit product .i am not saying don t be careful . . .please do . .but i buy frontline plus from amazon . .it works and it is legit .we have used frontline plus for seven years now and swear by it ! some other reviews said they received a product that was made outside the u .s . and the box numbers didn t match the batch numbers on the product . this was not the case for the ones they sent us . i am very happy with the swift shipping and quality of the product !i purchased because of the other reviews . i tried it and my fish love it . i will buy this product again . it arrived in a timely manner and was packaged well . the price was also fair .
i put these bottles in between the regular bottles and the dr . brown bottles . the vents i feel do help with the baby ingesting air but these bottles are no where close to competing with the dr . brown bottles . the downfall of the dr . brown bottles is the cleanup of them . these are much easier to clean .we purchased this bottle warmer for travel use . we have the full sized dr . brown bottle warmer but it s too big to carry along on short trips and vacations .pros inexpensive but not cheap . it s hard to find a functional bottle warmer in this price .sized perfectly for travel . great to use in hotels and or if you ll be staying with relatives .it will accommodate wide neck bottles . we had no problem warming dr . brown s wide neck oz bottles and similac s odd shaped bottles .heats up fast . average warming time for an oz bottle with oz formula is around minutes depending if it s room temperature or chilled .cons outside of bottles gets really hot to touch . be careful in lifting your bottles with your bare hands .no built in water reservoir . water has to be measured and poured with every use .warmer needs a cool down period of at least minutes with every use . it is not designed to warm multiple bottles .my favorite part about these bottles are the nipples . they are wide and a tad bit short and my babies latched wonderfully to these nipples . the slow flow nipple is very slow . but that s a good thing . most slow flow nipples drown my babies . the slow flow is great for breast milk . the medium flow nipple is great at about months with just formula no cereal . the fast flow nipple is amazing ! it works great on the dr browns bottles too vent aire nipples are my choice for dr browns bottles . cereal come through the fast flow nipple perfectly with no cutting of the nipple .these bottles are much easier to clean than dr brown s and they provide the same fluid flow as dr brown s without having to deal with the middle insert of the dr brown s .the cap on these bottles touches the top of the nipple and therefore the bottles do not leak while in the diaper bag . this is a major reason i love the bottles .two things i dislike about these bottles . you cannot mix four scoops of formula and oz of water in the bottle . there s no room to shake it all up . so i have to pre mix the formula and then pour into the bottles . dr brown s have more room in the bottles to accommodate all the water and powder . these bottles are crooked not straight so they are difficult to prop . with twins i had to prop bottles sometimes .mom of rn
the listing for this item can be confusing if you are not sure what stereo xlr is . stereo xlr is meant to be similar to your stereo headphones where left and right are separate unbalanced wires . this cable is configured to be a stereo unbalanced xlr to a stereo unbalanced trs cable . this item is not a mono balanced xlr to a stereo unbalanced mic cable .a little bit a soldering can fix this connector by moving the red wire from ping to pin with the white wire . pin then ties to pin with the ground wire .i bought this xlr splitter to split the lead vocal from foh to my monitor rack . used this way it worked great and i never had any problems with signal loss or power issues . i began using a transformer isolated xlr splitter after we started playing bigger venues and no longer use this splitter . my only issue with the hosa y splitter is that the cable length from the female connector to the male connectors is very short so short that it would cause the microphone cables to stick out from the mic stand when i plugged it into our lead singer s microphone . it would be great on a guitar mic or something that s close to the ground or horizontally placed but it looks a little funny coming off of a vertical microphone stand .i needed a way to boost the input of a wired lapel microphone coming from the preacher directly into my powered speakers . works great !
this tascam us usb audio interface is exactly what i was looking for to record from our wireless mic with xlr outputs directly to my pc video editing software . we professionally produce instructional videos and needed this for voice over work on existing footage . before getting this convenient little unit we had to record into a camcorder and then import it into the pc so this saves us a step when we only need to record audio . here are my observations plug and play connected to my pc via usb and was instantly recognized usb powered no external power needed a big plus when using my laptop good sound clean and clear input multiple inputs xlr mic rca stereo line and hi z guitarmisc xlr input is not powered not a problem for us includes audacity software but we did not need to load ithighly recommended !cfhi primarily use this as an usb adapter for my headphones so that i can connect convert the . mm headphone jack into my pc .the audio adapter is well built . it has a yellow led light that is solid when plugged into an usb port and blinks when there is a device that is connected to it through a . mm jack .installation was flawless . windows bit installed drivers immediately .no issues . no nonsense . simply works !this product has a mono microphone input and a stereo headphone output . it is meant for connecting a headset to a usb port . since the headset has a mono microphone this adapter works great . the drivers automatically install on microsoft operating systems . this product is great for using a soft phone or other communications program . the windows systems remembers volume settings each time it is connected . i imagine that you could use something other than a headset with this but it was mainly built for a headset . works seemless and great with a headset .
glad i went with the chrome and not the black one i hooked this one up to my gv motorcycle if you have just a little know how you can do it your self all you will need to go with this is a relay that does not come with it . you can get it on here or any part store i have made many people jump due to the sound of the horns loudness .fair price and does what it s supposed to do . it s handy for when you don t want to work directly at the car .good product for the cost . i am happy with them . they are basically hooks that go under the head rest . if your head rest doesn t detach this might be a problem . also they move around a lot so if you need something that doesn t move this wouldn t work for you .
this fantastically colored and designed mobile held my baby enthralled . the classical music was easy on my ears though i found i would hum the pieces over and over .once i wrangled the batteries in and screwed the cover shut installation was easy for my jenny lind style crib .i thought the remote was sort of silly . i just want to point out that you can get all three composer s music to play with the remote even though another reviewer had a problem with this . it s not very intuitive you have to press the bottom button on the remote .now here s where the review heads south . after about two months i started encountering problems with getting the mobile to play and spin . first the music developed a scary loud scratchy hum that made my baby cry . replacing the batteries fixed that problem . then i was unable to get the mobile to spin . the base plays if i remove the wand with the mobile . sometimes if i jiggle it just right the mobile will spin and play . but inevitably it stops again . very frustrating ! stars for design and music choice . star for very frustrating low quality .i love that you can mix and match sounds with this sound soother my girls like the womb sounds particularly . however this thing is not even close to being loud enough to qualify as white noise . you have to put the thing directly into an infant s crib making the cord a choking hazard in order for them to even hear it . if you are like me and need the white noise to keep your baby from waking up from other sounds in the house you need something a lot louder .sturdy toy fun to push all the buttons . sings diff mozart tunes and lights up . no assembly required just open the box and turn it on .
this hands free gate works when you step down on the foot paddle which causes a latch to open . you can then push the gate open with a hand or a knee . the gate is fairly easy to install a necessary slim wrench is included in the box and requires no screws or glue . the gate provides good protection . the bars on the gate are well spaced so even small infants shouldn t be able to crawl through . when properly installed it provides solid protection although important ! you should regularly check it to make sure it s securely affixed to the door frame . also over time the gate tends to bend a little so you should use the little wrench like tool to adjust it when necessary .in short a very good gate for keeping kids out of a certain room . but this is not designed and should never be used to guard the top of a stairway .i like the squishiness of the seat but after my son has been sitting there a while min . the rigid plastic base still cuts a ridge into his legs the seat squishes all the way down . i think once he gets more efficient at using the seat this will improve . the urine guard at the front is also a separate piece just tucked in between the seat and the base so when my son climbs on he sometimes knocks it out of place doesn t guard well then . i do like that it s a bendable rubber type material so it has some give when he scooches his behind over it . my dad had to fashion a filler block out of styrofoam attached with packing tape to the back of the seat because our toilet is oval so this potty seat slides back when my son sits down . the description said it works with round and oval seats . this is true it does fit but slides to the back of the toilet opening so my son s feet don t reach the stool and he gets scared . with the seat braced to the front it s fine . great colorful graphics ! warning i did almost lock myself inside his room once the first day i installed it . i had the gate handle in open position and swung out . but we closed the room door . the gate must have swung back towards his room door but with gate handle still up . i did not know that when the gate handle is up it blocks his regular room door handle it s a lever one . so i could not push down on the room door handle lever it s like if a chair was under it . luckily the gate has these small footholds which i remembered so i used a clothes hanger and stuck the hanger thru the gap under the room door and pushed the gate away from the door . . .phew we were able to get out . now i just always make sure the gate handle is always in down position even if not locked closed .but it does the job i wanted it to do . it is blocking off my son s nursery doorway .the clear panel gets kinda gross from hand grease i guess since my son s always putting his hands in his mouth . but easier to clean than rails i would say .handle is hard to open but that s a good thing for little curious minds . same with the latches that allow the gate to extend .i screwed the hinge side in and pressure mount the other side . i m not sure if i installed it wrong but the bottom bracket on the hinge side is not flush with the side of the doorway . the bracket is a little loose but the screws stay in place though . gate only came with spacers for the top bracket and not the bottom . why is that ? the screws are drilled as far as they can go in though so that is the only thing keeping that bracket in place .i like that it swings both ways . my son can climb up to stand but cannot climb over it because no rails and he s not tall enough . he pats his hands on it often and still stays in place so far . i installed it so that his real door can still close when not in use . when not in use i just keep the gate open and close the door .
fits my john deere lawn tractor which is model la and likely it fits all the l la and d series lower end john deere tractors . please post a comment if it does not and i ll update this reviewcurrently amazon says it does not fit my third generation miata nc but it doesthese filters come top in most online filter tests and i use them in almost all my carsworks great nice to have a second cable but the obd end of the cable is angled . in my case this cable won t work on my subaru outback . i would prefer the option of a straight obd connector . note that the angle connector works on my other four cars mazda honda dodge .works great . fairly easy swap . just be aware the front window regulators are the same on whether you have a suburban or tahoe or one of their gm family members . not so for the rear regulators . the full size suvs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones . the vehicle input feature amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference . the pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at but the vehicle id feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit . beware ! ! ! ! just so you know the dorman and fit the full size and the and fit the tahoe size vehicles .
like many here the case could be an inch bigger . for my ibanez i cut the bottom material along the edge against the side wall enough to take out the bottom foam and then put the material back . now mine closes without pressure on the bridge .unlike some other reviewers i have found no quality issues with mine it came symmetrically bent with a plastic pad that doesn t smell like anything it holds my harp exactly where it needs to be and is easy enough to remove all i need to do is loosen the bottom wingnut rotate the harp away from my mouth and lift the frame over my head .to change out harps bite down on your harp use your hands to depress the tabs on either side and then pull your head back sliding the harp out as you do to insert a new one place your harp in your mouth depress tabs and use your mouth to center the harp in between the plates when it is in position release tabs making sure not to get your lips caught between the harmonica and the plates as they pinch shut .bought bass case for strat wanted extra space .as the lining is q memory foam and holds the instrument gently in place it also acts as the lid for the open space .i keep several music note . books under the head stock .other reveiwer complained of the excess space but that s what i wanted . it did have chemical smell but as i open items in garage near trash can for the packaging .it aired in a few minutes . totally happy with service and product .
this product complies exactly what it promises biology is growing increasingly . the seachem products are excellent . recommend the use of this product .these are one of the most popular treats we ever purchased . i like that this product is american made . the pieces are lightweight cubes and odor free .these smell delicious and my dogs love them . the big tub is the most cost effective package of high quality treats that i ve found . those chicken jerky things from china are not high quality . 
good cable works for me using it in a rhythmtrak foot switch . just the right length . may order more as extra s .this mic stand will work great for mic ing full stacks and guitar amps .some people have mentioned the counterweight could be heavier but they need to pay attention to how they are orienting the feet in relation to the microphone . you should make sure one of the feet is pointing in the exact same direction as the microphone arm so that way the downward force is applied directly onto the support leg .fender a sx s jtxk feet performance series guitar cable ig good stereo cable for guitar or keybord .it s long enought . i recommend it
fits my low clearance mazda that comes with alloy wheels and inches of clearance between the inside of the tire and the suspension . have not tried it in the snow yet .used this to pull the rear axles in my jeep grand cherokee laredo x due to the dreaded rear axle oil seal leak . works great . would recommend .its a tire gauge that is pretty basic to use . you insert the metal pin into the tire tread gap and the rear part tells you the depth . walk around the vehicle and check all the tires . if the front tires are worn more than the rear its time to rotate the front tires to the rear .
it s very helpful to hold my lamp just above the tank . adjustable and just great . very stable and you can slide the platform right under the tank so it can t move .hard to mess up a floating square . it does contain the food .negatives . . . .to me at least the post that attaches it to the side is long . this puts it far from the corner .overall size float size is l x w . pretty large .inside float dimensions are approx . l x w .this ring could be reduced by a third or half . the foam material does support algae and is quite visible unless you keep the water level up to the black trim .i m used to a simple x clear plastic ring with trapped air floats . this type stays in the corner with the surface tension of the water .all in all i ll use it but wouldn t buy another due to the size .does the job nice size thermometer and stays where you put it in the tank does not break loose from the glass .
i m one of those individuals who writ s many patriot type letters especialy regarding the wrongful taxation of individuals . you can judge this keeps me very busy no it s something i d like to get away from but when government does not follow the law or acts without law in support well you know what i mean i just can t sit still . so i m always using envelopes . now some envelopes when you lick them are dry and gritty and the taste remins you of a horse s hoof . no i don t go around licking hoof . there s three things i want in an envelope i want it to look good i want it to seal properly and i want it to be of a heavy paper for security and class . this is the envelope i purchase and use . i give it a top rating because that s been my experience with it . when i print them out they don t smear and look good . i would not recommend this unless it delivered all that i expected and more . believe me you get your money s worth with this product .how do i review tape ? maybe i should have thought of that before requesting it but i needed packaging tape and i d never tried this before . what the hey right ? can t promise anyone this will be a good review but hopefully it ll be somewhat helpful . maybe just a tiny bit an eensy weensy bit okay maybe it won t be that either .so far it s very nice tape it sticks always a plus it doesn t shred like many others do it s thicker and overall it is superior to many i ve tried . i m not especially fond of the dispenser i ve come across better sturdier ones but it does the job . so would i recommend it ? sure i guess it d just depend on the price and if you have the need for super strength over regular packaging type .i couldn t be happier with this printer . i m a writer and a writer who doesn t particularly like reading off a computer screen . i can t see the flow and make easy notes or get an overall vibe of the thing while reading off a screen .plus i m also starting a phd program in the next month and so printing is a necessity .i don t need the absolute fastest and i don t need the absolute best quality . what i need is a solid laser printer that fits into my decidedly narrow budget .this fit perfectly and it works perfectly as well .i m very pleased .
i enjoy the wide rule soft feel to this paper . it is as you would expect from mead west products .these are well made sheet protectors they look frosted but this is the non glare . . . something i appreciate . . . it doesn t interfere with legibility at all . they are archival grade and feel sturdy . all in all an excellent product intended for heavy use documents etc .protects sheets well and is pretty durable and cheap . however mine were of a strange dull white yellow combo color which was kind of weird . for reference product made in china .
like most other reviewers here i found this finger toothbrush to be very hard to use .i would say i have average size hands for ex i wear a size medium adult male snowboarding glove .the finger toothbrush has a very large opening way too large for my fingers . and for my wife not a chance she could get it to stay on her finger .the bristles are too short and very close together . i don t think it really scrubs anything .i am going back to using a regular style toothbrush like the ones humans use . i have found that a toothbrush made for a baby works pretty well on dogs small dogs like mine .a good treat bag for the price . the draw string comes in very handy and it s made of good material . definitely get the larger size i got the cup size but it s hard to cram . cups of treats in there . also i have average size woman hands and it s hard to reach in to the bottom . it might be too small for someone with large hands .purchased for my pomeranian chihuahua mix . doesn t work very well on small dogs . i would highly recommend it for larger dogs though . it does it s intended job . it s just a really large brush and it s hard to brush my small dog with it .
we had our first years booster seat for years before the straps that hold the seat to the chair snapped from being pulled by my husband . he always pulled the straps so the chair could be as tight as could be although i could easily do it but just can t get it quite as tight . we used it through kids and just had another baby so we had to get a new one . i expect we ll have this chair for at least grandkidds too since this baby will be our last .this base is a must have if you are using an infant carrier in two cars . we have the latch system in both and it took us awhile to install the bases and have a secure fit . i couldn t imagine having to go through that everytime we wanted to switch cars . in fact now that they are in i won t remove them . i wish it was easier so we could go in our in laws s cars etc .i can honestly give this stars as last month i flew from ca to tn . and this held my daughter s infant seat graco snugride window shades side pockets and full bags of baby gear toys extra bottles that i had left at grandma s last time because i had no room for them . i could have easily put in a pack of diapers and been okay . it made it through the baggage claim without a scratch and i can see me using this for many more trips back home as we live far away from family .none of my things were damaged or dirty and i can feel better knowing my daughter s seat does not have the germs from the traveling . i had my daughter in her sling and since traveling alone was easily able to get my lb bag of luggage gone long time this seat and carry her . i did not hurt my back and got the seat out while waitng for our ride put her in her seat and took off the sling which i slipped in this bag all while alone !andin less than minutes . . .no kidding ! a lady next to me said how amazed she was i did so so easily and quickly .you will not be dissapointed . . . . .
connected two of these cables to charge my battery on my truck battery charger unit is in garage works perfect .the battery tender junior v charger comes complete with everything needed to charge your v battery . i purchased this model to specifically charge my motorcycle battery and i am pleased to say that the unit works great . it is a very compact charger and is supplied with several attachments to ensure that your battery is kept in an optimum condition .i made the permanent hard wire attachment to my battery using the color coded leads connected directly to the appropriate positive negative terminals on the battery . the opposite female end has an end cap which can cover the inlet when not in use . when i know that i will not be hitting the road for an extended period of time i simply plug the unit in to maintain my existing battery s power supply .battery tender makes larger charging units but this battery charger is great for charging everything from batteries for atv s and motorcycles to scooters and lawn mowers . because of it s very discreet size it does not take up any needed space . i would recommend this product to anyone who wants to protect their battery investment and do not want to compromise space and versatility .i see a lot of negative reviews for this charger that i think are partially due to amazon s incorrect description and the fact that most people don t know what size or type of charger they need . including myself i am a practicing electronic engineer with more than yrs experience . i did not know much about battery chargers until recently researching what a good battery charger should do . this charger only delivers a max of . a . this means if you try to charge a discharged auto battery ah it will take a long long time . this charger does work great for topping off a car battery at . v . the instructions included clearly state the charger will automatically shut off after hours of charging . the charger will restart and continue charging if you unplug and then plug the charger in again . best to get a higher capacity charger . this charger does have a float mode sort of . actually it shuts off the charging current and monitors battery voltage . when the battery voltage drops low enough the charger cycles on to top it off and then shuts off again .my summary st i like this charger and think it does a good job for the price . gold box special was . tax . i would definitely buy it at the regular price for it s basically automatic . don t have to set the voltage and it won t damage anything if you reverse the clips accidently . compact size and reasonable quality clamps .this charger does what it is designed for . that is charge small batteries and top off larger automotive batteries . this is an excellent maintenance charger for all batteries to keep them fully charged when not in use . my opinion personally i would not leave any charger connected to my battery for more than hours . now i use a cheap mechanical timer that is set to turn on for hour every hours . i would prefer a timer that i can set to turn on twice a week for a few hours .the charger is small feels solidly built with heavy plastic . it gets very warm aftercharging at . a but not warm enough to be concerned . no cooling fan i gave this charger stars because price and performance is very good . build quality is good as well .amazon description poor is incorrect in that this charger is not intended to be used to charge a low discharged car battery . the chart in the description that shows the charging times is different than the manual . . the included manual has a chart that states this charger should only be used as a top off or maintenance charger for auto batteries . in addition the charger in charging mode automatically shuts off after hours of charging . a good safety feature in my opinion . charging details i discharged a car truck jump start battery pack to . v or approx charge . typical full charge is . v to . v . to discharge the battery i used a battery alternator tester . i have a voltmeter attached to charger and a current meter in series with battery and battery charger negative terminal . at the start of the charge the charge current was . a and then jumped to . a in a few minutes . after hour the charge current is . a . charge voltage is . v . after hours the charge current is . a . charge voltage is . v . after hours the charge current is . a . charge voltage is . v . after hours the charge current is . a . charge voltage is . v .note that the charge current is decreasing as the battery is approaching full charge . this design feature will prevent overheating and extend the life of your battery . after hours the charge current is . a . charge voltage is . v . after . hours the charge current is . a . charge voltage is . v . after hours the charge current is . a . charge voltage is . v . after . hours the charge current is . a . charge voltage is . v . after . hours the charge current is . a . charge voltage is . v . after . hours the charge current is . a . charge voltage is . v . after . hours the charge is complete and the charge current has dropped to . a . battery voltage is . v and declining . charger is in the monitor mode . in monitor mode the charger ac power is w measured with a belkin watt meter .almost hours seems like a long time to charge a battery and this isn t even a full capacity car battery . but it did a good job of gently charging the battery especially when it was near full charge . the important thing to me is the charging current declined as the battery neared full charge . this prevents overcharging and truly tops off the battery to maximum capacity .i tested the battery the next day with a battery tester and it passed well within the good battery full charge limits . the results were much better than the charger that came with the battery pack where it tested near weak .very happy with the purchase . i would buy this exact model again . should there be any problem s in the future i will update this review .ships from and sold by amazon .
these strings aren t for everyone and probably not what you want for everyday normal playing . but if you re looking for a fast playing string with a bright sound this is the string . in addition to putting them on my guitar i also have a six string banjo guitar tuning and just couldn t get the sound i wanted from regular guitar strings . light guage nickel strings were recommended to me and they were exactly what i was looking for . they have a clear bright sound that great for picking and strumming . i play a lot of bluegrass and irish music and i feel these strings are ideal for that purpose . i use a lot of d addario strings on my various instruments and i think they offer the most bang for the buck in terms of quality and tone . you can pay more but i don t think you get that much more . although these were intended for electric guitar they also work well on resonator guitars .the d addario exl bt nickel wound electric guitar strings balanced tension regular light are great ! i ve been a long time fan of d addario strings and these strings did not disappoint .they were very easy to string my fender strat with and stayed in tune a good long time . the strings had a good feel to them as well .where i noticed the balanced tension the most was when i played chords . you know how you have tuned your guitar and it s tuned as well as it s going to be tuned but when you strum that first chord something just doesn t sound right ? you check the tuning and it s tuned alright but why isn t it sounding right ?these strings gave a clear clean sound when i strummed those chords . bar chords were terrific too . impressive .i think i have some new favorite strings for my strat !these elixir nanoweb acoustic guitar strings are amazing because they sound like new strings for a long time months unlike other guitar strings . great product . these extra light strings are not light enough for my playing enjoyment so instead i buy elixir nanoweb strings in singles so i can select the gauges that i like even better . a great product no matter what gauge string you choose .
these envelopes are first quality and seal easily . they are made of a bright white stock lined with a security pattern . if you need envelopes and dislike licking the flaps these are for you .the price was right for these business size . security self sealing envelopes . they are sturdy and protect the information you are mailing .these envelopes are the perfect size for those quarter fold cards . they look nice and the flap seals well . they are not too thin either .
this paper works very well for my photo printing needs . i ve used it with mycanon pixma mx wireless all in one photo printer and i m very happy with it . it s not quite as glossy as thecanon photo paper plus glossy ii . in x but it works quite well for what i need .one thing i really appreciate about this paper is that while one side is glossy the other is basically like card stock so you can write notes on the back of photos or you can fold your photos to use them as cards . this is good quality paper for a very good price . i m very happy with this style paper and bought it in this the . x and in the x sizes . as far as i m concerned this is all i think i ll ever need . it covers all of my home photo printing needs .i purchased this paper because it was the cheapest brand out there and printing your own photos is an expensive hobby . i had intended to use epson papers for trial runs or copies for friends . however the quality of my photos was incredible using epson paper . the colors are much more vivid and they don t fade over time as some photo papers do . i now use epson paper for all my x photos and i save money !i have always used hp photo paper on a hp printer but just recently i purchased a canon printer so decided to use canon photo paper . the results are stunning . the colors are very vibrant . i m happy to say that i will be purchasing more of the canon glossy photo paper . i also want to try the matte photo paper .
have used a california duster for over years on brand new and old car finishes from black to white . this duster keeps a relatively clean maintained car looking show room shiny and takes only minutes to use . how many things out there can give you a spiffy shine in a couple of minutes ?the key to using the duster is to follow the clear instructions provided . you must let it dry out a day or two before initial use . it has a waxy coating on the fibers all the more reason it does not scratch the finish and it has to dry out before initial use . have read a couple of reviews that claim the duster scratches but suspect it is because they didn t let it dry out . the one time i forgot to do that it looked liked it scratched scared the daylights out of me ! but it was just swirls on the surface from the moist wax easily removed . and if there is moisture on the car s surface it too will look like a swirl or scratch until it dries .second it is is a duster not a scrub brush . only to be used on finishes that are otherwise clean but have dust pollen on them . if you scrub with it to remove mud splotches bird droppings etc . it will scratch just as dry rubbing a car s finish with anything will scratch it . you let the duster do the work lifting the dust right off the car . doesn t just push it around but actually lifts it off .maker claims it only gets better with time and dirt but of course can t figure out how that could be true . but have never noticed any problem with use and dirt accumulation . tried washing once which maker says you can do but seems to remove the waxy coating and defeats the effectiveness . ya it may last forever but i buy a new one once a year hey it s pretty inexpensive .be the envy of neighbors get one of these and be as amazed as they will .works just as described . it does well by giving me a surface to loosen the dirt off my car cleaning brush and it also allows the dirt to filter through and go to the bottom of the bucket . very tough also a few times i have thrown the water out of the bucket after i m done only to see the guard launched across the driveway no harm to it and just rinsed it off for the next use .here in texas our cars don t get that dirty however this soap does a great job getting what dirt we do get off .
this pump works as advertised . i needed it to transfer fluid to the rear differential of my honda element . screwed it into the quart bottle of fluid and pumped differential full . . . . . .no muss no fuss !used to replace transmission fluid in acura integra automatic transmission perfect length funnel to preform this process . sits perfect above engine t pour fluid in . cap on hose is nice to prevent mess .i use only synthetic fluids for my toyota camry which i keep in mint condition since the day i bought it new in . mobil extended performance motor oil . royal purple max atf synthetic automatic transmission fluid royal purple fully synthetic power steering fluid and toyota anti freeze coolant .i won t give a lesson on why synthetic fluids are far superior to conventional fluids . i ve had that argument way before auto manufacturers started requiring synthetic fluids right from the factory . they are far superior .in the case of this brake fluid . i ve compared all the spec . sheets on all the major brake fluids and this one meets the highest standards . i just keep is simple with fluids and follow two rules . change every fluid on your vehicle yearly more often n the case of the motor oil depending how much you drive and use the best fluids available . this is the best brake fluid available .
these lighter strings are still the best thing for guitar tone since they ran a wire to them . my other review was for the heavier gauge cobalts but these sound just as good regardless of p strat single coil or humbucker . great tone sustain and flexibility . i am sold on any cobalt gauge head and shoulders better than any other string on the market and i have tried them all .these are the gold standard for all strat type electrics fender or not . i put these s on all of my strats regardless of the brand . they are durable enough to take a pounding and sound great . i tend to play my strats a bit rougher than my gibson s or acoustics so these are well tested in my house . i get a bit carried away with amp volume and tend to bend the strings a bit . i will continue using these on all of my strats until i find something better which i haven t yet . i do use other strings on other types of guitars and you can see my reviews on those as well .these are bullet proof . they take a pounding and last as long as you could expect ! ! !i use fender strings and i have used many other brands as well . i like nickel for the reduced fret wear and the sound . i change out my strings about monthly and if a particular guitar is being used quite a bit i can go to weeks for hard playing .i started using fender strings with the stratocaster bullet strings as they are specifically designed to fit into the tremolo bridge on the strat . they sounded great . i use these for my telecaster in factory spec and they are real nice too .i do not recommend using stainless steel strings on guitars because stainless strings are like using stainless steel files on your frets . i have seen some real damage in some cases in a relatively short time period . stick to nickel and you will be glad you did !
there are two pieces to the outlet cover back part replaces the outlet cover and needs to be screwed on and the front cover which is released from the back cover by squeezing the two plastic pieces on the sides . the plastic side pieces are part of the back part made of stiff plastic and extremely difficult to squeeze . this outlet cover also did not fit one of my outlets it would not stay flush to the wall .this is a perfect baby proofing tool . the strip cover will cover most standard sized power strips . there is a hole on the side for the power strip to plug into the outlet and a wide opening on top for it to connect to the devices plugged into it . it is really easy to put together just snap shut in places . it is also easy to adjust as there is a button on the side that allows you to slide it between different sizes . overall best power strip cover i ve seen .i bought this neutral color off white cover upc model a i don t know how that differs from model andmommy s helper power strip safety coverto compare the two . unlike that item this cover is expandable from to . in length . the roughly cylindrical compartment is about . wide and high . the slot where the cords for the equipment come out is wide and a maximum of long . when closed the hole for the power strip cord is by . holes are provided in the base for wall mounting but no accessories are provided .to open the thing you press two tabs on the inner lower cover then slide off the outer cover then lift the inner top cover . place the power strip into the inner lower cover then replace the inner top cover then slide the inner cover into the outer cover .the plastic is stiffer compared with the mommy s helper model but it also seems more brittle . i don t like the fact that there is no way to flick the power strip switch without half disassembling the thing . it can hold a wider and higher strip and transformers than the mommy s helper model by about in either direction which is nice . buy this from amazon .com !
five stars because it works on my digitech gnx guitar processor which requires volts and about milli amps . this has an output of milli amps . for electronics the voltage has to be correct . but an appliance will only draw as many amps current as it needs . so this adapter is coasting when used with the guitar processor and can be used with other devices that draw up to the mamps . just be sure your v device doesn t require more than the ma this can deliver . but it s a power adapter i cannot be in love with a power adapter .this is a great mixer if you are looking to do simple podcasting or solo music production at home . it s a great little unit . the only set back is that you can not use condenser mics with this without an external phantom power supply as there is no phantom power on this unit . you need to get the model if you need phantom power otherwise this will work fine with regular xlr or hi z microphones .very versatile power supply and much cheaper than others . this is not true isolated outputs but it is quiet and that is what counts . i have the fuel tank chameleon and i end up using this because it fits the needs of the pedals on my board the best mainly because of the ma output . here is a comparison of the jp chameleon and the onespot . i have all three .t rex fuel tank chameleon ma outputs v v maoutput v v maoutput v v ma use or only not bothoutput v ac majoyo sp ma outputs v maoutput dc v maximum output of maoutput dc v maoutput dc v mavisual sound onespot ma v only daisy chain power into pedals not exceeding ma
just like the nylabone dura chew wishbone chew toy my dog can chew on this toy for hours and is unable to destroy it plus it keeps her interest .purchased this kong goodie bone to specifically fill with marosnacks and cheese cubes ! old kong red goodie bone dog toy last yrs before replacement ! great product from kong that works with treats other than kong .kong extreme goodie bone dog toy medium blacki adopted a young adult dobe girl a month ago and she is a very aggressive shredder and chewer . stuffed toys are killed and eviscerated in minutes . she tore a large kong pet stix to pieces in less than five minutes and skinned her kong squeaker tennis balls and a kong air squeaker yellow stick she still plays with the stick sans the skin . she s played with her extreme goodie bone for two weeks and it has sustained no damage ! what more can i say ? future toys will have to be kong extreme .
it s very helpful to hold my lamp just above the tank . adjustable and just great . very stable and you can slide the platform right under the tank so it can t move .i boutght two of these for my two tortoises . they were easy to assemble . the lights hang from them nicely and i like that i can adjust the height . the bottom plate is not heavy enough to offer much counter balance so it must be placed under the tank . i found the price to be very good compared to industrial type light stand alternatives that i was pricing . the only reason why i gave it stars instead of is because of the screw mechanism . in order to assemble and when you want to adjust the height you screw unscrew the twist knobs . these knobs don t actually get screwed into any holes but just tighten against the inner rod . to me over time these could come loose and cause the hot lights heater to fall under my basking tortoises . of course this is a worse case scenerio but it could happen . i would have preferred pre determine holes that the knobs could screw into . of course not having these allows more freedom in regards to height changes . so it s all relative as to which you prefer .fit my gallon long wide high just right . the two glass pieces came already inserted into the plastic piece that allows the glass to be lifted for feeding . the other extra plastic piece goes onto the rear glass piece in case you have filters in the back and need to cut slots out for them . however i don t use that plastic piece and have a inch and a half space that fits well for my filter and heater . it also comes with an attachable handle that makes it easier to lift the glass .
this product fits like it should and would look really nice if it had been shipped properly ! i got it and the box was all crunched . the item had no cushioning around it and the front is bent in . need to return for a replacement ! it would have been stars if the front had not been bent in and it was packed properly ! fits right over my burner rv stove and rest on the counter top . i will be adding rubber feet so that it will scratch the sides of my stove nor my counter top ! to secure it you have to screw it to the counter top . the back has a hing with screw holes in it where you can secure it or it will stay put without screwing it down . it came with long screws . not sure if i want to secure mine yet . i have a new rv and not sure i want to put screw holes in the knife holder behind the stove !the picture is slightly misleading . this is only the mounting bracket it does not come with any wiring . but is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a wire flat cable . the bracket is flat on one side and curved on the other . the curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch . the connector on the end of my t connector fits well and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket . it sure beets having the connector flopping around !simple ! you must do accurate measurements so you don t damage walls or doors in tight and close spaces . put the vehicle in the parking spot line up the parking mats next to the tires mark the precise location of each mat in relation to the tires back out the vehicle slide the mats into former tire location done ! now roll the vehicle back into place . simple !
it s a well build daisy chain dc power cable . it has good lenght between two plugs . you won t have difficulties to plug your pedals .works great no issues . bought this to adapt the mike plug to jack so the mike can plug into a regular amp for the grandkids to karaoke with .as with all boss roland products the boss fs performs as designed . i purchased it to control both my boss me multi effects pedal and my fender blues jr amp . the a switch in non latching mode allows me to cycle through stored effects banks in my me and the b switch in latching mode allows me engage and disengage the fat overdrive switch on my blues jr amp . everything works exactly as planned . the fs rugged compact fits right into my into me carrying case and easy to use .i read a few reviews where people were complaining about batteries . . .something to complain about . as with most guitar players i don t use batteries in my effects pedals i use an volt ac dc adapter . visual sound offers the one spot ac dc adapter kit that has a volt battery snap connector adapter . i removed the battery cover then using a small rat tail file i carefully cut a notch in the battery cover for the snap connector to pass through . i then put rubber feet purchased at ace hardware on the bottom to allow the snap connector cable . . .battery problem solved .i also use the fs as a sustain pedal for my yamaha ypg portable grand piano and a control for my rc loop station simultaneously . the possibilities are limited only to your imagination . it is somewhat expensive but it is a great product ! ! if you need a duel switch then i highly recommend purchasing the fs .
works just like it needs to . perfect fit for the tailgate on my chevy when the oem clip busted .great fitworks great . fairly easy swap . just be aware the front window regulators are the same on whether you have a suburban or tahoe or one of their gm family members . not so for the rear regulators . the full size suvs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones . the vehicle input feature amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference . the pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at but the vehicle id feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit . beware ! ! ! ! just so you know the dorman and fit the full size and the and fit the tahoe size vehicles .
great price and is what i was expecting it to be and do . not sure how long it will last time will tell .not only do they not fit very thin and wonder how long they will last . also if you have batteries with the post and screw nut the latter is not covered .how can one really rate it as it is used for protection and no idae how long it should last yet is was as listed so i give it the benifit ogf the doubt . . .
i have an fj cruiser . it s not a quiet vehicle . i accept that .i have been working on upgrading my stereo system replaced the head unit put in x speakers in the doors etc . well the x s are much more responsive than the stock speakers were especially in the lower frequencies . so i developed a buzz . i bought the dynamat to see if i could get rid of that after i tightened everything that i could find .installation was easier than i feared thanks for the tennis ball tip btw ! as far as the real results though i m not sure that i ve noticed a real difference in sound quality noise or heat . perhaps some . the rattling has reduced but not eliminated .does the product work ? possibly . it s hard for me to say either way .i mounted these behind the front grill whereas the original single horn was in the engine compartment . it is an improvement on the sound level but not as much as i expected . i did use the provided relay and ran gauge wiring original was somewhere between gauge that did not rely on the original horn wiring .the horns are well made and i expect them to last the life of the vehicle . i only gave them stars though because the sound is not the ear splitting wake up and pay attention to what you are doing volume that i was expecting . so even though i will keep them i will probably be looking for something that is even louder .hi . . . . . . . . . . . . .this has been an interesting purchase for me . . . . . .first i should say that red line products are the highest quality you can put in your car . . . . .there are a few others out there . . . .iam using . . . .transmission power stering and brake fluid . . . . .for motor oil i use mobil or pennzoil ultra . . . . .iam sure red line oil is just as good . . . . . .when i changed all my fluids when i got my car i noticed improvements right away . . . .the steering felt better and the transmission was shifting better . . . . .my car gas millage is to . . . .i can do on the highway with cruise control on . . . .back to the water wetter . . . . .i have no idea if its working or not . . . .my temp gauge goes to the same place and i dont know what its doing in my radiator . . . . .nothing bad is happening but i bought it because of the price and the name on the label . . . .i had to spend . . . .red line rocks . . . . .if you read the technology i would say it makes sense but dont expect to see a result . . . . .i trust the name . . . .race tested products . . . . . . . .joey
i just recently got my first laser printerbrother printer hl dw wireless monochrome printer with which i am very happy i find it works exponentially faster and more efficiently than any ink printer i have owned and then these labels came up which i thought was the perfect test for my new printer !essentially they print up great and of course it will vary from printer to printer but i didn t have any issues with these smearing or getting caught or anything of the like . if you are looking for return address labels for a laser printer then these work extremely well and are priced at the same as just about any other pack of address labels they are worth it . god bless amythis is just the thing i was looking for ! i needed some paper to create labels for my business and these worked perfectly . they printed very nicely on my inkjet printer and did not smear . i also like the fact that they are removable if i need to adjust them on a package . i ll be adding these to my faves and buying more . after being frustrated with other paper and labels i was really happy to finally find a product that works !these seem to work the same as other shipping labels so i m not quite sure of the benefit of trueblock tm technology . it s a label right ? ! it works fine but only stars since i didn t really get what the new technology was supposed to do . i wouldn t pay a premium for it . also take note these are made for laser printers not inkjet printers . there is another version of this product made specifically for inkjet printers .
the string winder with a string cutter and pin puller is an excellent design . it will be very useful when installing new guitar strings with all of the items needed for the job .my only issue is the shipping charges for such a small item . the shipping cost were almost as high as the cost of the item itself making the purchase of this item an unfavorable purchase price for a single item . if you need an additional item on an order from this seller you need to check the shipping cost or you will not be getting the good price advertised for the item and may consider purchasing it elsewhere .does what it is designed to do it holds about picks . small piece of adhesive tape on the back . the supplier refunded some of the postage . amazon promised to credit my account credit never appeared for the highly inflated shipping costs . a item cost . for shipping ! be careful and read everything before you click to submit the order .i do some guitar repair work and one of my customers needed a lp case . i have bought a lot of stuff here on az so looked at this one and had it shipped to him . he says its great so that is my review .prices are always great on az and prime saves me money in shipping . stars is my tops anywhere .
we love this product so much we bought a second unit . our cat gained tons of weight while being free fed . now we can control when she eats have it supply a meal at a .m . so she s not howling at us to feed her in the morning and then we have the second feeder open at noon . we feed her wet food by hand at night . the problem i had with the other types of gravity units is that cup is the minimum allowable . we need to feed her less than cup in each of the two daily dry feedings and this unit allows you to put as little or as much kibble as needed . i have not had any of the problems the other reviewers stated cat being able to push the tray for another feeding tray not turning etc . the only complaint i have is that the instructions are not that clear and there are no additional trays to purchase while one is in the dishwasher . i bought the second unit so that i just have to fill the trays every four days instead of every two . to clarify the instructions just plug in the time of day when the feeder is to open . i thought originally that you had to program it for each of the five trays to open . so one unit has one time plugged in for am instead of five am s and the other has noon plugged in once . tray rotates whatever time s you set not just and hour periods . hope that helps .so far this is the best auto cat feeder for wet food i ve used and i ve used them all .pros large trays can hold a lot of food easy to clean food dish easy to program and can be set for specific clock times not just hours from now all controls are hidden when closed clever cat has not yet figured out how to get into it pretty heavy so not that easy for the cat to move or flipcons not specifically designed to keep wet food cold might be possible for cat to push the tray forwardmore detail on the cons technically there is an area under the dish that seems designed for an ice pack . however it is only under the food that is currently available so it wouldn t help to keep ice cold before it is served . not sure what the point is there . however i still use this for wet food up to hours ahead . i just freeze the wet food using oversized silicon ice cube trays stays cold long enough .another reviewer said that her cat was able to push the tray forward to reveal food . when i first got this i tried pushing it myself and was able to without a crazy amount of force . however i think it s more force than most cats can muster and my cat very smart and willing to spend hours destroying auto feeders has not been able to figure it out . she now just sits in front of it close to meal times and stares at it until it rotates .overall this is the best auto feeder for wet food that exists . i do wish the trays locked into place more firmly and that you could put ice packs under the entire tray but it is still a great product and reasonably priced .i fed this food during the hottest days of summer as it has a lot of moisture to it . i prefer to feed dry food but every other or every third day i have been feeding felidae . during the hottest weeks one can was all i needed for four cats . a fourth of a can filled them up at once though sometimes they came back a couple hours later and finished the portion . i feed under and to the side of the air conditioner to keep the food fresher during the hottest days .then they also have a pan of dry food in the bedroom and another in the kitchen .i feel very confident with felidae because of it being made in the united states .i have rinsed out the can and poured some of the water in with the food . big mistake they won t eat it . they won t eat it with anything mixed in it i .e . pieces of cooked chicken .straight from the can they seem to really like both flavors i have been buying .
i bought this for out little granddaughter rather than buying a high chair which would take up floor space . i taped a thick plastic sheet onto the fabric seat cushion of one of the kitchen chairs one that has arms and used the self straps to strap it securely to the chair . although she now can use a regular chair like a big girl but on her knees here she regards it as her special chair and will ask to sit in it to eat to color whatever . i am happy i bought this . we stopped using the attached trays fairly quickly though but they worked well when we used them . once she no longer needs it at the table it can also be used as a booster on movie theater seats .we got this seat since we have a small kitchen and have heard from other friends that their full sized high chair took up too much space . the tray is easy to remove and clean dishwasher safe too i can get ds in and out of the seat fairly quickly . i like how securely it fastens to our chair at the table .this booster folds up nicely and can easily be taken with you if you plan on going out to eat . the only downside with this is they tray can become loose with little hands . my lil guy somehow got his fingers btwn the white tray and the blue tray attachment and couldn t get his finger unstuck and started to cry . i couldn t figure out what was wrong until i looked down . i will be vigilant of that next time we use it but otherwise really great system .i have this seat in both this color and the older style in green blue plus we bought one for my parents house . we put my son in it as soon as he could sit up and it was great . . .if he makes a mess we just wipe down the seat no washing a cloth high chair cover and the tray can go in the dishwasher !
this makes it so easy to charge in conjunction with my battery tender . so far it has fit all my vehicles batteries acura integra toyota tundra toyota pickup bought this to install with an aftermarket kenwood navigation on my toyota tacoma . it took several hours to install but it works great with the wheel controls in my toyota .this fit all four o sensors on my toyota tundra and i could have not completed the job without this specialized socket .
how can one really rate it as it is used for protection and no idae how long it should last yet is was as listed so i give it the benifit ogf the doubt . . .this is a good fit for my motorcycle pc . the stitching seems to be coming loose but there are some decent winds out here so i am taking it with a grain of salt . time will tell how long it lasts and if it doesn t hold up i will update this .rated the best value filter on the market by independent testers that tested each filter on the market by using them and then cutting the filters open to see how they held up under actual use . they then rated the filters on how well they fared and also how well they were made .
we brought it for the space between kitchen and dinning room . we didn t want to drill any holes therefore we choose this . it clearly said can be hardware or pressure mounted . yes they are correct if you are not planning on using the door function to this gate . if you plan on opening the door part it will release pressure of the side of the gate . therefore you need to remount the gate . i m not feet but only a petite person and it will be hard if i just climb across .bottom line it s misleading when they said it can be pressure mounted ! please note if you are using the door it will release the pressure mount side .i was really excited about this gate until we tried installing it . my husband and i are both pretty handy so we thought it wouldn t be a problem .the template for mounting was a nice addition especially if you ve tried mounting a regalo gate to the wall those things are impossible to align perfectly and quickly .here s what you need to know before purchasing if you intend to mount at the top of stairs the opening must be between . and . wide the hardware must be screwed into wood or studs not drywall or anything else . you may need a stud finder to locate the studs . the hardware has to be at least inches from the stairs . make sure your walls extend a ways beyond the steps . you need a drill with a bit you need a phillips screwdriver this won t work with short baseboards or curved baseboards that are shorter than inches if you have baseboards that aren t completely flat e .g . if you have trim at the bottom then you will have to do some creative problem solving either filling up gaps with wood or removing trim .if you have tall flat baseboards then you can use the handy dandy extenders they include for you on the top of the hinge .i d give this stars for pressure mounting for top of stairs use but about for the unexpected complications . i reviewed the information before purchasing but i wish i had known above before making my purchase .we purchased this gate for the top of the stairs . we live in a townhouse and have an unusal stairwell i suppose . installing this gate was a great pain ! we could not find a stud in the wall to match up with the areas we would need to install it at and had to purchase toggle bolts to better secure the gate into the wall . . . .so a toddler putting lots of force on it would not rip the gate and the drywall out thus tumbling down the stairs . also we have molding and while the gate does come with extenders to work around over the molding it didnt work for us . we had to install the gate above the molding thus leaving a to inch gap from the floor to the gate . this is bad ! our daughter has tried to squeeze her way under the gate to get down the stiars and almost managed to do this feet first . luckily i am never out of view of her upstairs nor not upstairs with her small townhouse ! and only purchased it for the safety of knowing she wont lose her balance at the top of the stairs . i have only used this gate for a top of stair gate so i have nothing else to compare it to . hopefully it is only that i live in an oddly shaped home and it works great for most other folks .note it does take a lot of measuring up and making sure that every point matches up perfectly or the gate will not operate properly or smoothly . i do however like the top lift bar to open the gate and it is easy to unlock and lock back into place with two button ontop the lift bar handle . while i still had problems using it as a top of stair gate i do think it would work very well as a doorway gate .
don t bother with any other testing methods or strips . get this kit and learn how to use it . then you can buy refill bottles when you need to . i wouldn t trust anything else .i use this when i do any water changes . my fish haven t died so i am assuming it s doing what it is supposed to do . works a lot better then other products .won t leave any water cloudy .i do water change and have not lost any fish .i trust this to be the only product i use .
the user guide for this calculator is obviously either written for another model or by a tech writer who has serious problems . in many instances when keystroke examples are provided if you key in the information as indicated the calculator will simply give up and provide an error message .the machine works fine if you just address it intuitively after you have trashed the guide book .i recommend the canon mp provided you can get along with usb and no networking . the product is otherwise well featured and has performs according to specs .if you are faxing using a voip line and getting errors using the default settings set your transmit and receive data rates lower . i use because its reliable albeit slow .i find the user interface for any non simple tasks to be below average and counter intuitive . i agree with other posters that sections of the manual are incomplete . the internet needs the ability for users to directly comment and enhance manuals .wish there was a model with wireless networking .this is a fine consumer home office laserjet pinter . affordable quiet compact including a power cord with no quot wall wart quot . easy installation . only two drawbacks they are minor but hp and other manufacturers need to pay attention to this one of the shoddiest quick start set up posters i ve seen . a monochrome rebus on cheap paper . if you are not an experienced user of personal computers or printers you may not understand what you re supposed to do . no users manual . there is a page pdf file but hp and others please ship a manual with the product . please !if you can get past that . . .then stars 
just got this in this week . looks nice and works as intended . for bucks can t really go wrong . i use this with a behringer c and have had no trouble getting it to fit . it s a bit snug but i would prefer a snug fit over a loose fit .put these on my prs se and i love em . i can restring in a matter of a minute or maybe . they were a perfect fit . no problems whatsoever .this arrived a week sooner then expected ! i am very happy with this bag my fender lh san miguel acoustic guitar fits perfectly ! it is nicely padded and has lots of pockets for anything you might need to carry .
a regular mm socket will not fit in the space of my equinox . this is a kind of shorter mm socket designed only for oil filter cap job . it works fine .this is designed to work with the valterra bayonet fitting on your gray or black water dump valve and it does just that . . .works as needed only problem is it will only fit a standard oil jug not the gallon .
these will keep your child warm but are not approved for use with most car seats . you should not put anything between the baby and the seat . these are so padded that your child could be ejected from their car seat in a collision caused by materials compressing same reasoning why children should never have a puffy winter coat on their child when they are strapped into the car seat . there is a way to modify this item cutting out the back piece to make it safely usable in car seats .i registered and received this gift for my baby shower . i put it on the car seat and was looking forward to bringing my baby home in it . fortunately my hospital has a car seat safety inspection station and they told me to take the bundle me off immediately . they say because the bundle me goes under the baby it interferes with the safety restraints . the straps that go around the baby may appear to be tight but the bundle me may actually bunched up under the straps and therefore the restraints aren t as tight as they should be . then god forbid there was an accident the force could cause the bundle me to shift loosening the restraints and baby could come lose . kinda defeats the purpose of a car seat if you ask me . when there are so many safe covers the ones that are elastic and go over the car seat but not under the baby for example the eddie bauer carrier cover which is what we ended up with why take the chance ? i d rather error on the side of safety .i couldn t tell you if this is the reason my son s head is round in the back smile . but i can certainly say that this is excellent for keeping the baby s head in a straight and comfortable position specially when they are newborns and they spend a lot of time in their carrier bouncy chairs or swings . this is not intended for use while sleeping in their crib .i would not recommend using this product in lieu of the standard car seat headrest while transporting the baby in a car . after market headrests that have not been crashed tested could cause serious injury in the event of a collision .
i purchased this neat voltage meter that s really what it is a couple of years ago to keep track of the rv s battery voltage . i checked it against a fluke multi meter i use at work . they were within th of a volt of each other . stars for accuracy . i tapped into a vdc circuit and installed a volt outlet in my cougar travel trailer so that i could monitor the voltage at all times . this meter has been plugged in there for two years now and is working flawlessly . highly recommend this unit if you want to keep track of the battery voltage and the voltage the rv s power converter is putting out .update three years now in almost constant use . working just fine .i currently own volt models of this charger and have had no issues after numerous years of use . recently bought a honda ct which is a volt system . the only way to keep the battery at full charge over extended periods is a good reliable trickle charger . i had to go with the best so a new battery tender junior was the ticket .got this unit in dec and plugged it into the batteries on two motorcycles . after two days the green lite came on and has been on since . the batteries seem to be charged correctly .
this is a great value . i contacted the company for measurements inside the case to see if it would fit an ibanez rg series . it fits perfectly . thank youthese a cheaply made with corrugated plastic however they are surprisingly durable . these are not . x paper size . they are about half sheet size .this cover does not fit a full size acoustic electric hohner guitar . i measured the whole at but this cover does not even come close to fitting ! it measures in diameter so check your guitar closely !
i think these labels are a very good all purpose label not just for an inkjet printer as you can use these by hand too .not only to label file folders or to label cd cases but i would also use these for just about anything i want to label like when i buy something in bulk and freeze it . i always like to label what the item is as well as when i froze it .these labels look white but when you peel them off they are clear . you can use either a pen or marker on them .the label size is ample so you can write what you need to on it . i have some labels just like this but they are white . i think i prefer these clear labels .i did find them alittle hard to see where one label ends and another one begins . i like that they come in a pack of . i doubt i will have to buy anymore of this size label in my lifetime .iam very happy with these labels .i really like the size of these . i hate wasting a bigger label like an avery for return addresses and have even cut them in half sometimes . these are nice because they are smaller . i would have liked them slightly shorter but a touch wider . mostly because i usually have lines and it just fits . i don t want to use pt fonts either . my text also bled off the top edge on the bottom rows of the sheet a few times . i know my printer isn t perfect everytime it draws a page through so i realize it isn t completely the product s fault . i use a laser printer i don t think it matters much that they say inkjet . . .maybe using a laser product in an inkjet might smear but i never had a problem the other way around . i suppose i can fool around with the margining setup for the label template to alleviate the text drift . i do like the easy peel and not having to pick at the corners of labels to get them off . i have always liked the quality of avery labels and these did not disappoint me . i would get these again .i got these labels with a specific purpose in mind . i am making hot sauce and beer for christmas presents this year and i needed to make custom sized labels for the bottles . these work perfectly for my needs .color b w laser inkjet . . . it doesn t matter ! these labels hold the ink very well . they aren t glossy so don t expect a perfect outcome if you try printing high resolution photos on them . the adhesive is sticky enough to make sure the label stays on but you could still peel these labels off a glass bottle without tearing it . i m not sure if that s a good thing or a bad thing it just depends on your needs .i also wish the pack contained more than just sheets because it starts getting pretty expensive if you need to buy or packs .overall avery makes another winning label product !
notice in the name guitar input . this is not to be confused with the amplitube irig which achieves input and output through the ipad ios devices headphone jack . headphone connections can be noisy and have reliable connection problems . they also depend on the built in ad da converters in the ipad ios device . this apogee jam k is a professional quality input device that has dedicated a d analogue to digital converter but depends on the built in hardware of the ipad ios device for playback . on the other hand apogee one has both ad and da convertors for both input and output .amplitube irig from ik multimedia has a simple stereo headphone in and out jack plug that plugs into your ipad . the built in hardware in the ipad is something that i love for doing something like watching a movie cozying up to the inch screen but for audio phile quality you need a dedicated a dedicated pre and ad convertor and that is what this apogee jam k has . mind you it has that for audio recording input but playback is handled via your headphone jack on your ipad . you can of course just use that for monitoring your mix and then save the file in a digital format internally and send to a playback device with pristine digital audio quality e .g . saving as a .wav file . this makes the apogee k jam a very usable device to achieve high quality recordings at a very nice price .so here it the continuum . amplitube irig for headphone jack input and output quality built into your ipad etc . the apogee jam k for digital quality conversion on input only with playback being handled by headphone jack on ipad . the apogee one on the other hand at roughly times the price gives you both ad da conversions so it has its own audio output jack plus tracks of recording either instrument and or a balanced external microphone jack . it also comes with a built in condenser mic that is pretty amazing . it also has volt phantom power for using your favorite condenser mic . when you get into the apogee duet and quartet you get more connections plus the all too important option of midi connectivity .this device is a converter that works with rca inputs and outputs . the input seems to be geared for the db range for consumer level audio range . this box also has the ability to monitor the input directly with headphones .i bought this as an interface between my mixer instruments and mics to my macbook for garageband . you have to go in and change the input and output in osx but it works great !
best way to use this or any hob filter is to find a filter cover for your water in take . fluval makes one that fits on most . then you can add more bio into the compartment thus negating the need for this filter . it s their cash cow .http www .amazon .com fluval a edge pre filter sponge dp b ll ry ref sr ?ie utf qid sr keywords fluval filter coverthis is a classic power filter that has been around for a long time . many competing brands of power filters have come and gone over the many years that this filter has been in production . and this one continues to sell today . this design has a lot going for it . it is inexpensive to purchase reliable easy to set up easy to clean and the replacement media are affordable .this filter is what is known as a hob hangs on the back of the aquarium power filter . the hang on the back power filter design usually cater to the casual aquarist . that is not to say that advanced aquarists do not use them . it is just that there are other filter designs that do a better job of mechanical chemical and biological filtration than the simple power filter . the main advantage to the power filter is the ease of set up . there are no hoses to cut and holes do not need to be drilled into the fish tank . a small motor driven impeller pulls water from the tank passes it through the filter media and then releases the water back into the tank . all this is done by sending the water over the top edge of the tank .i can recommend this aquaclear to someone with a freshwater tank of less than gallon capacity . it runs reliably and quietly . if you hear a lot of noise coming from the filter please remove the energizer motor and check the impeller . also make sure that the inlet tube is fully inserted on top of the impeller well . the mechanical filter is basically a coarse sponge . you can rinse this sponge out to remove excess debris and put it back in the filter . just be sure to rinse it out using dechlorinated water or waste water from the tank itself . unless this sponge becomes hopelessly clogged with debris possible if you have live plants you will not need to replace it . the ceramic rings that are included were designed to provide a place for beneficial bacteria to colonize and attach to . the carbon pack will need to be replaced . how often will depend on your tank s particular situation .a canister filter will usually provide superior mechanical and chemical filtration capabilities in comparison . however depending on the design maintenance will usually consume more of your time . wet dry filtration provides superior bio filtration but will usually be more expensive . the penguin marineland power filter brand with their bio wheel is said to be better at biological filtration than this and most other competing power filter design . it is priced competitively with the aquaclear . however with the penguin you will have to regularly buy their filter media . the aquaclear gives you more flexibility and more room in the filter box . i have used an emperor in the past on a large cichlid tank . the emperor which is similar in design to the penguins was made by marineland . very good design but again you will have to purchase their filter media on a regular basis . with the aquaclear you can buy your own filter bag buy carbon in bulk and save money over the life of the filter .why stars instead of ? the design allows for a lot of water by pass . power filters allow for some by pass to compensate for clogged filter pads . the aquaclears seem to allow more by pass than its competitors . also because of the coarse design of the mechanical filter sponge a lot of the smaller particles pass through . the prepackaged carbon bag fits snugly in the filter box of this filter perhaps packing the carbon granules tighter than they need to be . the water simply just flows around the bag and only makes contact with the carbon on the edges of the bag . i have also found that the carbon media is not very good at removing tannins from mopani wood from the water .this is a very inexpensive filter to maintain . i know a fellow hobbyist who does not use carbon . he just rinses the sponge during his water changes puts it back in and turns the filter back on . his only expense with this filter was the initial purchase price . i use carbon so there is a little bit of regular expense for me . but there are those who choose not to use carbon . some cichlid keepers blame carbon as a possible cause of hole in the head disease . i am not an expert and clearly the issues of carbon s relationship to this disease is beyond my qualifications to discuss . since i no longer keep cichlids i have continued to use carbon .the filter max iii pre filter was a great buy . i use it as a pre filter on my aqueon hob filter . the filter max helps keep the filter clean and allows me to extent the period of time between filter rinses and cartridge changes . this in turn really lets the biological filtration establish itself both in the filter and on the sponge .i like the filter max so much that i have purchased another for my penguin . . .the only challenge with that will be matching the round pre filter to the rectangular intake on the hob filter . . .but i will figure it out !

i really like these tab dividers . i think it s really great to be able to buy multiple sets in single purchase . this listing comes with sets of tab dividers . each set has tabs . i buy some many of these for my kids for school so i like this option of being able to purchase in bulk .these tabs are a bit different in the sense that your titles for each tab isn t actually on each tab . it s printed off on a standard sheet of paper that is inserted into an included protective sleeve that goes into the back of your binder . the tabs are transparent so you are just reading the titles through the actual tab . it s different but nice . it s really easy to create and print these out . you can simply go to the wilson jones website and input your info there to print out or you can follow the easy to follow directions included with this set to do this in microsoft word or wordperfect . not only can you print out the title page for your tabs but you can also print out a table of contents that goes in the front of your binder behind the included protective cover .these dividers work great in any size binder . the title pager holder has a section that unfolds when you are using binders greater than . this makes the titles extend further so you can read them at all times regardless of the binder size . this is a really helpful feature .i find this to be a very durable set that you should be able to use over and over . especially since you can reprint the tab titles or table of contents at any given time .the tabs are described as square but they are still rounded at the edge as you can see in the pictures . i like the size and shape .i really like this pack of tab dividers and i would highly recommend them .this is one of those products where there is just not much to say . the dividers fit in a standard binder their quality is just as good as any other dividers they come with the little paper rectangles they re cheap they can detect gold and spirits and they separate your papers so as to avoid inbreeding . all in all they are as you would expect .if you re looking for a basic accordion expandable file this may fit . it contains letter size pockets labeled a z some of the letters are doubled tripled up or you can organize by any method you choose by writing or better attaching a label see about readability in next paragraph at the top of the pocket . being accordion style each individual pocket can expand to about an inch and the whole thing easily expands to inches . a long and somewhat flimsy flap wraps over the top and secures at the front via a long strip of velcro that accommodates all degrees of expansion .i m using this file to organize my product warranties and it s adequate . but it s so dark the black letters printed on the dark blue folder are very hard to read and very little light gets down into the folders to illuminate the papers within . i recommend it only if a lighter color is available . actually for the price i recommend browsing office suppliers because there are other options with better aesthetics . and if you re interested in beautiful i recommend looking for products by galison or punch studio .
accurate little accessory only works with guitars . it seems to me that this tuner works by sensing vibrations of things that it is in contact with . only buy this if you intend to use it with a guitar . i don t know how effective this would be with other stringed instruments or for uses other than tuning .works as advertised for polishing my guitars . i don t use any other cleaners such as fender polish when i use this cloth .i have several stands and this is the second one of these i bought . it works fine and will hold any size acoustic guitar .
i love this gadget . i bought two extra bases for my infant car seat for both my husband s and my mother s car . unlike my car there center seat has a harness strap . those are hard to get really tight . my center seat has just the lap belt and it was easy to secure the base . with the harness strap it was just too hard to get the seat in tight enough . with the mighty tight it was a snap . you just hooked it in cranked it and voula ! ! !that seat isn t going anywhere . i love it . it is easy to use it makes the seat secure and it is sturdy . you must have this if you are trying to secure a seat in a position with a shoulder harness .i really hated to spend the money for a travel system ! it just did not make good sense to me . i was not sure exactly what type of stroller i wanted and decided to wait until after i had baby and then decide ! besides there were irrestible sales on infant car seats too sweet to pass up ! i purchased my infant car seat and got the one i wanted . then found this little contraption ! love it !i was able to keep this in the back of my mini van . it folds flatter than a full stroller and is very light ! there is one latch on the side that keeps it locked together and this is an easy release . it is out of the car open and ready for baby in the car seat .it has a strap that you can thread through the underside of the car seat for protection . it is kind of a pain but once you get the strap adjusted to your seat it is not that bad and definately worth the extra effort in terms of safety .the basket is huge and accommodated my extra super jumbo backpack diaper bag . it will serve you very well for trips to the mall when you have many shopping bags .the wheels turn easily and swivel . you can take this anywhere !the brake mechanism is easy and effective .if you already own an infant car seat in blue this will give you the look of a travel system ! . . .without the price !when luca outgrew his infant car seat i was able to purchase the perfect strollers for him !this is the perfect solution if you do not want to be committed to an entire system and are looking for the flexibility of being able to choose a different stroller down the road .this seat liner is a must for leather seats ! i use it in my jeep grand cherokee and am so glad that a friend told me to buy it ! easy install and really does protect those expensive leather seats ! !
this thing is awsome . it has all a camper or over the road traveler needs for emergency power and presurized air . comes with battery cables air pressure hose and coinnections instruction booklet a must read and several types of power outlets . you will need an electrical extension cord which is not included to charge it up via ac outlet or you can charge it up via the volt auto lighter adapter cord which is included but which i would not recomend unless you have no other source of power because this thing looks like it packs a punch . i like it and think it s worth the money . i just started using it so icannot speak to its durability bt otherwise it is awsome . recomend .it keeps my batteries topped off and i don t have to watch it like a trickle charger so that s a real plus . i drive very little so the vehicles sit for weeks between trips . my chevy k doesn t have much in electronics though it does have a slow power drain that i could never find so a battery disconnect switch was the best answer . my ford expedition is another story so this tender is what it needed . the battery weakens in sub zero weather so that it does not always start the vehicle and i thought buying a new battery was the way to go . last time i did so it was a few years ago both vehicles take the same size battery and it cost about bucks but it s now bucks ouch ! if that s all i needed i would give it stars and be done . however what is supplied with it was not adequate for my needs and likely so for many others so it gets stars because i had to modify all three cords to make it workable on my two vehicles .i think the best way to use something like this is to have the ability to easily detach it so you can drive off like with a block or dipstick heater that have cords that reach the grill so you can just unplug the extension cord . if your vehicles are parked outside near an outlet like mine this option isn t available with what s provided with this unit . the ring terminal and the alligator clamp cords are about long so if your battery is in the back of the compartment the plug will not reach to the grill . i don t like routing it out over the fender and under the hood because you can cut the wire off . the cord from the unit is only long so that won t make it from the outlet inside the garage to the vehicles you have to keep this unit out of the weather and the extension cord for it is about bucks . even if it does reach from outlet to battery the connectors are still under the hood so you still have to raise the hood to disconnect it . it also does not come with a cigarette lighter adapter as with some other models . i used some leftover wire i had to make my own extension by cutting the cord and splicing in some wire to get the plugs to the grill and that seems to be working fine . i also purchased a cigarette adapter from china for under a buck with free shipping and added some flat plugs to make my own adapter . without making my own accessories or a purchase of about bucks i would have to place the unit under the hood and route an extension cord to it and then have to pop the hood to remove it . it seems adding some longer wires to these connectors would not have been all that difficult and well worth paying a few bucks more to get it . there s not much in a vehicle that s away from you or a . when you add the cable from the unit when you re parked outside . also the more cable you add to this the unit the greater the voltage drop and the longer it has to operate to top off the battery . if the cable lengths aren t an issue for you or you don t mind spending more money for the extras then it s likely a star unit . i doubt you would need to do anything to make it workable on anything other than a car or truck .this replaces my previous one of these that just failed after years of good service keeping my summer only vehicles batteries charged over winter storage . you will likely need to get one or more accessories such as the volt extension cords so you can reach all your vehicles cigarette lighter plug in instead of standard battery clips that come with the unit etc . highly recommended . also have the two bank unit that was causing am radio interference on the house circuit returned it under warranty and they repaired it on a timely basis . i am able to get very long battery life using battery tender products .
this stuff is fantastic . i have dogs and they occasionally have accidents and then sometimes there are just mysterious spots in places . i found a stain on my carpet recently that appeared to be oily charcoal powder no idea where it came from or what it was and this stuff combined with a steam mop did the trick . for most messes i don t need the steam mop just spray this on wait and daub up .note that this bottle does not come with a sprayer . i use these as refills .i have a puppy that still occasionally has accidents in the house and so i like to keep some urine cleaner on hand . when we ran out of simple solution i went to my local pet store for an immediate replacement . when i couldn t find my tried and true spray i decided to try nature s miracle . i have used this spray a couple times now and have not been thrilled with it for a few reasons . it stinks ! it smells like ammonia and i m not sure which is worse the spray or my dog s urine . if it completely got the odors off my floors the smell would be more acceptable . . . which brings me to my second point . i can still smell something stinky on my tile floor after using nature s miracle a total of three times completely drenching the area and perimeter . i am honestly not sure if it is the residual smell of urine or the spray or both . therefore i m not convinced of the product s efficacy . i think i might have had a similar or better result with just regular vinegar or ammonia which i already have at home .i ll continue using this bottle until it runs out then i ll go back to simple solution smells great and works wonderfully ! .i love the fragrance of this . however i do not spray it directly on her . i spray it in my hand and then rub it on her . if i didn t to this it would be way too strong . with this said it s a very good spray to keep any dog smelling good . i love it ! ! oh . . . .and a plus is that it will last for a very long time .
fit my nissan frontier s oil pan perfectly . looks to be of nice quality . torque to ft lbs on the frontier anyway works great . fairly easy swap . just be aware the front window regulators are the same on whether you have a suburban or tahoe or one of their gm family members . not so for the rear regulators . the full size suvs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones . the vehicle input feature amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference . the pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at but the vehicle id feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit . beware ! ! ! ! just so you know the dorman and fit the full size and the and fit the tahoe size vehicles .works just like it needs to . perfect fit for the tailgate on my chevy when the oem clip busted .
wow my dogs love this brought of them and very please was please with shipment and will order again and would recommend this dog toy for any dogs .it is an excellent dog food . my chihuahua loves it . the pieces are very small and easier for a small breed dog to eat . no regrets purchasing it here . it was highly recommended to me by breeders i know .this is one of my dogs favorite treats . she is a very picky eater and loves these for a reward . the freeze dried liver was recommended by a trainer . it s a very healthy treat compared to most .
ordered one of these gig bags for a new les paul the hard shell cases are back ordered and i didn t want the guitar just sitting attracting dings and dust .fits a lp studio perfectly has room for small items in an outer zippered pocket . does the job !nice bag with great features . it is slightly large for a telecaster or stratocaster but works fine for either .i actually swapped another bag putting a les paul jr in this one and a tele in the gibson bag as thegibson bag was a really tight fit for the lp jr . headstock .it is so small and cute and totally fits my guitar with and without the bag . so if it is outside the bag of course i can showcase my guitar . the guitar inside the bag fits perfectly too . it stands as it should and it was a snap literally to set up it was like three steps or something . wow . i am very impressed considering the price ! ! ! !
nice heavy duty security envelope that has a self sealing edge and does exactly what it is advertised to do .this is an item that does what it says it does . comes in good shape and works well . what more can i say ?this is a shade of blue black a nice combination color . it is made to fit perfectly a genuine lamy refill replacement .
i purchased this step stool along with the munchkin folding stepstool . i thought this one would be good because of the adjustable height . the stool arrives set at the lowest setting and to make it higher you rotate the top degrees . an intersting design ! however be warned . . . the top is somewhat rounded and if your child steps near the edges the stool will topple and they may fall . this is worse on the higher height .in comparing the two types of stools the munchkin folding step stool seems much studier has not tipped yet . though i am dissapointed in the height of that one .if you are purchasing this simply as a bath seat then it might serve your purpose well . . but as a step stool there are better options out there . . . that you can also sit on by the bath !hope this helps !my daughter is in the th percentile for height and this stool is just the right size for her to get on the potty . i imagine if your child is not as tall this stool may be too short . the issue we have is that it slides very easily on our laminate and tile bathroom floors . if she is running into the bathroom and gets on the stool too fast odds are she ll end up on the floor . we just bought rubber grippy strips to line the bottom of the stool with . hopefully this will help resolve the problem .this is a good step stool . it helps my cautious year old get into her queen size bed no frame .
could be better . it is hard to exactly push the cap down directly onto the nipple and keep the nipple at degrees . the tightness of the fit with the base of the screwtop nipple lock causes it to skew to one side leaning the nipple . . .meaning that anytime you turn the bottle with the cap on and the liquid hits the nipple opening you are prone to have a leak . i ve had these caps fill with similac when the bottle topples over in a diaper bag . . .try feeding a hungry baby in a mall with a cup full of milk that is about to leak all over everything . . .not fun . . .to improve the product there should be an upside down saucer shaped plastic piece in the dead center of the inside of the top of the cap . this would guide the nipple to a perfect position every time eliminating the problem above .also this cap gives you no real grip on the top of the bottle . avent bottles seem to almost weld themselves shut after a few hours in the fridge . try opening an avent bottle with this cap on . about half the time the condensation on the bottle requires me to take the cap off to get leverage on the avent screw on nipple locking ring . but maybe it s just me . . .i don t know .on the plus side they are very easy to clean very easy to stack and float nicely in a sink full of water .these are just bottle caps . . .what do we expect ?i just don t like this product . basically it is boiling the water and the bottom of the bottle gets really hot and if you use the vent air bottle the water drips out of the bottom is it is really hot . i just started using the mircrowave and it seem to heat faster this way . it takes forever for the formula to get warm by this product .the cup comes with a rubber valve which is the spill proof mechanism . when the valve is on the cup there s no way to suck the water out which defeats the purpose of drinking anything from it . if you take the valve out then the cup is not spill proof . my baby just turns it over and the water comes gushing out . this things is useless . we ended up buying another cup at walmart that works wonderfully totally spill proof no matter what my baby does and easy to suck as well i just don t know the brand of it becuase it s not on the cup itself .
i have of these hanging on my wall with different types of guitars banjos and mandolins .they attach to the wall with screws . hardware is included to attach those screws to drywall . it takes about a inch hole in the drywall where a large screw shaped plastic piece is inserted into the drywall and then the regular screws go into the plastic .the piece that touches the guitar has some sort of silicone rubber which protects the instrument . the holder can be bent in or out a bit to better fit the instrument that you have .i have moved a couple of times and these can be removed and attached again .very sturdy well made product .idiot proof compact extremely sturdy . all metal enclosure with good quality jacks simple to understand led readouts . runs on aa batteries .features that set this apart from the slightly cheaperpyle pro pct are test tone function which sends a known volume signal down the line . very helpful in level adjustments down long chains of equipment . intermittent issue indication this is what made me choose this model . if there s even the shortest dropout the leds indicate it . intermittent issues are the most annoying and can be difficult to troubleshoot .my only complaints the a small screw holding the battery cover on stripped immediately when initially inserting batteries . it was like carving a bar of soap with a knife . quite frustrating . used my dremel to change it from phillips into a slotted screw and managed to get it out . there s an included belt clip that attaches with two screws on the back . this clip blocks access to the battery compartment which is ridiculous . luckily i have no need for the clip . i used one of the screws intended for the clip as a replacement to the stripped battery cover screw . no rubber feet on the bottom metal enclosure battery cover screw sliding around and marring whatever it sits on . i stuck some re purposed rubber feet on the bottom .after the few problem solving situations mentioned above this thing is a star product . too bad they couldn t go the extra step to make it star out of the box .now all i have to do is install these on my burswood strat copy . i know i m gonna have to drill holes for the locating pins i may even have to drill the tuner holes also . look forward to getting those crappy loose un smooth original hardware tuners off this thing .july just installed these fender locking tuners on my strat . didn t have to drill the tuner holes they were the perfect size . placed all the tuners in the headstock lined them up with a straight edge and just pressed each tuner very firmly into their hole with the locking part screwed in tight so as not to damage them and very lightly and carefully tapped them with a small rubber mallet to mark my drill points . then with a small magnifying glass and using a punch i made a center punch mark just using pressure by hand with the punch since wood is soft on each indent that the tuner made . set my drill depth with a piece of tape on the drill and was done in less than minutes .
works like the picture shows . hangers adjust to required width of head stock . wood finish is nice look on the wall .not crazy about having to pay shipping that amounted to half the purchase price for the stand not to mention having to wait five days for it to arrive . no assembly instructions were included in the packaging . i ve never owned something like this before so that was annoying . luckily some nice pictures were posted on the web page and i was able to figure it out from there . once i got it put together and placed my beloved guitar in the thing i got happier . it looks nice and holds the guitar safely padding protects the guitar finish . i d recommend this stand to others but be aware of shipping tax and consider the possibility it will arrive with no assembly instructions . not that you have to be a rocket scientist to put it together still . . .both of the stands had parts that had fallen out or were missing all together . when the pamphlet that comes with them states that they are fully assembled and guaranteed to be free of defects this is a major concern . it may be that i got a bad box that got missed by quality control but it does make me suspicious of pyle products .
does what it does and has what it said .works good so far .buy it when you can have compatible staplerspros . takes normal batteries . . bright well focused laser . . uses radio frequency communication not ir so you do not need line of sight to the computer . it will go through a wood podium . . works great with apple keynote and microsoft powerpoint . . works great with mac os x windows and linux . . no need to screw around with bluetooth .cons nonebought this for my wife s red laptop . it matches the computer and it works fine as a mousepad . nuff said !
nicely made comb . i like the clip ring on the end and made of stainless steel will make this product last .container is made in a pretty heavy duty plastic the hinge where the lid connects to the container is pretty weak but aside from that the rest is pretty well made . the lid has a strip of rubber foam along the outside edge where it comes into contact with the lid of the container which provides an airtight seal .generally speaking pretty easy to use and is as described .it s smaller than i thought it d be but quality is fine . the edges of the plastic are smooth and it does not have any icky plastic smell .
we purchased this gate for the top of the stairs . we live in a townhouse and have an unusal stairwell i suppose . installing this gate was a great pain ! we could not find a stud in the wall to match up with the areas we would need to install it at and had to purchase toggle bolts to better secure the gate into the wall . . . .so a toddler putting lots of force on it would not rip the gate and the drywall out thus tumbling down the stairs . also we have molding and while the gate does come with extenders to work around over the molding it didnt work for us . we had to install the gate above the molding thus leaving a to inch gap from the floor to the gate . this is bad ! our daughter has tried to squeeze her way under the gate to get down the stiars and almost managed to do this feet first . luckily i am never out of view of her upstairs nor not upstairs with her small townhouse ! and only purchased it for the safety of knowing she wont lose her balance at the top of the stairs . i have only used this gate for a top of stair gate so i have nothing else to compare it to . hopefully it is only that i live in an oddly shaped home and it works great for most other folks .note it does take a lot of measuring up and making sure that every point matches up perfectly or the gate will not operate properly or smoothly . i do however like the top lift bar to open the gate and it is easy to unlock and lock back into place with two button ontop the lift bar handle . while i still had problems using it as a top of stair gate i do think it would work very well as a doorway gate .we brought it for the space between kitchen and dinning room . we didn t want to drill any holes therefore we choose this . it clearly said can be hardware or pressure mounted . yes they are correct if you are not planning on using the door function to this gate . if you plan on opening the door part it will release pressure of the side of the gate . therefore you need to remount the gate . i m not feet but only a petite person and it will be hard if i just climb across .bottom line it s misleading when they said it can be pressure mounted ! please note if you are using the door it will release the pressure mount side .i generally like the look function of metal gates better than plastic ones . however when it came time to select one to install in our living room at the top of our stairs i didn t want one that had a metal trip bar along the bottom of the opening as most metal gates have which enable them to be pressure mounted . i selected this one because it had good reviews no bar across the bottom of the opening that can be a tripping hazard and we were familiar with the style as there is one at our son s day care that is very similar .we installed this gate at the top of our railing with a hardware mounted install and a newel mounting kit and so far are happy with it . one advantage of this gate i have recently discovered is it can be left open with the door swung to the side and out of the way enabling free easy access to the opening at the top of the stairs for those times when we don t need the opening secured . though not as flawlessly easy to use as a metal gate the open close mechanism is not very difficult to operate and seems very secure . you do need to put a small amount of effort into pushing in the button to pop up the handle when opening the gate and making sure the feet line up correctly when closing it . our month old has gone up to the gate and pulled himself up on it several times and it has shown no signs of being dangerous or unstable . the plastic paneling is very susceptible to fingerprints . we have only had the gate for a little over a week and i already see a number of them . i am sure the panel could be easily cleaned .overall i am very happy with this gate and would recommend it to anyone worried about the trip hazard of a metal gate at the top of stairs . i also highly recommend a newel mounting kit for anyone with non square newels which allows this or any other hardware mounted gate to be easily installed .
the keyboard bench is lower than i anticipated . the seat is very soft and comfortable . however it doesn t appear to hold anyone with excess weight .the width is nice wide enough to distribute the weight but not too wide . attaching it is a snap . the suede gives it a nice grip to your shoulder so the guitar doesn t slide around .this thing is really comfortable holds the weight of my les paul nicely . its slightly wider than most other straps which helps distribute weight better i can play for hours and my shoulders feel fine ! i feed the narrow end through of the strap holes and it sits flat and looks good . well made feels very strong . texture is very nice doesnt slip . overall a very good product .
these dividers are super thick and durable yet still flexible bendable . i was pleasantly surprised by them !there are dividers per set along with a clear cover and a clear paper protector sheet . the tabs alternate between colors though the dividers are still transparent .these are great sturdy dividers !face it you are reading a review on tab dividers . i wish i could make this a fantastic piece of literature but that isn t going to happen . these tabs are exactly what they say they are . they are paper dividers with tabs and they work well for what they are . that being said i really feel like they could have upped the thickness of the dividers themselves to they held up a little better . i don t foresee these lasting a long time in a binder you reference regularly because of how thin the material is . for an occasional use these are definitely good .you get what you pay for . . these mailers are nothing to brag about . the material is cheap and thin . i m not sure if these are even kraft branded ones . they look like the off market kinds . these are great size for cables or really small items . they provide adequate protection . you can t fit a cd dvd or book inside these mailers because they are just too small .
i had a medela single electric pump and therefore only had one shield . my sister let me borrow her double electric pump in style so i needed another shield . this works perfectly . i already had the tubing that i needed with the pump in style . i m glad i didn t have to buy a whole replacement set to use the borrowed pump .this valve did not work on my medela breast pump i have the dual pump . i didn t return it because i was going to have to buy as much for the shipping as i did for the pump . don t buy here . just go to a brick and mortar store like target to purchase . it s not amazon s fault . . . it s the supplier s issue .i needed some extra membranes for my pump . these did the trick . although i m glad i don t have the pump that was listed on the package . i would ve been mad if i got them in the mail and than they didn t fit ! i have the pump in style advanced and they fit fine . i think its the freestyle that it says they don t work with .
these envelopes are just right for greeting cards . i use card stock to make my own greeting cards and these are just the right size .a great price on card stock paper . really put it to the test . it holds ink well and the weight of the paper is just right for greeting cards etc .this works very nicely for printing my own cards . i use a scoring blade on my paper cutter to make a nice fold and the card looks beautiful . envelopes are available separately for the half fold and quarter fold size cards . when bought like that it saves big bucks over the inkjet card and envelope packs and i get the same results . if you make lots of cards this is the way to do it .
this seems to be one of the better levelers . there are two different scales on these levels . one is for the side to side back of the coach and the other is for the front to back side of the coach . the reason there are different scales are they are more or less calibrated in inches .for example it is simple trigonometry to determine how many inches the coach is out of level simply by using the formula for right angles and solve for one side . the input values are the angle determined by the level and distance from the level to the point at where you want to know how many inches of lift are needed .for the side to side level the markings are pretty accurate as long as you put the scale in the center of the coach as most coaches are within an inch or two of width from another . however for the front to back level even though you put the scale in the center the result will vary wildly due to the length of the coach . using this level on a ft coach will result in a far different measurement than say a ft coach .also if you don t put the level in the center in the side or back then the two ends of the coach will be different . for example if the level is in the center then when the level measures off level that means on either front or back . but if you put the level off center then the level reading might truly be on one end and on the other . again it is simply a principle of right angles in trigonometry .also do not rely on the self adhesive backing as over time it can move . as hard as it may be for you to do drilling a couple holes and inserting screws into the levels is the best bet .i have two cars both of which require the large sheet metal self tapping screws to mount the plate to the nylon retainers behind the plate the ones mounted on the car that the screws screw into . problem is that diameter of the plastic ring that holds the screw covers is too small to take the screw s large diameter head . the maximum screw head diameter that will fit the ring is . inch millimeters . option replace the nylon retainers on the car but different cars have different retainers so one must search for new ones that will accept a screw . option try to find self tapping screws with smaller heads . i shopped around for screws with smaller heads to no avail . option grind down the screw head s diameter . option not good on one car i used sheet metal screws that have a smaller diameter but do fit the rings and wrapped the threads with tape . this sort of works but i really can t tighten them down satisfactorily . so i have to check their security now and then . i m leaving the other car as is for now . maybe someone has more practical ideas ? sure would like to hear of them . btw see the update below .update i think i ve found a viable solution to the above problem . i used a sheet metal self tapping screw placed a inch long piece of ordinary shrink tubing i .d . over the threads towards the pointed end of the screw . used a heat gun or you can use a match bic lighter or soldering iron to shrink the tubing which effectively increases the thread diameter to about that of a screw . this allows me to tighten the screw securely and will last much longer than ordinary tape . one more thing the thickness of the screw head doesn t quite allow the chrome cap to fully snap into place over the nylon ring . the top of the head needs to be filed down a little leaving enough philips x to use the screwdriver .this is everything you need in a tread depth gauge and nothing you don t . here s how you use it you press the probe down into the tread gap to measure the depth . you then rotate the cylinder around to match the exact mark to the line . the measurements are on four sides of the cylinder making them easier to read than being stacked on top of one another . being able to rotate the cylinder makes it much easier to measure something as minute as of an inch .
i love the simplicity and reliability of this unit . it comes with alligator clips and o ring clips to hardwire to something like my atv . i hardwired the connector to the quad so all i need to do it connect and disconnect the quick connect clips .i have this securing a smittybilt receiver hitch with d ring and i ve been very happy with it . nice snug fit . no rattles . hav enot yet had a chance to test it s tensile strength in real world recovery applications but i don t think it s going to be the weak point . two keys included .if monster cable could only see the copper inside this jacket . normally when you cut a piece of heavy cable in the center and strip back the insulation you see nice shiny copper . granted the ends may be oxidized a bit but they are open to the air i cut this at the halfway point to make shorter cable sets or equal cable pieces . this cable while being nice and flexible looked like an old penny inside heavily oxidized and ugly as sin . i suspect its reclaimed copper times over without proper slag removal . that s the only reason i took away one star .also the crimp lugs supplied leave a tad to be desired but they include some properly sized red and black heatshrink . you are supposed to put the stripped cable into the lugs then fold each half over the other with electricians pliers my professional crimper was able to fold them but not close them tight on the wire so out came the persuader a oz claw hammer and some cement . yep that closed the crimp nice and snug on the wire . now it has a good snug grip . i did buy some professional lugs at the hardware store made of copper like a shiny penny and my professional crimper did those justice so their lugs are a tad sub par but you can put them on with just about anything . alternately i could have hit it with a propane torch and fed some solder to it which i may still do if there is excessive loss in the cable . i prefer soldered connections wherever possible .i also bought some nice bolt on attachments at the hardware store for pr that have a bar which snugs down with ea bolts and nuts on the back side . now that was a solid connection i drove the bolts home with my dewalt impact driver and a socket which grabbed the wire and would not let go then gave me a big ring to tie to that did not look like someone pounded a crimp lug with a hammer on cement to make it grab !i realize copper is expensive these days but this stuff was recycled or times over . new copper wire shouldn t look like a s penny under the couch . it sure makes monster cable s oxygen free copper look bright and shiny by comparison . on the other hand i did especially like the fact that the insulation is color coded properly red and black . i have seen high current wiring kits where the wire s insulation is entirely black entirely white or some other way of not coding the positive and negative by insulation color . even the space shuttle wiring is entirely white no matter what purpose it serves . the only identification each white wire gets is a black wrapper with a or digit number that is referenced in the schematics . nasa s wire is also silver plated copper and thus carries the same current of cruddy copper wire size larger with the same loss and less weight at x the price .other than the cruddy copper it s a good value you re getting feet of cable with precrimped lugs on one end and trimmable to length on the other end with a set of lugs you can pound onto the wire . it certainly has the heft of feet of too this shipped at over lbs most of which was the pieces of cable . it ran my inverter just fine so no harm .you also get a green ground wire to tie your inverter chassis to whatever ground you have be it in a car or a ground rod in the earth . like me you probably don t think you need a ground for a battery powered device when wwas the last time you grounded your remote control ? in theory ground wires should cary no current nor any voltage but the spinning fan on the inverter can cause static electricity . you do need to equalize any static charge buildup or leakage in capacitors or alternately stray magnetic fields causing voltage in metalic parts . sure these are small voltages between . and . v but they can flip a logic state if not returned to ground and also making troubleshooting a nuisance . while not absolutely necessary if you don t ground it be sure that somewhere from the output path of the inverter to your load you have a gfci plug . that way if the current finds another path back to the battery or to the inverter chassis it will cut off power in a fraction of a second preventing electrocution yours not to mention damage to the equipment .keep in mind that wire can carry s of amps approaching amps and will do a nice job arc welding . once you get this installed treat it with a great deal of respect . don t be shocked no pun intended when you make the final connection if there is a small arc emphasis on small the reason is that there are capacitors in the inverters that help to smooth out the current flow and they charge instantly when power is applied . when finished disconnect from the battery . use some extra caution when using tools like crecent wrenches around deep cycle batteries don t bridge to the other terminal . i had an electrician drop a crescent wrench inside a pac bell phone central office onto the vdc buss bars that powered the building s phone switch . it didn t even blow the fuse just vaporized the wrench into sputter . we crawled down to the buss bars and there was nothing even resembling a wrench where it made contact with the vdc bars . this product box even has a warning that if you are not familiar with high current wiring have someone who is do it .
this pencil is all metal . the tip retracts when you engage the clip . there is a twist function on the bottom of the pencil to twist to ensure you remember what type of lead you have in the pencil . the heaviest pencil of the mm pencils i purchased . eraser is the standard tiny pentel size . made in japanof all my pencil sharpeners this bostich pencil sharpener is my current favorite for many reasons it sharpens quickly and quietly for an electric pencil sharpener . the pencils come out extremely sharp sharper than from any of my other pencil sharpeners . although the motor doesn t stop running when the pencil is sharp it also doesn t continue to eat the pencil . i don t have problems with it breaking the pencil lead . it s attractive and has good weight so it doesn t slide all over the table when i m sharpening .there are only a few minor problems it sometimes sharpens the pencil unevenly so that one side of the pencil still has wood and the other is fully exposed . if i put the pencil back in and tilt it a tiny bit that does take care of the problem . when i take the shaving tray out there are some shavings that didn t make it into the tray laying inside the sharpener . it s a little messy .overall this would be a good pencil sharpener for someone who needs something quiet quick and stylish .if like most people you use pencils only occasionally get an old standby boston hand crank sharpener . frequent pencil users though should consider a good electric sharpener . this x acto by boston is a heavy duty device that should provide many years of service . it only handles the standard pencil size which is far and away the most common . the catch tray for shavings incorporates the guide hole for the pencil and snaps rather tightly onto the main unit . the tray doesn t hold all that much . the x acto is fairly comparable to my old favorite the panasonic auto stop a sharpener that i ve used for decades . there s no real auto stop function on the x acto but the motor slows right down when the pencil is sharpened . also while my panasonic has four suction cups on its base for attachment to a desktop the x acto merely has rubber feet . however it s heavy enough to make suction cups unnecessary . it should be mentioned that the x acto s manual warns against sharpening waxy leaded pencils so colored pencil artists might choose another sharpener . this unit is somewhat expensive but does one job and does it well . pencils sharpened in this device will have a good point but not a needle like point that will break off with little pressure . the x acto s sturdy and heavy duty construction makes it an electric sharpener to definitely consider purchasing if you need one .
after first receiving the wrong item not a mike at all amazon promptly corrected the error and sent the microphone ordered .this microphone feels well built from all metal construction and the xlr connector mates firmly with most cables . the included cable is light duty but not bad if you treat it with respect . for under twenty dollars pyle pro can t be beat . just be mindful it s inexpensive because it s made in china but it doesn t feel cheap in any way .the mike exhibits rich vocal tone throughout the midrange and upper registers while the low end is slightly attenuated . for most singers it will be just what they need . the cardiod pattern reduces feedback and background noise making it a nice announcers mike for corporate video production .one issue i have with this mike is when using it on a tascam d portable recorder with an xlr to xlr cable the tascam generates a digital pulsing noise into the input electronics . both of my pyle pro mikes have the same problem but both mikes work perfectly with any other device . the tascam d is known for this noise issue but it usually only occurs using an unbalanced non xlr input . in this case the unbalanced cable that comes with the mike actually works better with the tascam than the xlr to xlr cable .works perfectly for both my martin dreadnought and my fender stratocaster . solid unit good material and construction though it is made in china apparently but hey thats why its such a bargain !these are exactly what the doctored ordered . i have one setup to mic my guitar amp and another setup to mic my voice for doing guitar video exchanges . they are excellent quality for the money .
i had looked around for strap locks for my dean dime razorback and was not happy to see that most locking mechanisms were designed with a button on top to release them . my guitar straps attach on the rear and underside of the guitar which would be easy to accidentally press when the guitar hits my waist causing unknown horrible damage .then i saw these and knew they were perfect for my situation . i installed them last night and could not be happier . they are very solid and the lock is positive so you can feel the click when it is set . i am sure they will work well if your guitar straps mount in the traditional spots as well . this is a great product at a good price .note if you are installing on a dean razorback or ml the stock front strap mount screw goes through the plate body into the neck . . . .do not use this to mount or pull the old strap mount off and return the screw . . .it is too long and will likely split your neck . just drill a hole right next to it and install the locking mount right next to it it can touch it even and still function properly . enjoy ! i really am happy that my guitar is much more secure now and don t worry that i will hurt my favorite guitar .here s what strap locks are supposed to do securely attach your strap to your guitar . these do that much better than schallers and the fender rip offs of schaller .i used the schallers many years ago . they look great but the problem is they screw onto the strap with a nut . i am very good with maintenance check for loose parts etc . but at one gig with my super heavy american deluxe string jazz bass the nut worked its way off the strap and i dropped it . it was with a heavy leather strap and i did tighten it down with pliers upon installation and i m sure i kept it maintained . absolutely ridiculous and inexcusable . never again . unless you want to inspect and retighten your strap locks at every single rehearsal and gig forget about schallers . they re a good company and they make great tuners i don t fault the materials it s simply that threaded things can work their way loose a fatal design flaw for this type of device . come on its only purpose is to not allow something to come off of something else .the dunlop strap locks fit on with a locking ring . it is impossible to remove these from the strap by accident . if you re having trouble getting the lockrings on i have a youtube video posted to my channel nickweissmusic just search for dunlop strap lock installation . it s kind of tough at first but with experience it s very easy . the package instructions are correct but not very helpful .i have these on more than instruments and have never had even close to a failure in well over a decade . the package recommends periodically lubricating the mechanism inside the lock but i have never done so in my experience lubricants usually gunk things up more than they help for things like this . i ve never had so much as a grind or squeak from the button or ball bearings in these strap locks if i did i d probably just replace it . i do give the locks a little tug when i put them on to make sure they re engaged other than that you can forget about them which is the way it should be .the only possible downside is that these strap locks keep the strap a little further from the instrument then using no strap locks or the schallers do to which i say who cares . well i guess a lot of people care about that since i see it in a lot of reviews . if using no strap lock or a poorly designed one is worth it to you just so you can have your strap a quarter inch closer to your guitar so be it . i have seen ernie ball strap locks that seem to be a little lower profile i think they use lock rings too . maybe try those but i m sticking with the flawless track record of the dunlops .i love this wall hanging mount . of course you should use longer screws than what they give you and you should make sure to mount it in a stud or use drywall backing screws etc but that s just common sense .the actual product works perfectly and exactly as described . the arms are adjustable stay where you put them . this fits my string fender jazz bass as well as my acoustic guitar violin and even holds the neck without touching the pegs if you want it to . i will be buying more of these for my other stringed instruments .this is a very well designed product that works just like you want it to .
one of these is more than sufficient for small venues as a main keyboard amp with channels for a mic and backing track . a pair of these connected via the stereo link jacks will handle larger venues including outside gigs . they can be configured as a master slave set up with a single link cable a inch speaker cable or with two cables two fully functioning amps that can handle ten inputs assuming five inputs per cm . in reality the single cable configuration is more than sufficient .the low mid and high range frequencies are perfect for either a piano or organ . i have run both aroland rd nx digital pianoandroland v combo vr . the grand piano setting on the rd nx sounds like the real thing out of this amp as does the b emulation from the v combo .i did a direct comparison with this against amackie srm . inch compact active pa systemand the sound of this beat it hand s down . bear in mind that this was designed for keyboards so the sound has been optimized for instruments in their frequency range .vocals through the channel with the xlr are adequate but not particularly spectacular . also there is no phantom power or ground lift features so you will not be able to use this in a studio with condenser mics or correct electrical imbalances . that leads me to conclude that this is best for live performances .i use mine as a powered main but it is designed to function as a monitor with the main controls on the front of the box . that is somewhat inconvenient when using it as a main because the controls will be facing away from you . however once the levels are set during sound check you can control the levels via your instrument s volume and eq controls .there are a few things to note regarding mounting this on a mic stand . first the manual recommends that the total height from the top of the cm to the floor not exceed inches . i agree . this may be relatively small but it s heavy at over twelve pounds and the center of gravity at the limited of the recommended height is fairly high . it s easy to tip over especially of you are not using a tripod style mic stand with the legs fully extended .i got this for dollars when it was on sale . i don t like inch speakers for gigging but it has unbelievably good sound when going from the line out into a pa . the inch speaker is okay for practice and it has a jack for an external cabinet . be careful with the load you put on your amp though .the listing for this item can be confusing if you are not sure what stereo xlr is . stereo xlr is meant to be similar to your stereo headphones where left and right are separate unbalanced wires . this cable is configured to be a stereo unbalanced xlr to a stereo unbalanced trs cable . this item is not a mono balanced xlr to a stereo unbalanced mic cable .a little bit a soldering can fix this connector by moving the red wire from ping to pin with the white wire . pin then ties to pin with the ground wire .
fabulous unit compact quiet powerful and not too heavy . i cut off the alligator clamps and wired it to a way trailer connector so that i can plug it in to the rear of my truck . v is only present when the truck is running so this is a foolproof setup . i like the duty cycle although i do not expect that to be an issue .the viair p heavy duty portable compressor works great is small and quiet . i am still lookign for the right adapter so i can plug into v plug and the one i purchased with this did not work .my son suggested i get the whole k n system but i opted for the factory style replacement filter instead . o .k . i am cheap . . .lol . i installed this in my f . litre fx . i keep the avg .mpg readout on in my dash . i average . and i don t drive it hard . after the filter i average . . i was shocked and i am very pleased with these results .
this review is for the second version of this calculator the slightly larger grey black and white model with a rounded mound housing the keypad . i had actually ordered the older model the light grey model with the blue and white keys slightly smaller which i had had previously but sadly lost . i had considered returning this newer model but finally decided against it as it is now listed as being discontinued by the manufacturer so if i returned the newer one i did get i very well might have gotten the same model back . . . . . . . . . .i was at first extremely disappointed in the newer model . why both the newer model and the older model which look completely different have the very same model number is completely beyond me . i mean people who work at texas instruments are supposed to be very intelligent and know what they are doing . . . .but why they decided to give to truly different calculators the same model number is something i don t think i ll ever understand . i mean . . .what kind of genuis makes this very simple mistake ? one who wants to fool online and catalogue buyers who have to trust that the packers will pack the right model perhaps that said this newer model though larger and more than slightly bulkier than the older one does have a few advantages . . . .i think .i don t remember the older model having a tax or tax or rate key nor do i remember it having a battery backup as the newer model does .this newer model has a nice little compartment for the battery which need only be opened with a single screw . so the entire back of the calculator need not be taken off with the slight dangers therein of getting dust into the machine or disturbing the delicate circuitry in the half a minute or so that it takes to change the battery . with a neat little separate oompartment for the battery changing the rest of the back of the machine need not be disturbed at all !this is all the more important as more and more calculators sadly are made with no user replaceable batteries enclosed no one is instructed in these other still newer calculators to take them to the nearest authorized repair shop of the designated manufacturer and have them replaced there like wrist watch batteries ! first wrist watches now calculators ! talk about planned obsolence ! buy even this newer model sv and keep it close ! although the newer model sv has a wrap around windshield numberical display instead of what is to me the far more esthetically pleasing and clearer picture frame numberical display found in the older model sv the numbers still are well spaced and clear to view . it also has the nice l a r g e numberic display which is not only on this newer model sv but also on the older model sv . . . . .and also on the belated dearly loved and sadly lost original texas instrument model no sv which i once had and enjoyed more than both of the sv models put together ! it was small handy and a beautiful medium bone yellow in colour . it also seemed to stay on forever pr at least an hour or so if i remember correctly . oh that texas instruments would bring that model back sigh ! well this new m del sv though not the older handier model sv nor the original model still has many good points most of which are delineated above . it is also a desk top model which can be carried in a pocket book if necessary and also in a briefcase but not in a wallet . it is bigger than the two previous models in the texas instrument line . . .but does have that priceless customer replacable battery chamber . although i do prefer the previous two models this newer one now available is not a bad little calculator all things considered .but i would still welcome greatly ! the return of the original model and or the original sv .there comes a time when one must face reality and deal with the fact that the ti plus is today s standards and once you hit pre calculus using any other brand and some may be just as good is an inconvenience and will cause the student to spend unnecessary time translating ti plus activities to . . . casio or whatever . just bought two of these for my kids once upgrading from an aging ti the other from a not so bad but different casio .there are several reasons you ll want the ti plus if you are taking or approaching calculus in high school or college everybody speaks ti plus in our case it s true for the kids hs teachers and the saxon calculus courseware it is a significant improvement over the previous ti series models being more . . . graphical for example there are now little boxes where you can enter then lower and upper limits by navigating there it s generally compatible with the previous ti models whatever you learned to do on a ti or a ti you generally do it in the same way on the ti plus . it s now available at significant discounts as either used or refurbished saved a lot ordering as good as new refurbished unitswe are happy with the ti plus . i am because we don t need to spend a lot of time translating the ti illustrated examples we find in our calculus courseware and focus on the math instead . the kids are happy because the interface is a lot more intuitive than the ti .there was at least one reviewer who had indicated the price of this lubricant was reasonable . i am not sure he calculated its cost which is roughly . per gallon . at that price it may be cheaper to never lubricate your shredder and just replace it when it wears out . i am not advocating that you should not lubricate your shredder but just plain motor oil will be nearly as good and a lot cheaper considering that you can lubricate many items in your home by using an inexpensive oil can filled with inexpensive motor oil . some may want to use a light grade in one can and a heavier grade in another but you can save yourself a lot of money over the years by not buying special purpose lubricants when they are not really needed . of course you would want to use higher priced synthetic oils like mobil one in your ferarri or mercedes that is required for their warranty but even that standard for high performance engines is still more than times cheaper than this shredder oil . decisions on the use of certain types of oil are not going to make or break you i am just suggesting putting such small decisions into perspective . its similar to the example of the guy who buys a new car every two years and trades his old one in but he will change his engine oil every miles because that s what his father told him to do . the only reason for changing the oil so often is if you are selling your car to your father who will keep it for years .in conclusion if it makes you feel better using the special . per gallon shredder oil i think you should do so . but you may want to acknowledge that at least some of your decision is based upon how you feel as opposed to how you think .
this is the answer to your all your power supply needs . if you own more than pedal and we all do you need this . it powers my wah and all my stomp boxes with plug . it comes with all the different power plug options and a daisy chain for pedals . it has the adapters to power pedals without a place to plug in by attaching the battery snap to the battery place on the pedal then pluging into the daisychain . it also has the pin plugs to attach to the daisychain for pedals that require that kind of plug in . and it has a foot lead wire so you can reach out to your pedals or pedalboard without having to drag a heavy extension cord across the stage to trip on while your playing . you ll save enough money to pay for it in no time not having to buy batteries . get it you ll love it ! ido not let the size fool you . this is a very handy piece of equipment and it s so easy to set up and use . just plug a inch stereo cable into your sub out on your mixer and then into the ha then plug in up to pairs of headphones and your set to track overdubs . this is perfect for a small home studio on a budget and it s built like a tank . be forewarned that this a very basic headphone distribution system you can only adjust volume from the ha and it would be wise to purchase a real long stereo cable and extensions for the headphones if you want to isolate vocals .the listing for this item can be confusing if you are not sure what stereo xlr is . stereo xlr is meant to be similar to your stereo headphones where left and right are separate unbalanced wires . this cable is configured to be a stereo unbalanced xlr to a stereo unbalanced trs cable . this item is not a mono balanced xlr to a stereo unbalanced mic cable .a little bit a soldering can fix this connector by moving the red wire from ping to pin with the white wire . pin then ties to pin with the ground wire .
i gave it only stars because i found the suction not so good with this pump unless i got it just right . . .i have large breasts f cup so i think that might be the problem . when i get it right . . .i can get as much as i get with my pis . . .but i don t like that it s only one side at a time .i don t agree with the dimensions listed on amazon s description . it does come with pieces that are about inches long . . .which will cover one side of your crib . however i don t know what the . x part is . i measured the ones i have and the inside of the plastic measures about of an inch . . .and the outside of it is around an inch . the plastic is fairly flexible . i have the aspen in crib and it fits my rails just fine . my month olds have not pulled them off . . . .yet there is another listing for this same product http www .amazon .com prince lionheart crib rail teether dp b jbalrq ref pd sbs ba you might be able to get an idea of the size shape of the crib rail it expects .i covered just one side of their crib at first but this seems to work and i just went out to a local store and bought another pair to cover the other side of the crib .i recommend this product however you need to measure or consider your crib rails they need to be on the skinny side .update after several months of use i noticed that the varnish from my cribs has come off of the crib and stuck to the inside of the teething rails . it is the very very top of the crib rail and not the entire crib rail . i hardly noticed until i looked at it harder . i still like what the product does however i m disappointed that it has ruined the wood . my cribs are cheap anyway but still i take good care of my stuff . i don t know if someone put some furniture polish on the crib rail to make it do that i didn t . i thought this was important and wanted to make sure you know about .i really should ve read the reviews on this but i didn t see how i could go wrong . it s described very well and the pictures really sell it . i think i may have gotten one of the defective ones because the arms that i got did not look like the arms in the instruction booklet . there was not sufficient space and they were too close together in length . once i put it together there was no way to fit it onto my table without possibly breaking it or the table . it stuck at a ridiculouly high angle and would not go any further . i hope i have better luck with the next brand i try because i hate the tall rolling highchair that we got as a present . for now i am content with the bumbo . amazon is going to take it back as defective and refund me the shipping .
clear cover on the outside inside slips on inside of cover . rings snap open and closed with ease ! perfect for one subject or topic !this binder is of great quality . the d rings are especially impressive opening easily with a lever at the bottom and closing very securely due to a small pin on one side that fits into a depression on the other . this keeps paper from slipping through the crack between the rings with the binder is very full . many binders i have tried to use clear photo storage sheets with will catch on the rings where they divide when turning . not with this binder .two pockets on inside front and back clear insert areas on front and back cover and along spine .if you are tired of stuff falling out of your giant binders this is the one for you .okay the heavy duty reference binder has an easy release mechanism for the paper it allows you to insert a cover of your choice and it holds up nicely when you tilt the binder so that the weight of the paper is against the clasp mechanism . we ve filled it with plastic sleeves which add to the weight but keep the papers neater . the stacked pockets in the front and back are handy for adding notecards papers that go with the contents in the binder but keep in mind they are slender pockets not meant to overstuff with materials . very happy with this binder and the white gives a nice crisp look to the shelf desk .
this thermometer seems faster then most thermometers i have used before but i have not verified the seconds claim i have only used it rectally on my baby because it is the most accurate way to get her temperature . the fact that the tip bends is very helpful because babies move a lot when you are trying to get their rectal temperature it must not be very pleasant . the thermometer folds quite compactly and the display is very clear and has a light . this is a great buy .helps me know exactly how my babies day has gone with my mother in law watching him while i go to work . it also has a section for her to write notes and let me know anything she may need . i couldn t be happier with this book .i received this thermometer as a shower gift . after reading the reviews posted here i decided to find out if mine was accurate . i tested it on myself against my other digital thermometer finding of a degree difference orally then against my braun thermoscan plus finding of a degree difference orally vs . ear . as my other digital is very old i don t know if the degree difference was from quality or age . while the difference with the braun may seem alarming it is actually quite normal . body temps read differently when taken axillary orally rectally and by thermoscan . there can actually be as much as one degree difference in the readings with axillary and oral reading lower than rectal and thermoscan . read your product info cards take a few readings and realize that thermometers do not read the same temp from different body locations . i am keeping my safety st thermometer . it s accurate and extremely affordable ! i will not use my braun on my infant until she s much older nearly all pediatricians want a rectal temperature anyway .
the picture doesn t match the product but it s still a great set . word of warning though don t try to sterilize the medicine dropper it melts !frame is cute . it has real weight to it so it doesn t feel or look cheap at all . note that it can only be used for verticle pictures because the images on the sides are set to be vericle .great product does what it needs to do if only the product works better for small baseboards under in . the template does not do well on baseboards since it will be short a few cm depend on how thick the baseboard is in depth .overall pretty sturdy
i purchased this item believing it to be fully compatible with mac os x . however i was unable to get it to work at all under mac os x . . nothing but chittering feedback sounds . i emailed the manufacturer directly about the problem and they responded unfortunately we do not currently have a timeline for mac os x . . support . we are sorry if your os is os x . . and would like to suggest that you return the mv to the retailer where you purchased the mv . disappointing !it is hard to find a printer that lists windows server as a compatible operating system . i tried some other brand printers and the drivers would refuse to install . even though canon support told me that this printer is not officially supported for server i installed the drivers anyway and it works perfect !pros . takes normal batteries . . bright well focused laser . . uses radio frequency communication not ir so you do not need line of sight to the computer . it will go through a wood podium . . works great with apple keynote and microsoft powerpoint . . works great with mac os x windows and linux . . no need to screw around with bluetooth .cons none

why didn t i think of this ? is what it is and does what it says its does . from martin nuff said !this behringer box is a very good tool effect i would recommend to anyone from beginner to pro . one thing should be noted the light is amber not blue and no volt battery is required . the device comes with a removable power cord which to me is a big plus .five stars because it works on my digitech gnx guitar processor which requires volts and about milli amps . this has an output of milli amps . for electronics the voltage has to be correct . but an appliance will only draw as many amps current as it needs . so this adapter is coasting when used with the guitar processor and can be used with other devices that draw up to the mamps . just be sure your v device doesn t require more than the ma this can deliver . but it s a power adapter i cannot be in love with a power adapter .
we have a king size bed and this thing is like sleeping with a third person . it takes up so much room and it too cumbersome to move around especially when you are dealing with a baby belly . it is impossible to put the pillow case it comes with back on it if you need to wash it . i wish i had bought a smaller one with a case that zipped .this is a great stroller ! it is so light weight and makes turning in narrow store isles so easy . one fold system makes it so nice to take out of trunk and out into trunk . i am going to miss the stroller when she reaches the lb weight limit and i can t use it anymore . i just love it ! ! !this is a nice bag . it is enormous . it holds everything i could ever think of taking for the baby . due to it s size i usually just keep this one in the car and use a smaller one to carry into places . bag is nice quality and doesn t have that cutesy look . my husband has no problem carrying it either .
it came in a square box with minimal assembly required . in fact you just need to attach the top flat portion of the scale and you are ready to go . battery is no included so you have to provide your own type c batteries you will need . i found it hard to remove the cover of the battery compartment but nothing to fuss about . you can use an ac adapter but you will have to buy it separatelyto tell you the truth the first thing i notice is how cheap the product looks . mine came in silver i probably would prefer the black . yet there is no sure way what color you will get . what i really like about it is the simplicity of the operation its functionality and its minimalistic design . there are only buttons on the front on off hold will hold the result for minutes tare will deduct the weight of the container if you use one very useful the other adjustment is located on the right side which cycle the units in to metric and differrent amounts .one other thing that is very practical is the detacheable faceplate . if you have a big box you will most likely cover the digital display which will require you to kneel to peek the display under the box . the faceplate can be extended outward with a spiral cord like the one you see on the older type of analog telephones .display is backlit . lb capacity . made in china .no setup required true plug and play . very convenient and portable . no need to have to instruct someone on how to use it just handit to the next presenter and they will be able to move about in the power point presentation with ease .i previously had a pt labeler i m replacing it with this new unit . it s lighter and still has all of the same functions as far as i can tell . a few menu options have been changed all symbols are now behind a menu and the key placement is much better e .g . shift keys . it works well for simple labels and they are easy to read on the white tape . cutter works well .the fact that it uses less batteries is great aaa though i don t know how long they ll last compared to the aa the pt used . also has a bigger display than the other unit making it easier to type longer labels .i can t really notice much of a difference with the lower dpi rating .overall if you can find a good deal on tape online you really can t go wrong with this unit for simple labeling needs .
fit my gallon long wide high just right . the two glass pieces came already inserted into the plastic piece that allows the glass to be lifted for feeding . the other extra plastic piece goes onto the rear glass piece in case you have filters in the back and need to cut slots out for them . however i don t use that plastic piece and have a inch and a half space that fits well for my filter and heater . it also comes with an attachable handle that makes it easier to lift the glass .this is a nice quality product really helped to reduce the noise . fit perfectly on my inch . tank the included plastic section was easy to cut to accommodate filters and other tank hardware .when you purchase one of their filters the intake tubes that come are generally too short . mine runs about of the way to the bottom and should be closest to the bottom as possible .
fits our toilet seat very without sliding and no space left on sides . does not wiggle when set correctly . suitable for boy or girl . classy not gaudy if you can say that of a toilet seat .this product really does fit all toilets . we used it on the road at a hotel and it fit on the hotel s elongated toilet . i highly recommend it .it fits the toilet seat very well . it doesn t slide from side to side . easy to use it s light . made in usa .
these insert able tab dividers are perfect for book reports office organization or creating training manuals . they are yellow in color and have the standard three hole punches in them . they fit into any standard binder and they have a plastic strip that runs along the hole punches so the paper doesn t rip . the paper is strong and not fragile at all . there are eight dividers and each one has it s own color and it comes with white labels .these file folders are sturdy and colorful .they are intended for attaching papers via a metal buckle on the top . so you punch two holes in the top of a paper or stack of papers unfold the metal buckle put the points through the paper holes and flatten .each folder has two internal dividers .the dividers i grew up with soon after the invention of fire and the wheel were thin manila paper with colored tabs adhered on the edge . you typed or wrote the section name on the included perforated labels the first time you used them dividers and painstakingly inserted the tiny slips of paper into the narrow tabs .wilson jones has reinvented the divider and done a great job of it . these dividers are plastic flexible tough lightweight . the tab is just an extension of the sheet itself . but here s the cool part instead of labeling each individual tab you print a master list that fits into the back of your binder the dividers go between the pages to be divided and you can see the name of the division through the colored transparent tab . just look at the picture . in this case a picture is worth words .it s a great innovation . and for someone who loves office supplies and craves organization these are a no brainer . my problem now is whether to use these to organize rescue dog information or building new house information . maybe another package of dividers is needed !unconditionally recommended .
good product suggested by me vet . for soreness in my dogs joints . product appears to give him some relief . delivery and price for this product was excellent .this product complies exactly what it promises biology is growing increasingly . the seachem products are excellent . recommend the use of this product .excellent product .
highly recommend these nipple shields for protection of your nipple but also for babies that are between the breast and bottle feeding . it s clears the nipple confusion instantly .these worked with the medela breast pump . two different sizes comes in the box . one size did work with the natural flow bottles .not all nipple shields are created equal . . . these don t stay on very well they are thick not nipple like and large . just fork up the money for a medela shield . . .
this can come in handy for different home projects and decorating . for example i decorated a huge bathroom mirror with small framed pictures using this double sided tape it looked great . perfect when you can t or don t want to ruin a wall with a nail . i also decorated the ceramic tile backsplash in the kitchen with the same sort of small framed pictures . the tape is not too hard to remove from the glass mirror tile surfaces but expect some difficulty when removing from painted walls . a little sanding of the residue is needed .phone looks and works fine . if you are looking for an affordable wall phone this is the one . just be sure to read the instructions concerning wall mount mode !i have used this product in both in the tape and squares form for many years . i live in california where we get many little earthquakes and i have grandchildren who occasionally slam doors so anything hanging on the walls could shift . i can t stand having mirrors pictures clocks etc . hanging crooked . i hang the object with a picture hangar which holds the weight but always put mounting tape at two corners which holds the frame straight on the wall . this mounting tape is permanent so place it where you want it to stay . i would never put it on the back of a clock for instance if the battery will need changing once a year . i have found it takes patience to remove it from any surface . this product is also useful for mounting on surfaces that cannot tolerate a nail or screw hole . scotch mounting tape is part of my tool box arsenal .
the uniden tcx offers all the same features as the handsets that came with several other multi handset uniden phones . it is a solid phone handset with the . gigahertz frequency ranking as one of this phone s greatest attractions . i have found that i can stray a good distance from the base and it will still function normally . my home and yard are not huge but i still had problems with fading signals with my older phone . i often had to reposition myself if i was outside in order to get my old cordless phone to receive the signal . but with uniden tcx there is no need to reposition myself or the phone . the signal is still clear even when i am standing in the corner of my property .the lcd display on the uniden tcx is nice . it isn t very large but it lights up in an orange color and it shows many bits of information like the date and time the phone number and name of a caller when an incoming call is trying to ring through a battery charge indicator an indicator telling you the number of different caller id s that have come through and an indicator telling you which handset you are using you can program each one with its own number . the lcd contrast and the ring volume can be adjusted on each handset making it customizable per room . you can even change the display to read in english spanish or french .uniden tcx is compatible with many different uniden phone systems . but in order for this expansion handset to work it must first be programmed with your main phone . this requires entering specific code numbers into your main phone s base unit . if you do not program the phone will not work . programming is simple instructions are included for programming into different main phones and it must be completed or the phone will be worthless .there are only a few things about the uniden tcx phone that are deserving of criticism . first it can get a little tedious trying to program new names and numbers and one needs to be careful not to get carried away because it can take a long time to get everything programmed just right using abbreviations is a good idea to speed up the process . second i don t like the flashing red light in the upper left hand corner of each handset . this is a charge indicator that lets you know the phone is charged and ready to go . there is nothing wrong with letting consumers know this but to have a light that continuously flashes can be a tremendous distraction . third the base is small and light and it can easily get knocked off the table or desk on which it rests . fourth i would prefer a plug that didn t have a block attached to it . this makes it easy to grip but it also means the plug has to be inserted a certain way or it will partially cover the electrical outlet directly underneath it .overall in spite of a few inconveniences i am still satisfied with the purchase of my uniden trx handset and i may add another one or two handsets like it in the future . they sell for a reasonable price and they are compatible with many different uniden phones . clear sound slim design and countless features make this auxiliary phone a nice addition to any uniden household in need of extra phone units .august . i purchased two of these phones to wall mount in my basement and garage . they work meaning they ring but i get complaints about voice quality on every call . cost was . each with free shipping assuming the order totaled at least . despite some remarks that these phones can not be wall mounted those statements are simply not true . i have two of these phones both of which are currently wall mounted . as noted in the instructions you must reverse a clip on the base unit for wall mounting . that clip then provides a tab hook that keeps the phone firmly in place on the base unit . this type of arrangement is essentially universal to all phones that i ve ever seen that can be both used horizontally or vertically . to switch the tab from horizontal to vertical mounting took less than seconds .another bit of confusion . a few reviewers state that the cord from the base to phone is hard wired and can not be replaced with a longer one . that is not true at least in . the cord has standard clips on both ends and can be replaced at will .yet despite that mis information i m very disappointed with the voice quality . every time i answer these phones people complain unsolicited about the voice quality . a hard wired phone as opposed to a cordless should sound great but clearly these phones don t ! your only real option for a better hard wired phone would be a panasonic at about . .first of all you don t have to go to . . . and register in order to download the template . you can download from microsoft s website . i accessed it quickly by searching woord s online help . click download accept terms follow prompts and such then you will be prompted to enable macros in word . once that process is complete a few mins you re all set to start creating . you ll want to adjust the save as option make sure you save it in your docs or wherever you keep templates otherwise it goes into a preset ms folder and you may never find it again ! it s very user friendly . this is not your most basic avery label where you insert directly onto the template . rather you insert text and photos from a separate on screen window . you can add different pictures on each tab left or right position easy browse and insert from your pictures or the same pic on all tabs . same with text . click ok to view template and if you need to edit click edit text or pictures on the toolbar and the screen returns . changes are made quickly enough with a visible progress bar . fonts can be easily tested out and edited ctrl a to select all on the actual template then scroll through several preset fonts to see the changes before your eyes without final editing then click the one you like best to make the changes final . you can also access and use msword s full set of installed fonts by clicking create new theme fonts and saving as custom .the template automatically prints in black size . what i have not found is how to quickly change the entire page s font colors and sizes . the only way that has worked for me is to select the text on each individual label and then apply a new color or size from word home off the avery template toolbar back onto the word toolbar . i have tried several tricks nothing has worked . this is unfortunate as color coding can be an extremely helpful and effective way to access specific tabbed sections of information .the template screen gives you the option to start on any row you choose which is a great way to conserve template sheets since you may not use every label on the sheet every time . you can print more than one set at a time and then collate or group .overall i really like these and i will forgive the color and size faux pas for now . but these options would be a nice update to the label for future editions .
i purchased this two years ago for one reason to have a phone i can use when the power goes out which happens several times a year .modern phones are terrific . . . as long as they have electric power . when the power goes out however they are helpless . i do have a deep cycle battery and power inverter for when the power goes out but having this basic phone allows me to have a phone without drawing power from my deep cycle battery . i can check with the power company talk with neighbors and potentially most important if there s an emergency i can immediately dial for help .everyone who owns a phone that plugs into an electric outlet and who lives in an area likely to experience power outages should have one of these for when the power fails . just store it in a location that s easy to access when you have no lights .it must have been the day i fried my cisco router when i decided i needed a way to mark the myriad power supplies for my electronics . turns out that my cisco voip phone and cisco router require different types of electrical power the power supplies for both devices fit into each device and plugging the wrong power supply into a cisco router wrecks it .this ink pen does a great job of writing on the black plastic so common with modern electronics . no more confusion about what power supply plugs into what device . trying to fit a plug into a device is not a sound method of determining power requirements . reading the miniscule script on the device is perhaps not an option for you either given most americans know more about lady gaga s eating habits than the difference between a volt and an amp . no idiot proof your life and use these pens to label your stuff so you don t find out the hard way it s the wrong power supply for your device .when you need a phone during an emergency or power outage when you want a phone that is reliably located on the base where someone hasn t walked away with the handset this is the ideal phone ! the phone comes with a longish cord to plug into the phone base and phone jack . if you need the standard short cord to use with a typical wall mounted base there is a slot under the base to wrap the cord instead of providing a shorter second cord . i like this ! it s nice that companies are engineering with cost savings in mind ! the phone comes with pulse and tone dialing needed to use computerized dialing . 
like the filter and hate there cheap made parts . all plastic parts are cheap and break easy . keep one extra as you have to clean the propeller when you service the filter causing the tabs to break when removed .these are one of the most popular treats we ever purchased . i like that this product is american made . the pieces are lightweight cubes and odor free .container is made in a pretty heavy duty plastic the hinge where the lid connects to the container is pretty weak but aside from that the rest is pretty well made . the lid has a strip of rubber foam along the outside edge where it comes into contact with the lid of the container which provides an airtight seal .generally speaking pretty easy to use and is as described .
no where on the description does it say that the mic clip is not included . the only place is on the box after you have received the item . there s no instruction which is fine . but in the product description it doesn t say that you must purchase the mic clip separately or you can t use it .i bought this and have it shipped second day because i need to use it and now i can t because it doesn t come with a mic clip which i have to spend another to get it plus shipping . the price is the stand is reasonable had it included the mic clip . but without it i felt cheated .sadly i can t review the mic itself nor the cable that comes with the mic as they were both non responsive . i tried the mic with other cables i have lying around that i know work and i got nothing it was like the mic wasn t plugged in at all . and the cable included in this pack well the plastic not metal connector to the mic was cracked . i still tried it with a difference mic . . . static .i can t blame amazon for the broken bits as the whole thing was packed well and the box did not appear damaged .the stand that comes with this set up seems really good for the price of the whole package . i was impressed at how much of is isn t plastic .still . . . i can t recommend this product .a little disappointed with the cable . pretty light weight . don t know why it didn t work just shorted out . luckily one of the band members had another one . wouldn t trust it again so i returned them .
i read the directions twice then installed taking less than minutes and i am pretty clueless with putting things together . one thing that should be changed is it says on the outside that a drill should be used but the directions says not to use a drill . the screws are small so a drill would be pointless . i like that it comes with paper guides so you only screww once and it is where it needs to be the first time instead of trial and error making many holes in cabinet .this gate is grate especially if you have pets and stairs . the only thing i didn t like about the gate is how hard it is to bend configure each panel of the gate .easy to use easy to install and it has so many different options of installation extensions y spindles stairway adaptors and all were easy to figure out . even my plus mother said it was easy to figure out how to use it without any instruction . really liked how the bottom supports that press against the wall were flat on the bottom edge so they lay against the floor better . my other brand of gate didnt have that . only complaint was my box had no directions in it . but managed without them .
i use these pens every day . we buy them by the box ! does anyone ever remember what we did without sharpies ? i would rather use a sharpie than a pen . we use them in several pen tip sizes and we buy them by the box or the large package . each pen size has its own benefit but they all feature permanent ink for most surfaces . the fine tip is good for marking on boxes and writing on cds and dvds you make . the ink is permanent fast drying and water resistant but you can take it off some surfaces with rubbing alcohol . especially right after you write on something with it like a cd . we write the purchase date on stored food items or medicine bottles to always use the oldest first . we also mark the spare packages of batteries with the expiration date to use the older ones first . there are limitless uses for these permanent marking pens . we have used other types of pens but the sharpies have the best pen tips and last the longest . just keep the cap on after you are done . we love these pens and they are in every drawer of the house .we buy them by the box ! does anyone ever remember what we did without sharpies ? i would rather use a sharpie than a pen . we use them in several pen tip sizes and we buy them by the box of . each pen size has its own benefit but they all feature permanent ink for most surfaces . the fine tip is good for marking on boxes and writing on cds and dvds you make . the ink is permanent fast drying and water resistant but you can take it off some surfaces with rubbing alcohol . especially right after you write on something with it like a cd . we write the purchase date on stored food items or medicine bottles to always use the oldest first . we also mark the spare packages of batteries with the expiration date to use the older ones first . there are limitless uses for these permanent marking pens . we have used other types of pens but the sharpies have the best pen tips and last the longest . just keep the cap on after you are done . we love these pens and they are in every drawer of the house .i got these for my children to use for their backpacks books lunch boxes and clothes for school . they stay on really well and are made of a flexible rubbery like material . i also use them for the kids water bottles . even after a day on the water bottle the labels are still fine . i print up a sheet for each child and they are always ready to go . if they can last a few days on a kid they d work out great for use as name badges for adults who aren t so rough .
i ll just say newbie to ukulele no idea how to tune it instructions online say gcea i put this on the head plucked each string tuned the machine head until it said dead on and that was it . i keep this clipped to my ukulele standinstrument stand for violin ukulele and other small instruments see my reviews of it it s so so the stand and just turn it on and tune the uke before i take it off the stand . only time will tell how these little nickel watch battery style battery lasts i find them a bear to buy but time will tell . anyhow i concur with the reviews on here glad i listened to them and for any brand new ukulele players out there this is the one to get . c yathis is my first slide i never use slide to play my guitar look good size is right for me . i just have to learn how to use it you can never go wrong buying a kyser capo . they are made to last and really do what they are designed to do . the great thing about this capo is that it fits both my banjo and mandolin so i don t have to have a seperate capo for each .i also have a capo for guitar made by kyser and i can tell you that works just as well . you can never go wrong with a kyser . not only that i like the idea that it s an us company . i ve had some cheaper capos and they just don t do the job . they either don t press down on the strings hard enough or they wear out too quickly if they get used much . this kyser will last a long long time .

do i know if they are effective ? i have no clue ! do you ? but they do taste great ! the only negative is that they do not hold up to the humidity when i have them in my weekly vitamin holder . they get soggy and hard to handle .not a fan . doesnt really do much . im a groomer and was hoping it would do what everyone was saying .worked but we didn t need to use it much ! it does what it says it will do though ! good product .
this review is for the universal bedside co sleeper which is exactly the same as the original except it s sized for beds that are inches tall the original is sized for beds that are inches tall and taller .after only a few weeks of using a traditional high sided cradle for our baby who gets up to nurse several times in a night we decided that we needed something to make moving the baby between her bed and ours easier . we chose the bedside co sleeper and we haven t been disappointed .the low side of the co sleeper is level with our mattress and the mattress of the co sleeper is about inches lower than that . this means that when my baby wakes in the middle of the night to nurse i only have to lift her four inches to get her into my bed . i don t even have to sit up to manage this . plus since there are no bars or slats between her bed and mine when she s fussy at night i can easily reach out a hand to soothe her or find the pacifier she s let slip from her mouth . the four outside pockets one on each short end and two on the long end are convenient for holding burp cloths extra diapers baby wipes etc everything i need for late night feeding and changing .some reviewers have complained that the mattress is too hard . actually i found that the mattress is padded but lumpy . this is because it s designed to fold up so the co sleeper can be portable and fit into a travel bag . i solved the problem by putting a quilted multi use pad on top of the mattress underneath the fitted sheet . the quilting helped smooth out the lumps and make the mattress more comfortable without making it so soft that i m worried about a smothering hazard . also the pad is good protection for the mattress in case of nighttime accidents since the mattress is made only of cloth with no plastic cover unlike typical cradle mattresses . be sure to buy at least one extra fitted sheet when you purchase the bed one is included with the bed itself since regular crib or cradle sheets won t fit .my only complaint so far is that the solid fabric sides of the co sleeper prevented me from hanging my baby s crib toys on the bed . otherwise i ve found this bed to be an absolute lifesaver and the only kind of infant bed i would recommend .this fits our crib mattress tightly and keeps our baby from sweating against the vinyl of the crib mattress . we didn t have a mattress pad with our son and he would wake up soaking wet from sweating against the vinyl of the crib mattress . the crib sheet alone wasn t enough to keep him from sweating . this pad is also not too bulky so it doesn t cause a safety concern . just make sure the pad fits tightly on your crib mattress for safety s sake . we have a sealy crown jewel mattress and it fits great on it .this is the best crib sheet out there ! it can be simply used by itself by just fastening the straps to the sides of the crib or can be used with a more decorative sheet simply placed snugly in place over it .my daughter is now months and has leaked out of her diaper on occassion the mattress that she sleeps on cost around . so thanks to this sheet the mattress still looks the same as it did when we brougt it home .
i love labels or anything that makes life easier . i am very organized both at work and at home . labels make things so much more convenient and quicker .i love these labels . they don t necessarily have to be used with a printer they can be written on . and the reason i say this is because these labels are for laser printers and i have ink jet printers . therefore i can still use these because i can write on them rather than running them through the printer .there are a variety of uses for labels . in addition to addresses files and other office reasons they can be used for jars boxes etc .awesome product .i think these labels are a very good all purpose label not just for an inkjet printer as you can use these by hand too .not only to label file folders or to label cd cases but i would also use these for just about anything i want to label like when i buy something in bulk and freeze it . i always like to label what the item is as well as when i froze it .these labels look white but when you peel them off they are clear . you can use either a pen or marker on them .the label size is ample so you can write what you need to on it . i have some labels just like this but they are white . i think i prefer these clear labels .i did find them alittle hard to see where one label ends and another one begins . i like that they come in a pack of . i doubt i will have to buy anymore of this size label in my lifetime .iam very happy with these labels .i have been using the black bic mark it marker for years to label just about anything and everything and address labels packages for my etsy business . i have always loved the smooth consistency with which they write strong color and staying power . how excited i was to get this color set ! the fun and options are now endless . . . . .
was able to secure a foot bookcase without any issues . screws were not a problem . always possible for a long screw to break just drill a pilot hole . straps seemed sturdy . if you want them flush to the wall you need to install the wall piece well below the piece attached to the unit several inches . i measured the crib before purchasing this but it was not a hood fit for our standard jenny lind crib . some of the elastic snaps could not stretch far enough to snap closed so they just hung thee . it did not make me feel comfortable to have those straps dangling since they could have been a potential choking hazard .i love this gadget . i bought two extra bases for my infant car seat for both my husband s and my mother s car . unlike my car there center seat has a harness strap . those are hard to get really tight . my center seat has just the lap belt and it was easy to secure the base . with the harness strap it was just too hard to get the seat in tight enough . with the mighty tight it was a snap . you just hooked it in cranked it and voula ! ! !that seat isn t going anywhere . i love it . it is easy to use it makes the seat secure and it is sturdy . you must have this if you are trying to secure a seat in a position with a shoulder harness .

this fits our crib mattress tightly and keeps our baby from sweating against the vinyl of the crib mattress . we didn t have a mattress pad with our son and he would wake up soaking wet from sweating against the vinyl of the crib mattress . the crib sheet alone wasn t enough to keep him from sweating . this pad is also not too bulky so it doesn t cause a safety concern . just make sure the pad fits tightly on your crib mattress for safety s sake . we have a sealy crown jewel mattress and it fits great on it .we registered for the ultimate crib sheet because a cousin and a few friends raved about it they said to get two so that one could be on the crib and one could be in the wash . i received it at my baby shower but we have found only limited value in this crib sheet for our month old daughter . i am glad we only have one of these !the ultimate crib sheet that we have is the style with elastic straps on each corner one fully removable elastic strap in the center of the short end and two straps on each long end . we have a pali wendy in convertible crib and the corner posts are quite thick to the point where the elastic straps are not long enough to easily go around the corners . instead on one end of the crib we have to resort to wrapping the straps around the crib slats adjacent to the corner posts and that means there s slightly less than full coverage of the sheet underneath . since our daughter is a perimeter sleeper who likes to be up against the edges of her crib that is a problem .the majority of parents we know have purchased convertible cribs which have thick corner posts when configured as a crib or toddler bed . it would be easy for summer infant to make this sheet more adaptable to current crib styles by making the length of the corner straps longer or using multiple snap sockets to make the strap length adjustable . this sheet fits better on a standard traditional crib with thinner diameter corner posts .i also question the real value of this for older babies who move around in their cribs . we have the crib bumper on now despite not having used it between months of age because she is a real mover and likes to stay on the perimeter of her crib to sleep she was sticking limbs out between crib slats and woke up crying as a result . on the handful of occasions where she s thrown up in her crib always when she s come down with an upper respiratory bug she s inevitably hosed the bumper as well . in those cases we have to just strip the whole crib anyways so the ultimate crib sheet is of little real utility for us .i could see this being a big time saver for parents with traditional cribs or those with babies toddlers who often have various accidents in their cribs and need to frequently change a crib sheet on the fly . however we have found that a waterproof pad under a normal crib sheet works just fine for our baby .this crib rail guard did stop by toddler from chewing on the wood rails of her crib . it stuck on well enough and fit well over the wood of the front of the crib too but the plastic has a sticky feel to it even the upright side that isn t supposed to stick to anything . i noticed when putting the baby in the crib her blanket or clothes would sometimes stick to it . i ended up buying the cloth crib rail guards which look better and can be put in the washing machine . i d recommend the cloth tie on rail guards over this one .
while it does not kill all the algae in the tank it does help control the algae and cuts down on needed cleaning and water changes needed to maintain your tank .when used regularly it seems to do a good job . my dog does not get fleas or ticks and she does go outsidedoes not remove or transform nitrates and nitrites . good for preventative use and general upkeep of your glorious tank . yeah .
this is a great filter and it is versatile to add your own filter media suited to your needs . it is also cheap to maintain .i have a planted tank so i do not use the activated carbon as it removes nutrients from the water that plants use . instead i use a layer of filter floss . i also use a layer of shpagnum peat moss in a filter media bag above the the sponge and floss below the bio which helps the ph and fertilizes the plants .some users complained about the noise . this is an easy fix .first of all this filter is not for use with sand ! it will make a grinding noise if you use it with sand . gravel is okif you do use it with sand you can take the motor housing apart and spray water into the spinning fan to remove as much little dirt as you can it should be quieter if you do this .for all uses if you hear a rumbling noise this is an easy fix basically use vaseline or silicon grease to lubricate the propeller shaft .refer to the manual as follows take out the motor part i remove the propeller little white thing part g and put lubrication right on the propeller shaft in the middle part h . make sure you rub it up down with the propeller to ensure good lubrication .don t foget to secure your filters push them down tight and fill the unit up with water before you plug it in again .voila ! noise is gone !aquaclear really knows how to make a filter . this one comes with filter tubes for taller aquariums and i recommend getting a filter max iii prefilter as it fits it perfectly and adds an extra layer to the already tier filtration it provides . i say since the intake tube is the foam insert is a carbon filter and then it comes with a bio max which is a cylinder shaped bacteria holder and i tend to put just because . you can put almost anything in here whether it s one of those cut it yourself inserts any kind of seachem or purigen mesh bags and you can pretty much reuse half of what it gives . it recommends replacing the foam every months but i just swish and squish it in some leftover water change water same with the bio max if it gets grodey looking . the prefilter helps with that . it can be moved with the little piece on top from gal gal i have a and keep at since you cannot over filter . if you re going to get this and have a filter already make sure you leave this in for about months t make sure the bacteria gets in this filter from your other one .don t waste your time with all these other hob filters if you are going to get a hob then get an aquaclear . they are the best but you already know that if you are looking at this .my favorite things about them first you can put any media you want in here remove the carbon unlike some filters out there they come with biomax already great stuff second you can just wash the filter media use old tank water only if you must clean the filter third you can swap the impellers so for instance you can put a aquaclear filter on your g tank and just put a smaller impeller from the model in !
i prefer shar s overture premieres which are the same price . these ones are a little too bright in sound and not deep or resonant enough . also bear in mind these are not dominants which are clearly far superior but for which you would be paying a set .i use this all the time . it s pretty basic but really good for a beginner . not all chords are in here but the core chords are . worth the price unless you know what you re doing these things are too small . if you feel comfortable with your picking skills the size and stiffness along with the built in grip are pretty good . these are for lead and not rhythm . the picture won t show it but they are about the size of a dime .
works with myon stage ks classic double x keyboard standi got it to attach my mic to it using this stand by on stage as wellon stage msa tb adjustable microphone boom blackworks as advertised . you just twist the knob to apply pressure so it fits in the tube .also comes with the stopper so you can quickly remove this attachment bar and reattach it .i purchased this for use with a sennheiser e s microphone and the bestselling on stage boom microphone stand . the mount has exceeded my expectations . the fit for the stand is perfect with the mount pivoted so that the mike can be adjusted up or down . the part actually holding the mike is flexible and rubbery making it very easy to slide the mike and its cord in and out . a screw tightens te pivot if this needs to be fixed more firmly in place . all in all a very worthwhile and economical purchase .this hanger is very well padded and the padding can be adjusted to custom fit your guitar . it holds the guitar perfectly spaced from the wall .
like most other reviewers here i found this finger toothbrush to be very hard to use .i would say i have average size hands for ex i wear a size medium adult male snowboarding glove .the finger toothbrush has a very large opening way too large for my fingers . and for my wife not a chance she could get it to stay on her finger .the bristles are too short and very close together . i don t think it really scrubs anything .i am going back to using a regular style toothbrush like the ones humans use . i have found that a toothbrush made for a baby works pretty well on dogs small dogs like mine .these little treat bags are so great ! the fanny pack type treat bag i had been using was a pain to wear with certain jackets and outfits whereas this tote can be clipped on to anything . plus you really do only need to use one hand which frees the other up for a clicker if that s part of your training method .use this after clipping my hairy dog and it cleans those blades good ! i love being able to get all the hair out of them . every time i open it i m surprised it s not aerosol though ! odd design on the can !
the size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous . the funnel is long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only long . it states that the funnel is x but in reality the opening for the funnel is in diameter at the widest point .it would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless .a good made in usa chock . it may cost about a buck less each at walmart if you can find it .there is a hole in the side for a rope to hold one or two together for each side of the tire . don t buy the one with a rope . it costs twice as much for the same one chock not two .the heavy rubber buyers rubber wheel chock in .w model wc a at . each at northern tools are heavier and provides a better grip on concrete but they are heavy to carry around . i use the buyers ones in the garage and carry the camco ones in my trunk .also note that the buyer s ones are made in the same place as the expensive race ramps branded ones costing more . the buyers ones are nearly identical are exactly the same size and weight . the race ramps ones have shallow slits cut into the bottom .need for each side works well for small pop up . buy these over ones w rope and add your own rope same choke . these already have the hole for rope . dimensions given are inaccurate on these two they are exactly the same size .
these work very well with a medela pump in style advanced system . we tried the others available on amazon in plastic bag much cheaper and kind of misleading you into thinking they are medela brand . . . these work soooo much better especially for the high volume exclusive pumping needs we have with no breast feeding . why spend extra time pumping ?through a series of unfortunate events i ve come to own six different manual breast pumps and two electric ones . my manuals include the lansinoh the medela harmony and two generations of avent pumps . this is how they compare from worst to best medela harmony manual breast pump . i own the freestyle so i thought that i would like the medela brand manual . not so . the valve system on this pump is a thin flip attached to hard plastic . it simply does not generate as much suction as the sturdier lansinoh and avent valves and therefore it does not trigger let down as well or get as much milk . if this is the only pump you have you might not realize it because you will still get some milk but when i compared it to my avent it was taking about five minutes longer and getting an ounce less per breast . i liked that you could switch out the breast cup to accommodate different nipple sizes and assembly was slightly easier but it does not have the massage cushion which makes it a little less comfortable . of course the lack of cushion also means that milk can t get stuck in teh cushion and leak like the other three pumps so it s good and bad . but the bottom line is that i have supply problems so i just couldn t settle for a pump that generated less milk . it s in the garbage now . avent isis manual breast pump aka the older model avent . these pumps are comfortable to use and generate a lot of milk but the valve system is a small dime sized piece of plastic that pops out while pumping and easily gets lost . fortunately you can now buy replacement valves that are inch long pieces of sturdy flexible plastic . those are a must for avent users .philips avent comfort breast pump valves . also even though i like this pump it is annoying that it collects milk in the cushion and spills easily . it shares this problem with the newer comfort avent and the lansinoh but not the medela which does not have cushion . lansinoh manual breast pump count . this pump is cheaper than the avent and uses the same type of valve so unlike the medela it is almost as effective as the avent at getting milk . it also takes standard size bottles including medela even flo etc which is an advantage if you don t already use avent bottles . still i prefer the avent for two reasons first the massage cushion on the avent has petal air pockets that i like and second the lansinoh takes much more effort to pump . my hand gets tired within five or ten minutes of using this pump which is not a problem i ve had with either the medela or avent pumps . i think it is because the diaphragm on the lansinoh is much thicker . so well i can see certain advantages to this lansinoh cost bottles it s not my favorite . philips avent bpa free manual breast pump aka the newer model avent . these pumps are the best . the most comfortable to use the short neck can be placed right next to the breast . they also get the most milk without making my hand tired . the only disadvantages are that they are somewhat harder to assemble than the medela and can t accommodate different nipple sizes cost more than the lansinoh and require special avent shaped bottles usually included . still the assembly difference is small and i can learn to control milk spill . comfort and milk matter most to me so i enjoy this pump the most . if heaven forbid i need a seventh breast pump i will buy another one of these .i didn t use these for long as i switched from avent to tommee tippee due to baby having problems with fussiness due to gas . the products work as described with no leaking and attach easily to my medela pump . love that you can buy the avent in a two pack for your double pump . i had to buy the tommee tippee converters individually .
works great with my baritone ukulele . same quality as my full size acoustic guitar capo . easily fits in my ukulele case too .as a lot of epiphone owners have learned cases designed for the gibson es clones won t fit epiphone guitars as the epiphones have a slightly larger headstock . this case however fits my dot custom like a glove . the padding is perfect the top is arched to precisely fit the guitar and the build quality is better than you might expect at this price level .this stand is designed to work on electric guitars not acoustic or acoustic electric guitars . the arms that support the guitar are short and not adequate for acoustic guitars . this is however perfect for my lp and sg guitars . i love its size and portability .
minimal instructions doesn t even tell how to install the batteries ! really ? the company can t even paste a photo of how to open the weird battery compartment ? ?revision oops . correct battery compartment door was partly covered by a label saying don t immerse in water . i had been trying to open the door covering the circuit assembly on the bottom which looked just like a battery compartment door ! fairly easy to install the batteries once i found the correct door ! still this is the first product i ve ever seen without any kind of indication of where to put the batteries .the instructions also say something about a beeper function again the instructions don t say how . i called customer care who was prompt polite and helpful and they confirmed this is a feature not enabled on this product .update have used it for a few months no problems . i use it to give my dog meds when i m at work by mixing the pills in a gob of peanut butter . occasionally he spits out a pill but that s not a major problem or the fault of the feeder .momentary rant when you manufacture a product outside of this country how much does it cost to show the respect to your customers of having the instructions properly written and translated ?it says this will fit my powerhead from the same company but i seriously just can t figure out how . i have tried every modification possible and have looked at diagrams online and on the directions included and googled and youtubed . nothing . . . so its just sitting in my cabinet waiting for a magical hand to make it fit on there .don t know if its because of something else but at least in my setup this doesnt weem to be doing anything .
this notebook has two lines at the top with spaces for the date and the page . oddly the pages if you count both sides don t have preprinted numbers . the rest of the page has a two column format with rather faintly preprinted numbered lines on the right side and a narrower column of unlined space at the left . each page is perforated so you can easily tear it out at need . the covers are sturdy plastic ? . the paper is of acceptable quality for an item you will probably discard once it s full . useful for anyone who frequently wants to hand write lists or even instructional steps with annotations .this expandable file is sturdy and well constructed . it is a perfect size for letter size documents . it is not recommended for legal size documents . they are inches long and will have to be folded to fit . use the longer version of the expanding file for those . back to the matter at hand . . .this file will hold hundreds of pages . it seems quite durable and should last quite a while .the m tm copy holder in line inches wide sheet capacity is meant to be used for holding documents and books while using the computer . but i m thinking it would prove handy for booklovers who had to curtail their book reading because they couldn t hold the book comfortably for whatever reason . this stand is on the large side . the copy holder will take up about space lengthwise is wide but that means most books magazines can be open so both pages show at once . it fits on our tv trays . my mother in law was an avid reader but had to give it up because of hand tremors . how can you read when the book or magazine you re holding is in constant motion ? this copy holder would have been perfect for her . it might even work in a hospital setting could be used on the tray to set up for the bed bound patient . of course i can t be sure of this without trying it .i will use the dh when i crochet to follow along in instruction manuals at the pc to hold documents books once in a while to hold a thick heavy book that i m reading . the elastic band reminds me of my daughter s elastic head wraps and is adjustable up down for books documents of all lengths . being elastic means it can hold different thicknesses from a single page document thin magazine to a thick manual . i tested it with a page cookbook had no problems with it . i also put a pound box of canned dog food on it to test for weight it held nicely as long as the copy holder s tray base the piece that holds the book document was on the table . i m not sure how long the threads will last as everything is plastic but the screw .there is a year limited warranty which does not include normal wear tear .
great seat fits well on toilet my son loves it . comfortable . great quality . we also have the baby bjorn potty so they make great products .i bought this seat when our daughter was around months old because i though quot how cool a papasan for the baby that vibrates like her bouncy seat quot . wrong the worst things about this seat are as follows the vibrate times out the baby even at this early age could not be tucked because her feet went beyond the edge of the seat . the good things the seat is incredibly cute it would have been great when she was a new newborn because you could tuck her all snuggly like newborns usually like and she would have only needed the vibrate on for a few minutes to soothe her . that said i would not recommend this seat as a purchase must since the good do not outweigh the bad in my oppinion . my cat did howeever finally put this seat to good use claiming it as his own new bed and he does like the vibrate but not the music this is such a simple idea and thankfully effective . it isn t huge but it fits our convertible car seat and also the booster one seat protector for each car seat . i recommend it if you want to keep your seats in good shape . a towel works well too but not for boosters .
i bought these heating disks for the stray cat s outside . they are wonderful we heat them at night and during the harsh winter day s and they keep those poor animals outside warm .i use this heating pad for the feral cats houses . it kept them very warm in cold new york winterswe needed a way to keep our pound chihuahua warm all night during our cold pacific northwest winters . he lays on it all night and sleeps well . i was surprised at how small and heavy it was also it is hard plastic on the outside i never thought the dog would cuddle on it . . but he did !
api products have never failed me . their products are above what they could be . high quality . i have never used anything other then rena api products . thank youive been using seachem prime as well as other seachem products for many years because they work . prime is a great product that does what it says it does .everybody already knows or should know this product . works great does what it s supposed to and as long as the price remains reasonable i will continue to buy it .
i purchased these to increase my light output on my motorcycle . it is an improvement over the standard w low beam that was in there .i wanted upgrade the gear oil in my new mustang gt and selected royal purple because of its reputation and durability . it is noteasy to distinguish between the oils in the gears but i certainly noticed a difference using rp in my speed transmission .used this on my bmw ci for my transmission fluid change . noticed an immediate difference on how the car shifts . i would recommend this product to all bmw owners
this is the second kidco product i have purchased . let me start by saying that their products are some of the safest out there and i have every confidence in the security of the gates i have installed . but the first gate i purchased was the standard gateway that uses hardware to install . you can see my review there but the thing that is pertinent here is that they only included limited hardware in the box which would not work safely if installing the gate into dry wall even when there is a stud . so instead of including another set of screws that would ve cost them about . kidco likes to make busy parents go buy that stuff themselves .well this gate has its own torturous surprise for busy parents who are trying to multitask every hour of the day . kidco kindly includes two extensions making this gate much more versitile than most on the market . the thing they don t tell you is that these extensions are held in by the same tension that holds the gate into the wall . each of these tension screws are completely separate from one another which is good design because it allows installation over uneaven surfaces . however because there is no mechanism holding these extensions into place this means that the parent installing the gate must use two hands to hold up the gate make sure each of the separate extension brackets and two separate support bars and the metal extension bars which the brackets slide over none of which lockinto place in anyway don t fall off all the while trying to tighten one tension screw at a time . . . i cannot even explain to you how two limbs are not enough to get the job done and still remain sane by the end of the process .throw me a bone kidco ! how about the brackets clip or screw that holds the brackets into place so they don t slide off while i m trying to mount the gate ? something ! ? !unfortunately you will find that kidco often makes the best products for this kind of thing but they sure do cut corners on the little stuff that would make a parent s life a lot easier .i just installed these a couple of days ago so i will downgrade my review if i have any problems in the future . mine came with a m tape and the installation seems very sticky . they are certainly installed firmly enough that my toddler daughter will not be able to pull them off and that was the whole point . the only reasons i knocked off a couple stars are . the installation tape comes in pre cut strips so you have to use several of them . it would have been better if they sent a roll of the double sided tape instead . if the tape was in one roll that would also make installation of the foam strip easier because you could put one piece of tape on the foam and just pull the backing away from the two ends to get it aligned properly before pulling off the rest of the backing and securing the middle of the strip to the table . . the foam strip develops something of a shape memory from being rolled up in the package and by the time you get to the center of the roll you really have to fight against that curved shaped to install the tape and get the strip installed on the table in a straight manner . it would have been better if it came in strips perhaps two foot strips or four foot strips but i do realize this would have also increased the shipping cost . . there were no directions included . i am sure there must have been some things that would have made installation easier but they included no directions other than simple pictures showing to put the tape on the foam and stick the foam on the table .as with everything about being a parent locks are more complicated than you d have thought or would like ! screw mounted magnetic locks the safety st tot lok locks can be difficult to install especially on drawers but have more flexibility about where you can install the lock than the adhesive locks and seem very secure . still most people may want to try the adhesive locks see below first to make it easier to get some child proofing done quickly .pros very nice secure once installed especially since the fit can be adjusted to give a tight lock when closed . works vertically or horizontally . . . that is on the side of a door or the top . can easily be switched to hold the lock open for when no children are aroundcons complicated to install especially in some situations . so you might not get around to installing them given all the other demands on your time . requires drilling a hole partway through the cabinet door from the inside for the magnetic part plus some small holes to attach may require some new tools a collar lock to keep from drilling through the door and a right angle chuck for tight spacesif you plan to be in your home for a while and want a finished secure set of locks the tot loks may be a good choice .one note if you use them often the magnetic key will wear the finish where it rubs .adhesive mount magnetic locks the kidco adhesive mount magnet locks will only work in some spots but it s still a good lock to try first for a lot of people because it works well in the right situations and is easy to install . buy some and see how they work on your cabinets . once you ve tried a few it s a lot easier to see where ll they ll work or won t work .pros quick to install after a few minutes of figuring it out no drilling required so less work and no damage to furniture or cabinetscons only installs horizontally along the top edge of a door or drawer given the way they use gravity to lock .we just use the adhesive mount no additional screws for some furniture we didn t want to drill holes into . they seem to be strong enough so far especially since our kids seem to give up trying a door after a while if it won t open they lose interest . i don t know how the adhesive would stand up to long term use or really heavy pulling .hook locks the advantage that either of the magnetic locks has over the old fashioned hook type like themommy s helper safe lok cabinet door and drawer lock is that the hooks have a lot more play they have to open a little bit to give you access to the lock . so a child can bang them back and forth they might not open the door or drawer but they will make a racket . maybe ok in some situations but not a great solution for easily accessible drawers or doors .slide locks slide locks such as theamerican red cross cabinet safety slide lock are very quick and easy to install if they fit . but they can also be pretty easy for some kids to unlock so if they are within reach they aren t much of a barrier to older kids . and even younger kids can sometimes open them by pulling or pushing on the doors . however they are a good temporary solution and can be useful to carry when you travel .flex locks flex locks like the safety first cabinet flex lock see reviews orcabinet flex lock pack are strong and easy to install and you can see by looking at them whether the lock is secure unlike the magnetic locks which are designed to be out of sight . so you might want to use them for critical spots such as under the sink or use them when you travel . and as a bonus they are so secure that even some adults can t open them ! they do take two hands to open . not attractive but they do the job if you keep them tightened .
ordered this to put on top of my floor jack which was diameter but it did not fit it was just sitting on top loosely . so i m giving it stars if it fits your application i d imagine it would be rated highly . so it s back to either a puck or wood for me .please click yes if my review have been helpful to you it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews and leave a comment if you have any questions i will be more than happy to answer if i can be of help .this is a nice sturdy guage to check spark plug gap . however it has only an inch scale with no metric equivalent on the reverse side . so if you plan on gapping your plug to a metric value forget this guage . even so it felt good to use and not at all flimsy . it s smoothly finished and the marking are clear and legible making it easy to read . well worth what i paid for it .ps . another reviewer said the one he received had the metric markings on the back side . i found no such markings on mine perhaps the one i received was defective . in any event that doesn t alter my rating . i still like it .when ordering this ball i didn t realize the dimensions . i know they come in two sizes but didn t realize how big it really is until i opened the amazon box today . . .no biggie it ll still work . if your planning on doing rims or small areas you should get the little guy ! great buy though . . . . . . .
we were so happy to have found this screen pet door ! we have two smaller sized dogs and a rather large cat . they all use the door and i no longer feel like the doorman ! i gave this stars because of how much we appreciate the convenience and it is the perfect size . one issue we had was the plastic sides to the door that attach to the screen kept popping apart . we solved this problem with a tiny bit of super glue . now it stays together and my pets go in and out as they please . we live in hawaii where the weather is great but can t leave the doors wide open due to bugs . so this really has been a great find ! !we were looking at the glass door inserts but not only do they not allow your sliding door to lock but they are hundreds of dollars . since our only goal was a way to let our cats in and keep the flies out during the day we were leaving our screen door open for them this seemed like a perfect alternative .it was easy to install i do suggest leaving a little more screen then they suggest when you are doing the cutout and works great for letting them in and out .a couple of items about it to help you make your decision if you live where there are alot of mosquitoes or gnats they will be able to fit btwn the cracks in the unit . you will have to close the glass door to keep them out . works great for areas like ours in ca where we just have to worry about flys and wasps .i recommend installing it in the middle of the door . when i lock the cat door they paw at it if they want to go out and it can get rough on the screen . we installed it in the middle of the door and so we can just close the glass door halfway to keep them from pawing at it .this mat rates five stars because it helps me maintain a little better control over two uber smart pets . i own four of these mats in total in three of the different sizes . i consider it a training aid and a tool that gives me a few extra seconds to help my pet when it needs a reminder of what the rules are and sometimes a few seconds is all you really need .first i am new to being a cat mom and the lengths that a young cat will go to in testing and re testing its boundaries will probably never cease to amaze me . at weeks it was the war of chewing cords i used the scatmat in a hallway to keep him on one end of the home while i kitten proofed all the cords on the other end then switched . at weeks he became nimble enough to jump up on the kitchen counters in one leap . butt surfing on my formica and eating out of the sink are two things i d rather he not have as habits . also if he could reach the counter that meant the stove could be next ! this counter size scatmat was ordered the next day as well as a special cover for the stove .the cat btw has since decided that the scatmat will not have the last word on where he should be allowed to roam the little guy spends a decent amount of time every day sitting near the patio door in front of the mat walking around the mat crouching ever so near the mat and appears to be intensely engrossed in figuring out how to outsmart the mat ! so far the mat is winning but with this amount of intense daily contemplation i wouldn t bet against the cat .my dog a lb doxie poodle mix has always been well behaved and i have no need for the scatmat as far as he is concerned . i did have to place a mat in front of a patio door to keep the kitten inside the house though and the dog quickly and easily figured out that he needs to approach it from the side and just leap over the corner . if you are buying this to keep a small dog contained i should mention that i did not work long and hard on training my dog to outsmart the mat i just put on his leash and said let s go as i always do when it s potty time and he navigated right around it and followed me out the door . i don t know for certain if he has ever activated the mat since he walks very quickly and the mat needs a second or two with two contact points to trigger the response . he does seem to know there s something to be a little wary of with the scatmat he avoids it so it s possible his curiosity got the best of him when i wasn t looking . point being it is very easy for my little guy to get around or over the mat .in the end this mat helps me to keep the kitten off surfaces in the kitchen and helps keeps him indoors where he should be . the dog pays no attention to it which is fine with me .
these are really nice quality top loading sheet protectors . i use sheet protectors to keep my knitting patterns in . this not only protects my knitting patterns but it also allows me to use a dry erase marker on the sheet protector to mark my place on the pattern . they work great for this . where some sheet protectors come apart at the seams sometimes when trying to insert sheets into them i haven t had this happen with these and i don t expect it to .surprised at how durable these are and how many sheets they hold . they may be just folders but these don t tear at the pocket when you carry a lot of papers .i use these notebooks for everything notes recipes memos . the college rule is just right . the pages are perforated but they don t come apart unless you tear them . the spiral binding also holds unless you tear a page out . the spirals don t come undone . the vinyl cover is durable and protective and the pockets are perfect for letter sized sheets . the price is good here . unfortunately you can t choose your color . i got dark pink which was fine . these are good if you are hard on your notebooks or if you plan to keep them for a long time . or just for you know regular notebook use .
i don t like that i have to continually tighten the knob at the back of the stand to keep the neck rest from tilting or moving and eventually falling down . the solution ? tighten the crap out of it with a wrench until you get it very snug and it won t budge .this pedal has a solid feel under my foot and gives me the push back i expect when playing live gigs . always welcomed is the fact is stays in place where i put it on both wood or carpeted surfaces .totally perfect for holding my guitar ! super sturdy easy to put in take out ! wide enough stance that you don t have to worry about it falling over on carpet !
if you are going to breast feed for a long time then i believe this is the best pump to buy . it is a little high in price but it is very gentle and easy to wash . dishwasher compatible . i have heard my other friends complain about their pumps being rough but this one is not . you have the ability to control how hard it sucks and how fast it sucks . i would recommended this to anyone who is going to pump long term . if you are only going to breast feed for a short period of time you may want to get a different one just because of the price unless that is not an issue . great pump !i measured ounces in a measuring cup then poured it in the liner and it was a little below the ounces mark on the liner . i tried it again with a different measuring cup and received the same result . you can not put the liner in the bottle first to fill it up because the measurements on the bottle do not match up with the measurements on the liners my husband always has a hard time filling up the liners because it is hard to hold it and add water since they expand . also the numbers on the liner are very hard to read .i started the first month of motherhood washing and sterilizing bottles multiple times a day . then i came upon these playtex nursers with disposable liners and now i only use a regular bottle if i have to . valuable time has been saved now that i m using these things instead !the only caution i have for others out there is to be very aware of the measurements . because the liners can accommodate oz of fluid don t trust the measurements on this . i noticed the difference when i poured oz of pre measured milk that had been stored in a milk storage bag and when it was in the playtex bottle the bottle indicated only oz of fluid .aside from needing to be more conscious of the measurements this bottle liner system has been a life changing discovery for my household .
this is a great product for the screen door it works well and fairly easy to install . this is a nice option to not cutting a hole in the wall or using a fake glass slider portion etc .fit my gallon long wide high just right . the two glass pieces came already inserted into the plastic piece that allows the glass to be lifted for feeding . the other extra plastic piece goes onto the rear glass piece in case you have filters in the back and need to cut slots out for them . however i don t use that plastic piece and have a inch and a half space that fits well for my filter and heater . it also comes with an attachable handle that makes it easier to lift the glass .i orderd this for my g tall . the picture is deceiving . there is a front piece of glass and a back piece of glass and then a small piece of plastic . if you have a hob filter or anything somewhat big you will not be able to use this canopy . junk .
it fits fine on my toyota tacoma access cab . i bought this and the stabilizer bar to keep my cooler s from trashing my truck bed .so ez even a cavemen can use it !ok he might have a few cuts while trying ! !i haven t put this cover through difficult duty and probably won t . . .it will stay in the carport most of the time . however construction is good the small vents on either side are pretty nice .regarding fitment the xl fits a bmw f st with stock rear luggage rack perfectly . this bike is about long maybe a few inches longer with the rack . . . .fits my chevy gmc x steering wheel perfect . stretch it over the wheel and wrap the vinyl string around it nice and tight . the vinyl will break so just stretch it a little .
i use this as a battery back up in my g tropical to provide air and water movement in a power outage . it s been tested and works great so far . when the power goes out this product starts up right away . don t expect it to make the same amount of bubbles that your whisper pump does but it comes close . great for a back up .i got this to test my ph while setting up a freshwater tank . where i live the water is quite hard so i knew some adjustments would be needed . this is a very simple to use kit and the laminated card that tells you the explanation of the test result colors is great . however because it only goes up to . i had to do a lot of guesswork to get my tank down to those levels . the color stays the same until the ph falls down to the levels this kit is designed for not a design flaw at all but it isn t the most effective kit when you live in a hard water area . i suspect the same would be the case if you live somewhere with very soft water too .this does exactly what it says it will do . we used to have algae scum up on the surface and tried all kinds of things to fix it . not to mention our all levels were in spec .once we put this on . . .all our surface scum . . . .and anything else on the surface was sucked into the filter . we had it set to a really high skim rate and left it for a couple days before setting it to a lower maintenance rate .there is a center adjustment piece that adjusts how much water on the surface goes down that throat so you can adjust from almost none possibly none to a whole lot . to maintain water flow into the filter the remaining flow goes in at the bottom .the top section floats on the surface by capturing air when you pull it out of the water when you first set it up .as for noise . . .it does make some but not really that bad . we have ours set to a really low skim rate and can hear it if we are close to the tank and listen for it .i removed one star for a couple of reasons . . . .mostly minor but needs to be considered when operating it .first as this is a surface skimmer . . . .floating food will get sucked in . adjusting the rate of flow will help but this will happen .second the adjustment knob in the center may be too long . our setup has covers flush with the top of the tank so this unit has to be set fairly low in the tank . it can still be adjusted but then the floating tube justs fits in the lower section to work properly .
the picture shows a box however my pads came in a plastic wrap . i prefer the box since it can double as storage and dispenser .the title says it all . what a mess ! black hands just unpacking the box . marineland could use a plastic bag inside the box .these are just the right size and are clean when they arrive in the package unlike some that will sometimes have charcoal loose in the package .
the listing for this item can be confusing if you are not sure what stereo xlr is . stereo xlr is meant to be similar to your stereo headphones where left and right are separate unbalanced wires . this cable is configured to be a stereo unbalanced xlr to a stereo unbalanced trs cable . this item is not a mono balanced xlr to a stereo unbalanced mic cable .a little bit a soldering can fix this connector by moving the red wire from ping to pin with the white wire . pin then ties to pin with the ground wire .the black mike stand blends in to the background better than silver . it fits standard microphone mounts and has a wire clip to keep the wire from being pulled away from the base .this switch goes with the fender blues jr . iii series of tube amps . the connector is well hidden it is up underneath the main badge on the back of the amp and you have to reach up underneath to find it . these are single channel amps the foot switch activates the fat switch which gives a little extra boost to folks playing single coil pickups . for an lp or other double coil the switch is almost overkill . but this is the switch for that amp .
i bought this for my ford escort lx sedan so i could hear my sony stereo more . i followed the instructions and applied the product to my front doors . i have noticed a difference in the sound quality of my speakers . i can hear them more and there s less vibration on the doors . as far as road noise goes it helped just a little . this product isn t made to reduce the road noise just to help get rid of vibrations and make your stereo system louder and easier to hear on the road . the road noise level is still the same in my car .works great installed it on my motorcycle and also kept the high tone stock horn . with both horns the sound is very loud it will scare the crap out of any dummies that pull out in front of me now . db stock horn db stock horn fiammif you understand how decibel measurement works you will know that is a big increase in sound . w was more than i thought i needed but the product works . i have not needed anything in my work truck that this hasn t handled . it also has its own fuse and proper electrical safety features many inverters depend on the car for electrical safety but backups are better . it also has a lot of aluminum to displace heat and never gets hot which is not true of many others either .the way i installed it i ran a gauge wire straight from the battery to its own relay to its own fuse to this device . the relay takes the signal from the stereo . that way it won t drain the battery if something is left plugged in . many reviewers who were having problems probably had more issues with their cars than this device . if you pull it from the cig lighter it will not give w in most vehicles . the car will just shut it off to prevent overheating .the only issue is when the radio turns off and cuts off the relay this device makes an audible high pitch noise as the capacitors discharge . its annoying but exactly what should happen .
this is a solid versatile lock that will fit class ii class iii and class iv hitch receivers . mine came with two hardened steel chrome plated pins not a sleeve as was illustrated when i bought it . the smaller pin works with class ii and class iii hitch receivers . the larger pin works with class iv . i use this lock to secure my bike rack and it s tough enough that i wouldn t want to lose my keys . the keyhole is protected by a weather resistant rubber cover yet rotates for easy accessibility . this is a rugged versatile hitch lock offered at a good price .very well made unit fits my ford f and my ram grease the snot out of it inside and out and install . the cover is a bit cheap but seems to work well . double double check that you have the locking end on correctly just play with it before use and you will master it .i put these in my tj jeep wrangler . they fit perfect and work exactly as you d expect they should . i installed a set of w hids in them and the light output is tremendous .
the evans pedal patch will work for you great . . it will keep your mass drum head from gettingworn and nasty . . i cheap buy and it works excellent . .should you need to connect a condenser microphone to a phantom power box so that it will work with an ordinary amplifier or mixer without phantom supply this is a good length for the link .this is a simple footswitch that allows you to switch between two different presets on your fender mustang amp . it is very easy to use and works exactly as advertised . this switch is not bulletproof but works great for playing around with your small practice amp .
it works as advertised . replaced missing tremolo bar . i don t normally use one but if i ever wanted to sell the strat i would want to sell it complete .your option to change the wah configuration is amazing . only problem is the no dc adapter included needs buy separately .i expected cheap mic stands missing a few things that more expensive ones had . to be honest i m not missing anything . they have all the features and versatility you ll ever need . perfect for what i want to do . they even come with a clamp for your cable .
the swingline stapler is definitely a professional one .the sound it makes when it staples one can determine that sound is primarily heard in an office setting . it indicates that it is a good stapler .this is one serious pencil sharpener . i have absolutely no complaints about its functionality it sharpens fast and clean with a nice point . what may not be evident from the picture is that this pencil sharpener is large and it is heavy ! i couldn t believe how heavy the package was when it arrived . given the price and heft this is not a casual pencil sharpener for one s desk . this is for a high pencil usage situation a classroom an sat testing center or similar . if you re looking for a high usage high volume sharpener this would fit the bill .you can always count on swingline products and this package includes not just the stapler but also a large number of staples and a staple remover all at a reasonable price . the stapler is easy to load and has yet to jam or malfunction . reliability is a good thing .
the sponge material used on these is extremely inferior . it loses its shape and tight fit around the lift tube fairly rapidly from cleanings . the pore size isn t really ideal for most common applications it should be larger for better flow and less clogging . most don t need a fry safe size if you do it s something you use only as long as needed since a larger pore is more effective . the pedestal base is also a poor design sponge filters are generally better set directly on the bottom or even partly buried into the substrate . for the size there really isn t that much sponge for bio filtration an awful lot of it is the unnecessarily bulky plastic pedestal . the extra wide lift tube really isn t an asset sponge filters are much more effective with only a low to moderate flow rate a faster rate is counterproductive .edit i do see from the description the pro line now claims to use a reticulated sponge whether or not this is actually different or better than the ones i have owned i m not certain but it may address some of the earlier problems . i still feel it is a star product due to the other issues as well as the exorbitant price much better filters can be purchased at half or less .as previous reviewers have noted this is a perfect home for a single betta . it s my understanding that the filtration system for the marineland explorer a two gallon setup is too powerful for a betta but is fine it s the same unit in this tank no stressful riding the rapids just a pristine environment populated with beneficial bacteria that requires only a weekly partial water change and a monthly cartridge replacement rather than the frequent complete changes necessitated by the lack of a filter just to play it safe though i cover the intake tube with coarse nylon mesh to ensure that long fins don t accidentally get sucked in and torn .this little tank sat empty for several years it was purchased with a betta in mind but i realized that between seasons heating in my apartment is too iffy for an unheated tank . at that time the smallest available heaters were w models way too powerful for a three gallon tank . i recently discovered however that w models with reliable thermostats are now available so there s no reason why anyone shouldn t be able to house a betta safely and comfortably all year round . according to user reviews the two best models seem to be marineland s own stealth and the theo by hydor both are italian made are completely submersible and are available on amazon through third party sellers . i have one of each although i haven t needed them yet my suggestion would be to go with the stealth because it s made of plastic rather than glass and carries a lifetime guarantee the theo s is two years .this tank s only minus is the feeding area it s much too small and is nearly inaccessible even for someone like me who has very small hands and long slender fingers . i can only imagine what a pain it is for an adult whose hands are of more average size . it s also too easy to miss the water surface hitting instead the plastic brace that supports the filtration system lots of fun with bloodworms . it s a minor but very irritating design flaw .with a little gravel or so a cave i found a perfect one on aquabid a java fern which petco markets as tropica fern some java moss a thermometer and a free floating plant like gymnocoronis for lounging and algae control bettas love plants but please no plastic real or silk only you re good to go . forget gimmicky items including the ones manufactured by marineland such as bowls cubes hexes vases etc . bettas are shallow water fish best served with longer rather than deeper tanks with easy access to the surface . owners on the other hand dislike maintenance . the eclipse system three strikes a perfect balance between both parties . highly recommended for families except those whose members include obsessive troll like liver lipped ugly boys from finland .seems to work fine . i dont see any difference between these basking bulbs and regular watt household bulbs . . . .other than price of course !
provides a great finish with a nice glossy shine . does not leave streaks if used properly . this dries quickly every time .nice polish cleaner really works very well on the finishes i have cheap glossy chinese electrics and a matte finish acoustic . handy to have when your changing strings to clean that nasty fretboard wow do those things get dirty ! pleasant scent lemon oil and no residue . lasts a long time or squirts will do an entire guitar .i have a rose gold plated flute and wanted something to clean it that would not rub away the plating . this does the job perfectly . wipes off fingerprints smudges easily and with a little water cleans up lip stuff that gets stuck on my lip plate . is easy on the plating and very gentle . washes in the washing machine on handwash with no fabric softener and line dries . am very pleased .
it s as good as it looks . with that in mind it s perfect . it s not very sturdy if you re using it outdoors and it s windy but hey what do you expect from the way it looks ?i also own bose quiet comfort s and ae s and the grado s i s . these have become my favorites . the grado s have tight but somewhat weak bass and amazing but sometimes too shrill and airy mids and high s with a great soundstage both bose s have more pronounced bass than the grado s and good mids and highs but less airy and soundstage than the grado s and the audio technica s are in between with the best balance between accurate and pronounced but not excessively bass excellent mids and highs and very good soundstage . they have become my favorite phones . though the bass is pronounced it is with an accurate depth and a thud like a top line subwoofer when the bass drum hits . all in all quite a listening experience .this mic is excellent it s pretty much a straight up clone of an sm and for the money there are no mic s even close to this one . also the price at orange county speaker s website is and in store so i m not entirely sure why it s on amazon .
this unit folds up so small and flat that i love it for taking to presentations . the only caution i have is that it can get wobbly if you extend the legs to full length and the weight is not centered on the table . the legs store on the underside of the table and allows for a very compact table for a projector .easy to assemble no tools necessary except for a rubber mallet or hammer block of wood .very sturdy and the large wheels roll over door sills with little resistance . be sure to locate handle as pictured so the handle bracket is flush against the bottom of the top shelf .when installing wheels on the legs just invert the leg with the open end up position the wheel shaft in the leg tube and tap the leg on the floor a few times and wheels seat themselves .good product at a reasonable price quick amazon delivery .for the amount of time i spend at a desk and especially on my computer this footrest is a must have . i had a similar footrest in my corporate cubicle made of plastic and was happy to see this one made of steel . the construction is fantastic and it is simple to use and fully adjustable the tilt angle not the height .so why might you want a foot rest ? one it helps relieve pain in the back and can help you add to an ergonomic work safe set up that will be kind to your back and legs .this m footrest fits easily under desks and is a great addition to a healthy work station .
you should be aware that this printer has a serious ink low behavior . when any ink cartridge is getting low which still means a lot of ink left by the way it changes the fax reception model . instead of printing your faxes as they arrive it dumps them into memory . so even though yellow say is low it will not print your b w fax !it takes more than steps to print the fax and delete it menu scroll to memory item ok scroll to print ok document scroll to print all pages ok menu to go up scroll to delete ok to delete ok to delete menu to get out .worse after a couple of these the memory is mixed up . so when you want to send a fax it will say memory full even though the memory is empty . you then have to power cycle the printer hold down on off for second wait seconds power on wait for it to get ready another seconds .this means you either have to waste ink by throwing out cartridges before they are empty or you have to deal with this mess . canon says there is no workaround or fix for this .there are other problems with copying you should know before you buy i wish i did . you cannot use the auto document feeder sheet feeder when copying or scanning with any setting in auto exposure size etc . it does not make any of that clear so if you find it refuses the auto doc feeder reset everything to manual . black duplex printing uses color cartridges for one of the sides so uses the more expensive ink . that is it does not use the blank ink for both sides . . copying speeds are much slower than the blurb implies . if you make copies of one page it is as fast as they say . if you copy multiple pages each one takes much much longer does the scan and then does the print . also if any setting is in auto mode it does a two pass scan one to check the page and that takes a really long time .the other star reviews are right this printer has serious problems feeding paper . right out of the box it had trouble feeding paper and often displayed an out of paper error message when paper was in the tray . i was able to get the printer to work most of the time by reloading paper and or pressing ok multiple times but eventually the printer just refuses to feed paper from the letter size tray at all .i should note the paper is hp brand specifically for use with this printer .it s too bad because otherwise the printer is great fantastic print quality outstanding speed very easy setup for both windows and mac os x . but all of this matters little when it won t feed the paper . . .i wanted an all in one printer that had a sheet feeder for copying and faxing so that one need not manually feed it the document that is being copied or faxed . this printer does the job . the print quality is good and the printing is clear and crisp . the big color led on the front is very nice the built in instructions are nice and the quality of construction is excellent . i give this unit stars for the hardware and the prices on amazon are incredibly reasonable .the software i am not terribly happy with . the document scan copy fax software is strange it will not fax a document directly from the feed tray it wants you to first scan and copy the document to convert it into a file and then it easily will fax the file . so a fax becomes a two step process if you use the fax software rather than simply operate the printer using its integral buttons . strange .the unit installed ok although as with all hp printers the installation was somewhat quirky .for the money this unit is an incredible deal . if hp would just spend time getting its software right it would be an astonishing one .
this is a nice tuner that works great . nice part is it works on all stringed instrument . i will tell you my st one did go belly up but korg s awesome warranty covered it and my nd one works great . this is the tuner you want !this will work for just about everyone . . .but i prefer the walker williams brand . . .but these work fine easy to get strap locks on . . .will keep on the side for next guitar . . .you shouild be happy . enjoyworks great
nice strings . great sound .but rust easy .i had issues with the packaging . i used only string and the rest rusted in the paper jackets .you have to use all of the strings once opened .the cheapo musician s friend strings don t have these issues they are individually wrapped in plastic jackets and i don t have to use all of them at one go .i really like these strings because i have sweaty hands that tend to make the strings on my guitars corrode and rust very fast . i can play a guitar once and leave it there for weeks and the strings will be rusty and nasty when i return to it . i now rub down the strings thoroughly after each session playing them but this stil happens .then i happened across these elixir nanowebs . they are great . i no longer need to rub down my strings so thoroughly and they stay rust and gunk free for weeks of regular playing . however i did encounter one strange thing . while playing at a rehearsal my e string just popped and broke hurting my finger a bit . i was surprised because outwardly the string didn t look that bad .so that is the downside . with regular strings you can tell the string is near the end of its life b c it looks really bad . with these they may still look okay but be close to breaking . made me a little cautious .i still prefer these over other strings though .when i first installed these tuners my guitar would still go out of tune . mainly the second to the last string at the bottom and i later learned it was the wrong tuner and the string tree was too blame . sometimes i just don t pay attention to the obvious it turned out that there are short tuners and long ones . the long ones go on the top strings the short ones the bottom strings get that because i had them on incorrectly . and even worse i was using the string tree which is the part that holds down the bottom strings . the string tree google guitar string tree and you ll see one was actually making the strings not stay in tune with the locking tuners . i know silly but i was not paying attention .the reason you use the short tuners for the bottom is so the guitar will stay in tune ! the string trees get in the way and when you whammy the strings go out of tune . please take a note of that .overall a good product .

i read in the reviews that this would work on a graco pack n play but it doesn t fit on the side when the napper bassinet insert is in . once my daughter outgrows the bassinet it will be fine and we still use it right now but it will be more useful when it fits . it does fit onto the end but sits at angle due to the curve .this co sleeper is the best ! ! if you are thinking of getting anything other than this i .e . bassinet cradle don t ! ! ! get this . item give baby enough room to grow and move . waking up every three hours is hard enough ! with this co sleeper you can omit having to leave your cozy bed if breastfeeding . just reach over and pick up your baby and feed . it sits right by your bed and is safe ! !i bought this co sleeper to use when my baby outgrows the by your side sleeper which will be very soon . i was looking for something safe to put baby in to cosleep . the by your side sleeper was great to use for the newborn stage and to have baby safely right in bed with you . but i needed something bigger and the arm s reach co sleeper was the answer . i have it set up in co sleeper mode but i don t have it attached to the bed yet . i am currently using it as a changing table to get baby used to it so i can hopefully transition easier soon . the co sleeper is a nice size and i like that it has mesh all around the mattress area on the liner for breath ability . i also love that the co sleeper turns into a playard so i can use it after outgrows co sleeper . it s a great value . it s a in deal for me extra changing table so i don t have to go to baby s room for diaper changes in middle of night co sleeper soon and then playard .i did buy extra things for the co sleeper .i had to buy thearm s reach co sleeper bassinet leg extension kit naturalsince we have a high bed with a pillow top mattress . i haven t put them on since i haven t attached to bed yet .i boughtcontinental quilting quilted waterproof multi use padfor extra cushion on top of the mattress pad and it will also absorb any leaks that might happen . it fits the co sleeper great and covers the whole mattress pad .i also boughtamerican baby company organic interlock pack n play sheetsince i wanted a nicer softer sheet . it fits the co sleeper perfectly and its super soft .
the gate does not swing back does not close by itself and only the bottom lock worksgreat product does what it needs to do if only the product works better for small baseboards under in . the template does not do well on baseboards since it will be short a few cm depend on how thick the baseboard is in depth .overall pretty sturdyit does not brown the wipes it s very easy to maintain and clean it does the job jus fine !
this is a very versatile binder which can easily hold numerous paper documents . for those who still need to keep paper documents safe organized and clean this binder is perfect for that . make sure you get the correct size this is inch for the amount of documents you wish to store .these are great if you have a large quantity of papers . they are good for in boxes or outboxes and can accommodate large envelopes or large stacks of papers where others won t .on paper this copy holder is a great idea and with the m brand you know it is a quality product . this copy holder helps you keep a book in a slanted upright position so that you can refer to it easily . thanks to the extra heavy base it can really be any book including a dictionary . the elastic band keeps the book open and can serve as a line guide . so what s not to like ?it turns out that in everyday use i start to grow tired of it . first it is the size . inch is really big which is great if you need to hold a book open or have two sheets of letter sized paper side by side . but when the holder is empty it s really quite noticeable if left in front of the monitor . fine i will remove it when empty . but the base is heavy and the holder is not easily collapsible . both of these are in fact pros in my mind . there are a cons . the elastic band that holds the book open is not easily adjustable if you only want to use one hand . it also seems that this elastic band is the weakest component and will surely break the earliest . but it s hard to tell how long it will hold .overall i would say that this is great if you need an industrial grade copy holder on a regular basis with regular being the keyword here .
this is what these things should cost and this is how they should work . i will be trying this out in a chain of effects as the single power supply so i will report back if it cannot do that . works as expected for to pedal power . enough said .i didn t do the sound quality test but i have another one of these and it works just fine . i just tested if all the plugs work and they do . if i ll get some sound problems i will write an update but i m confident that it s going to be ok .after receiving thedunlop dual design straplok systemalready installed on my gibson standard electric . lbs . and liking them i decided to try installing them on my gibson studio electric . lbs . . noproblem . just follow the instructions exactly and they will work perfectly .i had no problem either installing them nor using them since the installation . money well spent makingsure my stringed instrument does not accidentally fall to the ground . besides safety i also like being ableto swap out my straps on my guitars . it s a nice convenience . if you are so inclined you can use the samestrap for all your guitars .if you are not sure if they will work on your brand guitar seek out an online forum and either search thatforum for the answer or join and ask your questions . you ve got a pricy piece of wood there and will wantto take care of it properly .what i don t care for but feel okay with because they work so well is how big they seem to be . theydon t get in the way when being used but look almost out of place . that is why i chose black for mysecond set . helps keep the product s profile down a bit . other than that the product works asadvertised . . . .note as of june i have installed two other sets and all are still working as expected . do rememberto check and make sure your hardware is secure . after repeated use the screws can come loose and therewill be trouble if this happens . do not use any glue in case you need to swap out the straploks in thefuture .
the rd generation powerprobe includes a number of changes for additional flexibility . in short it is a vehicle powered dvm with both a foot cable and an additional foot extension giving you a foot working range around either the battery terminals or cigarette lighter outlet both clips and a plug are included in the kit .with the series units they use a hard gold plated banana jack to hold the removable probe or cables to extend your reach . if you purchase the accessory kit it includes piercing probes that self center on a conductor pierce the insulation and attach to the jack allowing you to tap a wire at any point to locate intermittant problems .while the dvm is backlit all the time it also has bright white leds facing forward to aid in finding and probing terminals in dark places . the actual probe is hardgold plated with a sharp tip and removable at the banana jack . another identical probe is included with a screw in female banana jack in the accessories kit to retrofit the powerprobe i and ii units to accept external cables and probes .if you need to excite a circuit with a connection to battery ground or to battery positive the switch allows a momentary connection to bridge the probe tip to either voltage which is useful in testing relay driven circuits indicator lights and other small current loads . the prope voltage is always displayed during testing on the meter . the voltage ground switch is circuit breaker protected in case you accidentally drive volts into a chassis ground . additionally since the switch takes abuse it is easily replaced if it fails with just a screwdriver .combined with the testlead set the powerprobe greatly simplifies testing of vehicular wire and big rigs up to a single trailer . the dvm has selectable modes of operation designed for different problems . reading the manual is important to get the full value from this meter .although the price is a little high the design and construction quality are excellent . enough wire is provided to check running lights on trailers or to look for blown fuses . all of the wiring is exceptionally flexible and heavily insulated with top quality connectors . both the tester and accessories come in hard plastic cases that can be stowed in a service box .not mentioned in specifications is that although the probe runs from vdc the meter can be used to measure voltages up to vdc .heavy rubber good gauge coated snap connectors comes with variety of components necessary to test different configurations of sparkplug on vehicles equipment .has extended accessory to test recessed plugs such as those on a ford triton engine coil on plug setup .this test set will indicate yes no as to fire not a measurement of current .in sum if i m experiencing a miss at idle or under load and static ohm s are good and this tester indicates all plugs receiving fire there is high probability a weak coil exists . i then pull reinsert plug wires one at a time while engine is running stumbling to pinpoint faulty plug wire coil o skool way .kylethe horns were easy to install . they draw about the same amount of current as my stock horns in the . a to a range for each piaa horn so i was able to use the stock wiring relay and fuse instead of having to wire a separate connection to the battery positive . i used installation type b two horns each with a single wire . the stock horn positive connections plugged directly into the positive quick connect of the piaa horns . i didn t have to cut off the stock connectors and crimp on new connectors . the stock horns use a single connection so i ran a separate ground wire from each piaa horn to a ground point near the hood latch .i made an inverted t bracket to hang the two horns off of the location for one of the stock horns . the piaa horns are a bit larger than a typical stock beep beep style japanese horn so you do have to plan ahead to make sure that you have enough room for the horns and whatever mounting bracket you may use . i angled my piaa horns slightly outward instead of hanging straight down to clear an engine brace below the horns .the horns have a nice euro sound and are suitably loud .
arb base plate nice thick plastic works great . essential part of your kit if you carry a hi lift on your truck .i purchased this to secure my motorcycle . i use it on my fxe harley s front rotor . it works well and secures the front with the lock and visible indication to hopefully make the thief move on to another bike . the only problem i had with it was i wanted to put it on my rear wheel because that makes it much harder for a thief to take the bike . my rotor s holes are too small for the pin to fit and the throat barely fit due to my rotor s thickness . it does however fit well on my front rotor .bottom line this is a good low cost solution to add as one additional layer of theft protection for your motorcycle .well built with a weatherproof cover comes with two keys and will protect your hitch or what ever you need to protect .
the behringer usb premium input mixer is just what the doctor ordered . nice unit and works perfectly for vocals guitar bass guitar and keyboards . don t lock yourself down with a bad usb cablethe listing for this item can be confusing if you are not sure what stereo xlr is . stereo xlr is meant to be similar to your stereo headphones where left and right are separate unbalanced wires . this cable is configured to be a stereo unbalanced xlr to a stereo unbalanced trs cable . this item is not a mono balanced xlr to a stereo unbalanced mic cable .a little bit a soldering can fix this connector by moving the red wire from ping to pin with the white wire . pin then ties to pin with the ground wire .very simple device to connect a quality dynamic microphone or instrument using a direct box to the usb input of a computer . i plugged in my mic and plugged the cable into my pc . win automatically searched for and found the drivers in about three minutes . i then recorded some vocals using audacity a free open source download . recording was whisper quiet with no background hiss or noise at all . recording level was great not sure why some reviewers said it was too low . note that this will not provide phantom power nor does the item description imply that it will . usb only provides vdc and phantom power usually requires vdc . unless there is some kind of power converter which would be much too large to fit in this compact package it is impossible for this or any similar sized cable to provide the higher voltage that phantom power requires . use this with a dynamic mic or direct box and if you use it correctly you will be very happy !
these insertable tab dividers match up easily against the standard dividers that students have been using forever . the big difference is that standard dividers usually come in a five or six pack whereas these come in an pack . for students this allows a tab for every class as well as a couple of extra sections for students to personalize to their own organizational style .like other standard dividers the paper used to make these is slightly denser than regular notebook paper but still rather flimsy . there is a reinforcement strip at the hole punched edge but it is still rather flimsy . these dividers would work fine for a semester s use but i wouldn t expect them to hold up under heavy usage for a full year .this college rules graph paper is filler paper meaning it can be inserted into a three ring binder . each sheet has a reinforced strip on it to prevent it ripping out of the binder . the thickness of the paper is adequate and as i expected . the lines on the paper are perfectly consistent throughout the package and they are dark enough . this graph paper is double sided and has different size graph lines on the front and back . on the front one square inch of paper contains squares and on the back one square inch of paper contains squares on it . overall the price is a little high for only sheets but you get both sides of the paper so it s like getting sheets of cheaper single side graph paper . this is very good paper and we like it a lot .this is an excellent basic binder . it s a usable medium size with slightly stiff round rings and a handy fold out front cover . the cover is an inoffensive shade of white . a sheet of thin clear plastic is wrapped all the way around the outside providing slots to slip in a full sheet of title cover paper at both front and back plus a strip of paper to label the spine . likewise a strip of the same plastic extends all the way around the inside to about a third of the height of the binder . this provides front and back slots to slip in a sheet or two of paper that you haven t gotten around to punching . i buy such binders six or so at a time .
i couldn t tell you if this is the reason my son s head is round in the back smile . but i can certainly say that this is excellent for keeping the baby s head in a straight and comfortable position specially when they are newborns and they spend a lot of time in their carrier bouncy chairs or swings . this is not intended for use while sleeping in their crib .i would not recommend using this product in lieu of the standard car seat headrest while transporting the baby in a car . after market headrests that have not been crashed tested could cause serious injury in the event of a collision .my baby s head falls to the side in this swing ! it does not recline enough . this is for babies who have full head support and can sit up on their own . not not for newborns ! ! ! needs to be re called . if you are going to use this swing make sure you are within eye sight of your baby don t take any chances and leave baby for any length of time because his her head can get caught in the side even with the net there .i purchased my brest friend for my daughter in law when she had her first child and it was fine . however since this has the option of sitting a baby in it and the baby is secure made this a great option for both nursing and having the baby lie on the bed safely while in a semi upright position .
i was so excited to get this for my yo and it is a great toy . . . my yo yo love it . but it has an issue with batteries ! when it arrived with included batteries in a try me box the batteries were dead . it s not being played with at a rate that warrants having to change the batteries once or twice a week . when it begins getting low on power the music sounds warped like an old warped record which is dreadful ! perhaps we got a defective one . i don t know . i hope this isn t happening to others .i have used many highchair booster seats and i have to say that this is one of the best . good quality product for your money . i love that it can fold down and travel . i will be taking it to pennsylvania with me from alaska in a few months in one of our suitcases . i will let you know how it does . i have taken it on road trips and it is so nice . you cant go wrong with this seat .i really like how this product hid the plugs and kept my son from unplugging plugging the electronics . it is very hard however for me to open it but i guess that s the point .
excellent product . works very well non toxic and does exactly what it claims to do . granted vinegar in boiling water would do the same but this doesn t leave a lingering smell like vinegar .fantastic product but it is somewhat leaky at the t connector in the sink . it does what it claims and does it well . if it was not somewhat leaky it would have been perfect .this stuff does its job and can be used to dechlorinate water and also as an emergency to detoxify nitrates etc .
had my yr old car painted and the body shop said no waxing for days to let the paint out gas . i live in fl with bug season and water spots from washing and general dirt abound . called meguries and this stuff is body shop safe . which means it will let the new paint out gas . i have been using it with excellent results between washes . once the days are up i will use a permeate wax .for really tough bug stains i use dp detailers road kill bug remover and then the final inspection to bring the shine back . on very light bug splats the final inspection works fine .this stuff works great ! i was skeptical . it seamed expensive but this bottle will last you years .it really works . wipe one towel off . no streaks no dirt . amazing . this way you can wash your car in your garage in the winter or to keep out of direct sunlight in the summer .i use this product after i dust off my car i do it every night because i love the paint job on my car it cleans bird droppings and bugs from the hood without leaving any streaks .along a soft microfiber cloth this spray will keep your car looking clean
this machine never worked the way it was advertised to . it cannot handle urine the urine clumps and scooper gets caught on it . this stresses the motor out to were it resets itself thus not scooping anything . or if it does break through it the clump crumbles to small enough pieces where it slips through the scooper and quickly starts to stink . i tried five different types of litter nothing improved the machines performance . i ended up keeping a hand scooper and plastic bags available as i had to scoop and clean it myself . the plastic mounts on the scooper ended up snapping of after two months of use . the box is just messy and useless and hard to wash as you have to disassemble it . you might as well buy litter tray for it will function times better . i use a plastic concrete mixing tray you can get at home depot for . it looks just like a litter tray except it is about x . if you got the room this is the way to go .if you decide to buy this auto box save the receipt . you will need itif you want a good auto box get the one that uses the disposable trays with the blue crystals . that is a good auto box .this does exactly as advertized . the little ledge on the top makes it easy to slip under your litter box and it s easy to lift up and shake out over a trash can .i find that the littermaid works very well for what it is designed to do . the only truly unpleasant task is changing these waste receptacles . the difficulty i seem to experience is inserting a new receptacle . it is difficult to get the thin retaining lip on the tray itself securely under the plastic flanges attached to the litter box which retain the tray . once it is in place it works like a champ but in a future redesign i hope that the good folks that design this fine line of electric self cleaning cat boxes will develop a more secure retaining method that facilitates easier receptacle changeout .
got this stake for houdini my escape artist dog . the install took about minutes . hammering the top as the instructions stated chipped the paint off so i can t give it stars . the hard part is getting that auger near the bottom to start digging into the ground . turning it with my bare hands didn t go too well so i found a long metal pipe to help me turn it into the ground as i pushed down . a broom handle would probably work the same way . there is no way you d get this all the way into the ground with just your hands ! i don t see how this thing would ever come out once it s installed properly so if you ve had a problem with the cheaper ones coming out this is the one for you !oh the black tip you see in the pictures comes off to reveal a sharp edge .love this thing it floats to the top as opposed to sinking where you d have to reach in the tank to retrieve it if it somehow gets loose from the glass the other half of the cleaner . this one has a very powerful magnet though so i haven t had it slip away yet . it s inches long so this is perfect for my gallon .this thing is always falling down to the bottom of the tank and i have to reach in and get it . i ve had others that you could retrieve with the magnet but not this one . i dont like it
i am pleased with this model of fax machine . it offers just enough options that i can function taking care of business at home without having to travel all over to get paperwork shipped . not so complicated that you have to go to college to learn how to use .with the new services from the post office that save you money on presized boxes these are the perfect label to print on your computer then adhere to the box .the usps ups will send you a pdf of the final shipping label and ask you to print the pdf onto paper fold it in half and put it in a pouch or onto a label . these are the perfect labels . you get on each page so you can rotate it and use it again .prior to the usps on line printing capability we had to pay a rd party e .g . stamps dot com to print mailing labels for us . now with the on line account from the post office you can do it from home and save money over the counter rates . in addition you don t have to wait in line at the counter just walk up and hand the box to someone because your postage was applied before you went to the post office from your credit card most likely with the usps you can hand the package to your mail carrier but keep in mind he she may have parked several blocks away so it s going to get some beating as they walk the remainder of their route to their truck . i had one carrier tell me to leave my package on the hood of his vehicle and he d put it inside when he got back not too comforting but it worked .i ve been using these for all my shipments and never had a failure . in fact the pre announcement of the tracking id helps to speed things through usually trimming a day off the transit time . it s a small price to pay for the savings and convenience !i tend to trust the buyers at costco on products like this . their judgments rarely fail and they ve certainly put good value for money into their warehouse store with the uniden cordless phone . you can of course buy this phone at lots of other places too but the costo endorsement means something .we live in an s era house with two stories an office basement . the base station on the uniden stays on the first floor where heavy foot traffic makes it an easy visit to check on messages . one additional handset stays upstairs and the other in my basement office .each handset fits nicely into a vertical position on its own stand . reholstering the handset doesn t require fidgeting or that you hit the bullseye . just drop it in roughly the right place and it settles into its stand . this makes a virtual no look hangup possible when i m working at my desk . it s not a big day but saves a few seconds per day and removes one slight irritation from life . i ll take that when i can get it .we ve had excellent voice quality and no problems with this phone . the expandable feature means you can add handsets as you need them but so far our two dogs and one cat have not demanded their own apparatus .if costco s buyers choose it you ll rarely go wrong . you can find a cheaper phone and answering system but i ve not seen better value .
i ordered the one in the red box but they sent me this instead . just added it to tank hopefully it does what i need .i prefer eating produce that is organic and from the usa so when i saw organic catnip i thought i d give it a try for our kitties . i placed my order on friday . i was so surprised on when i got an e mail thanking me for my order . i only ordered small item i love the fact that i got an e mail from the president of the company letting me know my order was appreciated . the order came promptly and in good condition . and the most important thing the kitties love it ! thank you .the reason i am only giving a one star to my review is that the picture was deceptive . the basking lamp shown was a watt and when i received my order i was shipped watt lamps . i could have probably bought the watt lamps locally at a price that would have been just as good as what i paid . i think this is deceptive advertising . the lamps themselves are fine although not what i thought i was ordering .
fit oerfecrly in my gallon tank water evap droped down a lot . clear so light really geta in and very sturdydoes the job nice size thermometer and stays where you put it in the tank does not break loose from the glass .i use this above a glass tank to help keep my leopard gecko warm . it works very well and doesn t have a light that goes on and off to stress the gecko .
it does know when your guitar is in tune ! does it for you so you don t have to do it by ear .this baby does what it says it does at a very reasonable price . one does have to find the cable loops that one needs to eliminate humming noise for one doesn t know which in or output is actually making the interference but once you ve established that it s all good baby ! ! !great for the price . it is a very accesible option and does what it has to do . must have for solos
i love this little guy i put it in the corner of my tank and check it often just to make sure all s good . i also have a seneye electronic monitor in the tank and it will light up but i still use this as a backup and double check option . works perfectly . it takes about minutes for a bump in ammonia to show up as a different color but then usually settles back down to yellow .i picked up an old gallon aquarium from a yard sale it had a old tetra whisper on it . as i got more into the hobby this filter seemed to be the most recommended filter . wanting to up date i picked up the aqua clear . i put it on the same day i dirted my tank and as anyone with a dirted tank knows the water is cloudy when you first fill it up or move plant around this filter quickly clears the water up plus is very quite . i can t think of any negatives if in run into problems i ll update this reviewit s doing something for sure the water in the aquarium is crystal clear the purigen is getting brown . i m going to purify it and use it again once it gets dirty enough .
the mixer is good for the price but i had to return my first one soon after opening it due to some loose parts moving around inside . the packing way below average . as a matter of fact it was the only outer box without any cushioning . after seeing those ups and fedex delivery videos i would not pack a ups or fedex shipping item in such a poor packing . however the great seller i am referring to amazon immediately responded and sent me a replacement along with a prepaid label to return the fist unit . second unit too had the similar packing but no damages . worked fine .the string winder with a string cutter and pin puller is an excellent design . it will be very useful when installing new guitar strings with all of the items needed for the job .my only issue is the shipping charges for such a small item . the shipping cost were almost as high as the cost of the item itself making the purchase of this item an unfavorable purchase price for a single item . if you need an additional item on an order from this seller you need to check the shipping cost or you will not be getting the good price advertised for the item and may consider purchasing it elsewhere .does what it is designed to do it holds about picks . small piece of adhesive tape on the back . the supplier refunded some of the postage . amazon promised to credit my account credit never appeared for the highly inflated shipping costs . a item cost . for shipping ! be careful and read everything before you click to submit the order .
wonderfull gate ! it swings in both directions . it is extra tall . you dont have to mount it on to your walls . it comes with two extensions and i have used it with both extensions on it and it dosent give at all . our house has odd openings and i can fit this anywhere . i still have a plastic gate in my kitchen and just came online to order a second one of these to replace that .good news for parents of curious toddlers . the way to open it is a button on the top of the gate since this is an extra tall gate you d have to be the parent of a future nba player to get to it . even if you have a super tall todler you have to push the button over and lift the swing gate to open it . . . it is very easy for most adults however visitors will have problems with it ! ! !also if you need extensions for a gate you need to check the price of extensions . . . i needed both extensions and by the time i added them onto other gates i would have paid . or more . that is the reason i chose this one .i have a snugride carseat . apparantly not all snugrides are considered equal when it comes to the base . i purchased this model thinking i would save money on my spare base . now i have to return it and wait for the more expensive one to come . how hard is it to include in the product information that it excludes or will only fit certain models ?i needed a few extra shields valves and membranes . this came as an all on one set . i love that it doesnt breakdown in pieces and it is simple to use . perfect .
this fits our crib mattress tightly and keeps our baby from sweating against the vinyl of the crib mattress . we didn t have a mattress pad with our son and he would wake up soaking wet from sweating against the vinyl of the crib mattress . the crib sheet alone wasn t enough to keep him from sweating . this pad is also not too bulky so it doesn t cause a safety concern . just make sure the pad fits tightly on your crib mattress for safety s sake . we have a sealy crown jewel mattress and it fits great on it .this review is for the universal bedside co sleeper which is exactly the same as the original except it s sized for beds that are inches tall the original is sized for beds that are inches tall and taller .after only a few weeks of using a traditional high sided cradle for our baby who gets up to nurse several times in a night we decided that we needed something to make moving the baby between her bed and ours easier . we chose the bedside co sleeper and we haven t been disappointed .the low side of the co sleeper is level with our mattress and the mattress of the co sleeper is about inches lower than that . this means that when my baby wakes in the middle of the night to nurse i only have to lift her four inches to get her into my bed . i don t even have to sit up to manage this . plus since there are no bars or slats between her bed and mine when she s fussy at night i can easily reach out a hand to soothe her or find the pacifier she s let slip from her mouth . the four outside pockets one on each short end and two on the long end are convenient for holding burp cloths extra diapers baby wipes etc everything i need for late night feeding and changing .some reviewers have complained that the mattress is too hard . actually i found that the mattress is padded but lumpy . this is because it s designed to fold up so the co sleeper can be portable and fit into a travel bag . i solved the problem by putting a quilted multi use pad on top of the mattress underneath the fitted sheet . the quilting helped smooth out the lumps and make the mattress more comfortable without making it so soft that i m worried about a smothering hazard . also the pad is good protection for the mattress in case of nighttime accidents since the mattress is made only of cloth with no plastic cover unlike typical cradle mattresses . be sure to buy at least one extra fitted sheet when you purchase the bed one is included with the bed itself since regular crib or cradle sheets won t fit .my only complaint so far is that the solid fabric sides of the co sleeper prevented me from hanging my baby s crib toys on the bed . otherwise i ve found this bed to be an absolute lifesaver and the only kind of infant bed i would recommend .this pad is great to place under your sheets in parent s bed where mom sleeps and nurses . just the right size to shield mattress from excess breastmilk !
works as described . solid little wires that allow you to be creative in how you hook up your guitar pedals . . .may work other applications that require the same type of plug .good deal on this package of patch cords . they work just as well as the more expensive ones i have used . i like the length too . it is long enough to make a loop in which make everything easier to work with .great for video photo work or even theater . it won t handle well at a large space . if you are a light fog this is the job for almost any situation .what i ll be using it fordj work to show laser beams and light beamsvideo work use it to make a hoax car crash or meteor crash site that s what you are seeing in movies photo work not so much for general photography because it can make people think you shot at too high of an iso .
i purchased this bottle warmer for my second baby because it was a life saver for my daughter . it stores bottles in the compartment and comes with a small ice pack . do not store milk with this ice pack for more than eight hours . the pack is fairly small and does not cool the milk for long . i use a freezer pack and store one bottle at a time . i would add a time chart just to know approximately how much time it takes to heat up a bottle .i love this pack n play ! the other ones that are rectangular and fancier did not work for us and they were twice the price . . . . it was the one with a changing table and bassinet . i finally relented one day and bought this one because it was bigger boxier and roomier . my son hates restraints and being boxed in but he is much more okay with this larger pack n play and is willing to stay in it for minutes at a time a record ! . and he is . now so it will definitely last longer than the rectangular ones you see everywhere . . . .if you re looking to this pack to replace the pack that is sold now without the storage discs don t buy them ! they do not include the plastic storage disc cover either and are only a dollar or so cheaper than the pack . i think amazon sells the discs separately but you should still buy the pack instead of the pack . definitely not worth it and once i opened them to see if they contained the disc i couldn t return them .
we love this bedding . great quality and washes very nicely . i also like that it is very easy to find coordinating jersey knit crib sheets . a yellow crib sheet with this set really looks nice bright . my husband and i could not be happier .i just love this whole color scheme . we painted our son s room blue and got every piece to this set . it is just such a nice change from the baby blue with pastel colored bedding sets . it is definitely a little boy s bedding set . some many things match it outside of this collection too because of the blue and red combination . the sheets wash well too which is a nice plus .my month old son has such a cute all star room . we have all the bedding the lamp wall boarder and diaperstaker . his walls are navy blue and the wall boarder is on the top and bottom of the walls . the bedding looks so precious on his natural wood crib . the only piece of the whole set that dissapointed me was the crib sheet it didnt fit too well so i just use it over his changing pad and use a different sports sheet instead . my son loves staring at his bumper and he will just look at it for hours sometimes seriously ! well we also have the aquarium bed attatchment which works well . i couldnt pick a better set for him and i like thats its not cars like his month old twin brothers were . i love this set and it washes very well doesnt rip or fade . a perfect set and just absoulutly adorable !
while i have heard that these devices can be great for recording concerts and have heard some great recordings to back that claim up my review will be focusing on my main use which is podcasting . after using the zoom h n for a few weeks i ve found it to be a very versatile tool that should be in any podcaster s arsenal of gear .i mainly use the h n to record my podcasts using a allen heath zed mixing board . i usually do a two person podcast where i am in one location and the other person is brought in via skype . using the aux sends of the board and the track mode of the h n i can record myself in one channel the other person in another channel and all of the sound effects and music supplied by my ipad into its own stereo channel . this makes editing a breeze as everything is on its own track .the sound quality of the h n is excellent and it is very easy to hook up external microphones to the unit . you can hook up either two xlr microphones or two jack sources or a combination to the bottom of the unit and there is one input on the back of the unit that will accept a stereo microphone or any line level stereo source . it s the combination of these that lets me record the podcast onto the separate tracks .the h n will also let you record using two attached microphones and the internal microphones at the same time as well which could be useful if you re looking to capture some background noise if you are recording something on location or say to mix the crowd reaction to a soundboard feed .overall this is a great device for podcasters both in the studio and out in the field letting you produce high quality recordings in both environments . five stars without a doubt .i love this amp . here are the reasons solidly made everything is high quality . best of all it comes with fender fuse software whereby you can hook it up to your pc using the usb cable included and control all of the amps features over and above the actual settings on the amp without even touching the knobs including special effects like various stomp box add ins effects like reverb distortion phaser factory presets on the dials etc and you can even select different amps on the pc screen visually . you can also go online through the app and download presets other people have created . if you want to play a pink floyd song you can download a david gilmour preset and there you go . you got your dark side of the moon and the wall preset ready to go . this is so cool and watts beats and works for me . i can record directly from the amp into my pc mixpad software program .usb condenser mics and more specifically this one are great for doing podcasts and for portability . the reason being is that they are condensers for one and the other is that this mic has a built in interface . an interface is a glorified sound card with both a microphone preamp and analogue to digital and digital to analogue ad da converters . of course most any standalone interface is going to give you way more desirable results than just plugging a microphone into the mic jack on your computer way way better . so this mxl studio usb even with the built in interface is going to give you quality far exceeding your computers potential . so instead of having to carry a separate interface around with you having this all in one mxl studio usb all you need is a laptop with a usb input and you .there are limitations though with a usb mic with the main one being that you can only record the microphone without being able to plug in any instruments . although you could record instruments using this microphone and that way be able to layer more tracks in your daw . recording multiple tracks at the same time is not possible with this mic unless you are recording the same thing in multiple tracks .the really good thing about this mic is that you are getting some pretty decent quality for the money . so for anything that you need to do using a microphone as your one and only sound device it is ideal quick easy and affordable .one of the problems with using it in pro tools or any daw is that you can only use one interface at a time . since the mic has a built in interface you can t use any other . even in garage band for mac although they have the ability to use more than one interface because you can toggle between the two but not be able to use two simultaneously . so in plain words if you are planning studio capabilities a usb mic is not what you need . i have a couple of mxl condenser mics that i bought for my studio . i have the mxl v m which was their early offering but is no longer made and i have found the mxl v to be comparable to that one . some other mxl s like the are muddy in the bottom end . when bottom fishing for a good decent condenser mic some of the cad offerings are also top sellers .when using the mxl usb in win no driver download is necessary . if your mic comes without the included cd you can download the free mxl studio control app which includes input controls for microphone gain and an adjustable high pass filter . it also has a nose gate with adjustable threshold . there are also output adjustments as well .one other thing that is unique about usb mics working with your pc is that they are dependent of course on your pc . so i had the hardest time trying to figure out what was wrong when i couldn t get the output from my pc or into the free reaper daw recording software free day trial also downloadable from mxl . so i finally gave up after trying various input options etc and discovered through the troubleshooter in windows accessible via control panel and then sound and then type troubleshooter into the search box in the upper right corner . the answer was that my mic input volume inside of windows was down to zero . i moved the slider up and bang it worked .so for sound quality you are getting decent quality for the price and it has a built in interface and even an output jack you can plug your headphones into it s a mini jack like you have on your computer . so with just your laptop and this mic you are set for pod casting or any other function that requires only one microphone and no other channels . this mic comes with a desktop stand which is an indication of its intended purpose as opposed to a studio vocal or instrument mic .
i am bewildered by all of the reviews claiming the toddler bundle me is too small for their children . maybe these people received the infant version instead of the toddler version ? i have a month old daughter that is at the higher end of the growth percentiles and she s got plenty of room in this thing . we received the infant bundle me as a shower gift so i was eager to jump to the toddler version . it s warm fits her jeep stroller perfectly and eliminates the need for many cumbersome layers . very satisfied .i purchased this crib after my son grew out of his graco travel lite crib at three months . my son is four months old now and fits in it perfectly and there is still a lot of room for him to grow . it is a nicely made crib and is worth the that it costs . it is so cute and i love the fact that they sell a bedding set for it . we bought the malawi set for it which looks adorable . i wish i would have gotten this crib from the begining .i bought this chair in january and have been using it everyday ever since . my daughter is months old now and the chair hasn t fallen apart or broken off . my husband and i love the fact that this comes with its own removable feeding tray . easy to wash . my older daughter who is years old now had the blue green one . she still could fit it at years old but gave it away to a relative who needed a few years ago . really love this seat . i am short on space so i needed something really compact and this chair fit the bill .
you can t just add tap water to the fish tank you have to dechlorinate it . this product does just that . it works instantly so it is very convenient . it comes in a nice little bottle with a built in dropper . this lets you easily measure out how much you need . you don t need a lot . i do wish that they had instructions for the amount of drops you need per gallon . it just says to use tsp per gallons which isn t appropriate if you are just doing a water change or if you have a smaller tank .i can t say how well this works but it has the good bacteria in it to maintain an established aquarium .based on the math of how much is required to treat the same volume of water prime is one of the best value for your buck !it works well for chlorine and chloramine so it does not matter which your water treatment facility uses . it also works well to neutralize the chlorine after you ve done a bleach solution cleaning of your tank !
why didn t i think of this ? is what it is and does what it says its does . from martin nuff said !i don t have any real praise or complaints about this . i does just what it should and for the price it s pretty good . like most pedals it can be used with a v plug in transformer but it s not included . yes it s made of plastic but you can t expect any more for .there too many required words to type for a product that doesn t need that much explanation . it mounts to any mic stand and is formable to any position you need . sturdy .
container is made in a pretty heavy duty plastic the hinge where the lid connects to the container is pretty weak but aside from that the rest is pretty well made . the lid has a strip of rubber foam along the outside edge where it comes into contact with the lid of the container which provides an airtight seal .generally speaking pretty easy to use and is as described .it s smaller than i thought it d be but quality is fine . the edges of the plastic are smooth and it does not have any icky plastic smell .the plastic is thick enough not to flex or twist and the shape of the end is good as it sits on the tailgate . very stable . . . . 
these fit both my medela spectra dew pumps . my medela is ancient at least a decade old but the newer pump parts still fit it so these go from the standard bottle size to fit the avent bottles .i have both the super wide nipple avent bottles as well as the classic size and these adapters fit fine .i also have the avent via storage system and the wider converter fits those just fine as well .i don t know what the other reviews mean about leaking . . . . i put the bottle caps on that come with the bottles tops that fit the storage containers on as soon as i m done pumping . if my milk is nearing the top of the bottle container while pumping i switch out bottles . but while pumping i ve experienced no leakage .i did not buy this but i have the medela pump in style . thanks to those who mentioned that the evenflo nipples would fit the bottles but it s the evenflo classic nipples that fit not the evenflo elite nipples . now i just need to find caps that would fit without having to buy this whole set .these only fit on the older style bottles as they lock in with the lid which on the wide mouth glass bottle is much bigger . the traditional bottles i imagine would be great but these are useless for me unfortunately .
need one say more ? and these can be locked in place using a small lock you put in the tightening head lock not included . once in place between the wheels on a tandem axle trailer there s no way the trailer will move . cool !i bought a pair of these for my grand cherokee . it took a grand total of minutes to install both of them and half of that was spent looking for a screwdriver .if you are at all nervous about trying this here is a overly detailed set of instructions . . open hood . prop it open with something wooden so it doesn t fall on you . . identify the strut on the right side of the hood . . identify the small metal clip at both ends of the strut . if in doubt look at the new ones . you are looking for a metal band about inch in width with two small slots . on the vehicle slide a small screwdriver blade into the clip s slots and twist the screwdriver to pry the clip upward . you can remove it or just loosen it enough that there is a good sized gap between the clip and the strut . . now pull the strut away from the hood body . you may need to slide a screwdriver behind the strut arm to get a little bit of leverage . it is easier to start with the end attached to the hood . . remove both ends of the strut from the vehicle . . attach the new strut . make sure the strut is aligned the same way as the old one with the cylinder at the top of the strut . refer to the opposite strut . just place the socket in the strut over the ball joint on the vehicle and give it a little tap or squeeze with your hand . it should snap right on . . repeat on the other strut .note if it seems like the strut is too big the hood is probably not open all the way . there is no way you are strong enough to compress the strut by hand .i d strongly recommend replacing them in pairs otherwise you will get a twisting motion on your hood . plus if one failed the other one is close behind .that s it you re done .this little gadget keeps my lift handle paired up nicely when mounted to my vehicle . it can get in the way when jacking but it is easily solved by just pulling it up onto the d hook on the top .
i am average height for a female but i have a short torso and need to sit very high in relation to my desk and computer monitor . therefore my feet dangle off the edge of my chair . this footrest is sturdy with a nice non slip surface . initially i thought this footrest wasn t tall enough for me but then i discovered that it was adjustable . problem solved . the surface is non slip and rubbery so even my bare feet are comfortable on it . the tilt is adjustable too which is good . it s not aesthetically appealing but it sits under your desk so who s going to see it ? it s a very nice product and i recommend it to anyone who is height challenged .i missed the part that said this pad is thick . that would be ok for a chair with adjustable height . unfortunately my chair does not adjust and the cushion does not compress much . so my feet do not touch the floor and i cannot get my knees under my desk . too bad because the cushion was comfortable .the dimensions of the m adjustable foot rest are x . the height adjusts from to . . the angle can be adjusted to degrees .i find the foot rest to be easy to use and very helpful . it comes completely assembled which is a plus . i work in a cubicle and the foot rest just fits in the space under my desk it is almost too large for the cubicle but i found that to be a plus since it prevents me from sitting too close to the computer and i m no longer able to slouch over while typing . the height is very easy to adjust by turning the screws on the inside be careful however as the edges of the foot rest are a bit sharp . it is also very easy to adjust the angle while you are sitting simply by putting pressure on the foot rest . most importantly i can feel the difference when i use the foot rest my back and my legs immediately feel better and i m not aching at the end of a long work day .the m adjustable foot rest make a big difference in how i work and feel . highly recommended .
i bought this when we moved to our new apartment because i didn t want to trip over a huge high chair . my daughter loves this seat and can t wait to sit in it for her meals . it comes with trays so when one snap out tray is being washed you can use the main tray for feeding . it also comes with a cover so that the trays don t get dusty or gross when not in use . the seat also has height settings so that you can adjust it to get baby closer to the table so s he can eat off the table . the seat back also folds for compact storage . it is also very lightweight and you can move it while holding baby too . this chair is very easy to attach to the chair and when both straps are tightened the seat stays very snug . there is no need for non slip rubber feet with how tight the straps stay . this chair is a best bet for small spaces or when baby gets too big for a high chair .my only problem with this booster seat is that it will not work beyond the point when the trays are removed and it becomes just a booster seat . my table top is at the standard height but the skirt of the table goes down too far to allow the seat to go under the skirt area . the booster does strip snugly to both dining room and kitchen chairs so there is no safety issues . the top sections of the tray are no longer used as a child can take them off too easily so i just utilize the bottom tray . it is a very economical way to have a high chair equivalency that works well and i would recommend this item for that purpose . it will also work well with a table that does not have a skirt to block it from scooting up to your table .love this thing . relatively cheap comes in various colors has an adjustment knob to fit various toilet sizes the hooks allows you to hang it added a tacky hook to bathroom wall and best of all it doesn t have the creavises other seats have let me explain . had another potty seat that was cushioned not sure why a kid needs a cushioned seat it is not like they will be sitting reading the newspaper for ten minutes at a time anyway it didn t take long for the vinyl cushion to get pee and other gunk stuck between the cushion and the plastic rim and then you have to look at it each time to put it on the toilet . this is a better option .
it has enhanced the night driving experience . i replaced the odyssey with this new set of bulbs . it is bright and legal . i tried the silver star but it wasn t brighter so i returned it . definitely buy it here on amazon . autozone is selling at retail which is . . for the price there you can buy sets here with change left over .i also got the for the high beam for my honda civic hybrid . but i used installed hid kit for my civic instead and not use the . but i actually think for budget minded people this set of ultra looks better than the xentec hid i got . for you can t go wrong with this . buy it and you ll be glad you did .bought this charger to replace the rediculous charger that comes with power wheel cars and trucks . had to do some minor wiring connector swaps but this charger is soooo much faster and actually let s me know when the battery is done ! terrific charger i would buy another ! ! ! can t beat the price and functionality . . . . . .i purchased these to replace my taylor wirestaylor cable red custom mm spiro pro ignition wire setbecause they were over years old and i wanted to give ac delco a try . i coupled these with the ac delco plugsacdelco professional iridium spark plug pack of and my truck runs like it did when it was brand new over years ago ! ! ! even though i have done a lot to the truck as far as engine upgrades these plugs and wires complimented all my upgraded components . thanks again amazon for selling the parts i need to keep my truck running like new .
i started with the smaller chuckit and my dog fell in love with that toy ! we took it to the dog park and another dog ran up to us so excited b c he loves playing fetch too and recognized the toy . we have a very large yard and the small one let us throw it about of the way . i wanted to run my lab puppy even more so i bought this one and it is probably because i started with the smaller one but i feel like it is awkward to use the bigger one and i can still only throw it of the way down our yard . it flies a lot higher and gives my dog more time to run down to where it will land before it bounces but i prefer the small version of this toy . but it works as intended and my dog doesn t care which one i use she loves the game .i grew up with four large dogs and my parents gave them nyla bones all the time . they d sit on the living room floor and chew for hours . i now have two dogs a gsd and an acd red heeler and this is their go to toy for when they want to chew . as with any toy you should always supervise your dogs but i ve never had a problem with any pieces tearing off or breaking . we typically throw them away when they start getting smaller and ratty just in case but that takes a long long time to get to that point . i ve seen one single nyla bone last for more than a year . i love these things .it s hard for me to tire my dogs out but this certainly helps ! paired with the whistle balls it keeps them busy for a loooooong time . i have a big yard so i need one of these to throw the ball all the way across it . i ve also taken it to my local dog park where i can get some serious distance .
i really like writing with pilot razor point pens . they write smoothly never get stuck like a ball point can and have a really bold vibrant ink color . because they are more of a marker point pen they are probably not ideal for writing on glossy surfaces as the ink can easily smear in this case . otherwise the pen is versatile durable and useful .i really like this pen . it has a soft cushion and the ink glides smoothly . it also has an ink indicator to let you know how much ink is left since the pen is transparent .while i like the way these pens write i don t like how long the ink takes to dry and how freely the ink flows .
we were looking at the glass door inserts but not only do they not allow your sliding door to lock but they are hundreds of dollars . since our only goal was a way to let our cats in and keep the flies out during the day we were leaving our screen door open for them this seemed like a perfect alternative .it was easy to install i do suggest leaving a little more screen then they suggest when you are doing the cutout and works great for letting them in and out .a couple of items about it to help you make your decision if you live where there are alot of mosquitoes or gnats they will be able to fit btwn the cracks in the unit . you will have to close the glass door to keep them out . works great for areas like ours in ca where we just have to worry about flys and wasps .i recommend installing it in the middle of the door . when i lock the cat door they paw at it if they want to go out and it can get rough on the screen . we installed it in the middle of the door and so we can just close the glass door halfway to keep them from pawing at it .i was worried my dogs would get confused as to which doggie door to use . i have a patio door doggie door and when i closed my screen door my dogs could not get in or out . now with this in my screen door i can close the screen and my dogs can still get in or out . great idea and works well with the patio doggie doors . they are so smart they know which to use and when .i love the flight cage the problem is that the parts were so badly protected during shipping . i believe it would be the box the manufacturer packed the product in . there was virtually no protection around any of the pieces in the box . bars were bent panels were bent and a food dish was broken . because the panels were bent it took forever to put the cage together because when you were trying to secure the panels they kept popping out of place . if you put the poor packaging to the side and look at the cage itself it s just an ok buy . the birds love it we have finches and they are flying all over the place . the perches they provide are good . at first i thought they might be too large for the finches but they are using them very easily . a real negitve are the doors . it sounds great when you hear they will shut automatically because they use springs in the doors the problem is if the springs fail the door isnt going to stay shut at all . these doors are located on the two ends of the cage both in the lower and upper part of the cage . this is a big plus you have easy access to the inside of the cage to put food and water dishes in the negitive is you can only reach in so far and then you have to use one on the two doors they have in front which are poorly designed . it uses the type of closer where you run a small bar down the side of the door that goes through little holes to keep the door shut they leave very little left after the last hole and the bar at the top you have to turn and move the rounded bar through a hole . im not discribing it very well but its not convieniant nor do i like how loose it is .in some of the other reviews i saw that people said it was flimsy if you go to any pet store and buy a cage i can tell you this with all the faults this cage has it still is far more sturdy then any ive seen at a pet store . ii do like the shelf under neith it makes it very convieniant to store the supplies for the birds . over time i can see the the pull out drawer that you need to keep clean will most likely not hold up but making referance to another product i buy on amazon i have found gorilla tape works miracles . all in all its not a super buy but it is an ok buy . the birds love it and dollar for dollar i doubt you would be able to find it at a better price and still have the good qualities it does have . i would have given it stars if it werent for how badly it was packed and the issues i do have with the doors .
i ve had several pods and have never really been impressed with their tone . right out of the box the hd totally blew me away . i know their marketing calls it hd because of the added tonal characteristics and it s true there is a huge difference between the hd series and the older pods . i can t really say why they sound better but to my ears the amp models sound significantly better than the older pods without much tweaking and no eqing although one can tweak the tone with several eqs .one complaint with the older pods that i agree with was that one could never seem to get a great high gain tone . this is not the case with the hd . i ve been able to get some great high gain tones out of it without much work .at first i purchased theline pod hd because i didn t see the value of the hd . after thinking about it i decided to pick up the hd and compare the two pedals . i definitely think the hd is worth the extra cash even for a hobbyist such as myself . there are extra controls on the looper and extra record time . the wah pedal seems to be better constructed on the s i could be wrong but i do remember them being different . the dual tone feature and flexible routing options of the hd are amazing . i m sure i m forgetting some differences but i know i m happy that i went with the hd over the hd .the drivers seem to work great on both windows pro bit and mac os . they have bit mac drivers now . the included software is ok i get the feeling they are still building it out . it s a bit glitchy but seems to work ok for the most part . the software updater works great and i ve already had a couple of firmware updates since i purchased the hd bug fixes . there is also a much anticipated firmware upgrade coming at the end of this month that will add six more amp models and several adjustable parameters that are supposed to really help dial in the correct tube amp feel and behavior .i nearly purchased the m to plug into myfender super champ xd electric guitar amplifier but i noticed the hd had the same number of effects plus amp modelling for the same price ! i know the two pedals are designed for different purposes but for me the hd made much more sense . i can use it to practice with headphones or plug into my amp as an effects pedal . to use it as an effects only pedal one need only disable the amp modeling and set the output mode to match the appropriate amp setup . i also decided to test playing the hd directly into abehringer eurolive b d active watt way pa speaker system with inch woofer and . inch compression driver which may replace my other amps as my primary rig i get the behringer today so we ll see .the build quality over the pod x live has improved . the case is now entirely metal vs . a combination of metal and plastic . i can definitely see this being heavy road gig worthy . i also purchased agator gk compact keyboard gig bag which fits the hd albeit very snugly .overall i m very happy with this setup and recommend this amp modeler effects pedal to anyone looking to practice at home especially with headphones on a wide variety of musical styles .i ve been using shure microphones live and in the studio for nearly thirty years now and i can honestly say that i can hear no audible differences between a genuine shure sm and this gls audio es .this isn t based on any scientific data it s based on a b ing this mic and a shure on the same tube amp at the same volume and distance going through the same mic pre . i made sure that i marked the exact location of the mic with a little masking tape on the amp s speaker grill . i recorded about seconds of the same simple chord progression first with the shure mic and then this one . when you play them back either through studio monitors or some very good bose headphones you can hear no audible difference between the two . if you were to examine the tracks in a waveform editor i m sure you ll see some visual differences but they are also two different performances but my ears really hear nothing audibly different . some may disagree but i m convinced .this mic is built solidly and weighs the same as the shure and for all intents and purposes looks almost identical both inside and out .is it as good as the shure ? i don t know i think so others may not . i do know that you can buy three of these for the price of one shure though . i d highly recommend these on guitar cabinets snare drums and toms for sure maybe vocals in a pinch on a particular type of voice .a no brainer as far as i can tell .before we get started i am more pro than amateur . i work at a church as a pastor of worship arts and use this in my work . but i hesitate to say i m only pro because amateur means you do something purely for the love of it . . . and i feel that way about music . . . so . . .first . . . the models i ve tested are far and away more realistic to my ears than other modelers i ve used which includes logic studio s amps these sound almost as good btw pod x live and xtpro the hd models are noticeably better . . . and the fizz is gone gone gone the original pod and . which sounded the same to me and made me happy at the time and the tonelab se which i missed for a while but not anymore .i made a few patches for one of my guitars based on having a bassman x alongside the dr . z and it is the coolest sound i ve ever made with this guitar . . . easily . better sounding to my ears than the real amps i ve been using maybe because i put them off stage and don t run them very loud . i adore the sound of this unit .oh and as always . . . forget about all the pre sets . they re probably all as useless as you imagine they might be .now the bad news . and it s significant . . . for some . . .first off editing is clunky like it was on the xt and x live . just forget about trying to use the display . connect to a computer . . . seriously . when you start from an init patch you only get lucky it seems to manage to coax it into two amp config . . .next the functionality of this unit is exaggerated by it s specs . you will almost certainly not be able to do fx at once the way you re thinking . why ? let s say you use an xt or a x . think about what you re used to .you start with fxsubtract effect banks for . . . . volume pedal you need to use an effect bank . you might be able to use an analog pedal but i like my volume after my compressor . . . so i have to do it in the loop i guess . . . . fx loop only works with an effect bank . . . line is there any way you can make this always active in a firmware upgrade ? seems like you could . . noise gate used to be always available . . . don t worry if you mix this with the m as i plan to do though as the m has a great gate . i mostly use clean or just barely broken up amps so i might be able to skip this . . wah this is always available and active in the x and below . . post eq . the x live had a final eq before final output that i liked a lot . in addition to all the other fx too . you need to dedicate an fx bank now .so . . . you might only have fx left . for me put in a clean boost and tube drive which i think sound better in this box than they did in the m . probably because they re digitally part of the signal is all i can think and a verb for the amp . no slots left . what if you need delay and modulation ? eek ! i have to re think the way i use fx in this box . still evaluating how that will work for me .what if you re a guy like me who was using the x live occasionally as a one box solution for a dual voice guitar . all my guitars have piezo bridges . no dice .i will have to use an acoustic preamp . no matter . i have one . i will probably dedicate a null amp to bring this signal into the unit and mix it .in addition there aren t as many computer recording routing options as the x live and the super sweet ability to switch between two fx chains in one patch instead of switching programs is gone . as far back as my old vox tonelab se i could literally switch channels from one amp cab to another in the same fx chain . you could do something similar on the x live . not here . also . . . line why on earth can t you make the midi in and out work as a usb midi interface with this unit ? how complicated can that really be ?in short . . . the x live has significantly . . . significantly more flexibility imho than this unit for many of us at least and ought not to have been discontinued imho . for some of you it s still a viable option .you also still might need your other fx !i thought it might be possible that this unit even if i needed to use my ag stomp for my acoustic side again which i m happy to do would bump my m off the stage . it did not at first but after a while i did indeed get rid of the m and don t miss it . . that said i think from what i m hearing that some of the fx especially the dirt pedals work far better inside this box than they do in the m when you connect it to a pod or amp .my favorite patches so far that i ve made which use the bassman model and the unbelievable dr . z model . . . far and away my favorite amp model evah ! don t leave any room for modulation or other special fx . i m not a switch whole patches on the fly guy . i turn fx off and on . but after a bit of tweaking and patch making i discovered that for my sounds i didn t need dual amp chains that often so i have all my flexibility back . . .so am i complaining about these limitations ? no . because the sound of this unit is so extraordinary . i d take off a full star for this shortcoming but the fact is the unit sounds good enough that i can t do it .there will at some point i hope be a next generation of this technology which will possibly address some of the usability shortcomings but i have to say for this price i am totally satisfied with the sound !in the meantime am i willing to trade the flexibility of my former rig for the sound of this one ? heck yes it sounds that good . i even love the models of amps i know i ll never use for the first time ever . . . . and after a few months of experimenting i was able to make patches that completely worked for my two voice guitar stuff . . . with no additional outboard gear if i didn t want . so i ve simplified to where i wanted to and no longer feel like i m really compromising anything .so . . . started with a rig consisting of the hd and sometimes an m and an acoustic preamp currently a yamaha ag stomp mixed in with the hd signal through the aux input . i ve now gotten to the point where i can do everything i want if i need without the additional pedals and i sold the m . i kept a few analog pedals and such that i just like but rarely take them out of the house anymore .i m only nit picking so that you will know all the trade offs . for what i have been fantasizing about basically an m in form and function with a handful of amp models shoved in the box this is as close as we re probably going to come . and did i mention . . . the sound ! it s seriously great !update ! i have learned that i will indeed have no problem replacing my m as well and sold it off . i thought i d miss it but i don t .update ! as of february i have supplemented this product with a black james tyler variax jtv korean and it s a marriage made in heaven ! if you are going to go with this product and if you are looking for a new guitar check out the new variaxes . totally amazing .
when i purchased the torin creeper seat i didn t take into account it might have a weight limit . i mean of course it would have some limit but nothing in the amazon ad that i saw suggested a very specific maximum weight of a person that the seat could take .it was therefore disappointing to see on the packaging the words holds lbs ! in big lettering on the front . i m a big tall guy at around lbs heck if i was lbs i d be a stick . so i thought i d just squash it if that s its maximum weight limit . . . but i chose to assemble it anyway since it was so inexpensive and just see how it handled my girth . first thing i noticed was it was mostly nearly all constructed despite the assembly instructions indicating i would have to mount the wheels and the plastic to the base etc . in reality all i had to do was bolt on the u brackets and the seat . done . took about minutes . the lower plastic was ever so slightly cracked though due i d say to over tightening at the factory but it s not a deal breaker and hasn t affected the functionality of the seat .once together i sat down and swung around one of my bikes and began to clean it . i have to say that the seat made a massive difference in my cleaning routine where often i d be laying on the cold floor . now i m sitting upright and much more comfortable albeit really low i might source taller brackets at some point as it feels short for a man of my height . but it s still infinitely preferable to sitting and laying on the ground . being able to smoothly scoot around the vehicle with tools in tow speeds things up hugely and is very welcome .at the end of about two hours of cleaning the torin tr creeper seat looked exactly the same and not at all squished thankfully and i m really glad i bought it .i bought this to pull small logs and brush around our farm . i got stuck in a creek bed which was much softer than i thought . my ford f diesel weighs over lbs with an extra fuel tank on it . it is a heavy truck but it s no semi or anything . i got pulled out by some guys in a smaller nissan pickup which was light enough not to sink in the creek . they took a rolling start of five feet not more which completely straightened out the hook ! ! ! i don t know if i got one that somehow missed the tempering process but what a piece of . just for more background the foot tow strap was rated at lbs so the force required to straighten this hook was less than that . it might as well have been made from aluminum . i can t complain too much at under but i thought smittybuilt meant quality . i wasn t taking a mph go at a stump or anything . i m glad that i could attach my strap to the frame easily enough . if it had been an emergency situation i d have been buggered .i m a newbie rv person though i m years old so took advice of others on blogs and ordered a and a hose for my new travel trailer . the threads on the female end are plastic so i m hopeful they will hold up . they do have a year warranty . i unrolled them today and had no kinking when i carefully stretched them out . since they were wrapped tightly for shipping i assuming under normal use they will serve their purpose well .
our little girl refuses to sleep in her bassinet and would only stay asleep on our bed close to us . because of the dangers of sids we didn t feel this was good enough so we would end up staying up all night with her . after seeing this on amazon we figured it was worth a try . it is working out perfectly . the baby has a soft comfortable place to sleep yet is protected from any dangers on sleeping with us . the walls of the bed are hard enough that a full sized adult will have a hard time rolling over the bed and child . if your child tends to sleep with you in the bed this sleeper is a must . the led light is a nice touch . perfect to check up on her in the middle of the night .we bought these when we converted our twins cribs to toddler beds and they had more freedom . protect your kids ! bolt down furniture so they don t get hurt !this is a must have if you want your baby to sleep in your room but don t want them in your bed . the first thing i should point out it is huge . i have a queen size bed and it is over half the length of it . it does making getting in and out of bed kind of difficult . the angelcare angelcare baby movement and sound monitor blue sleep monitor does work with it as well .note this is a heavy co sleeper . you could use it as a travel yard but it s way too heavy .
was upgrading the chrome on an mim . perfect fit . used switchcraft jack . includes screws and washer for the jack . looks great .only complaint is the size which is my fault . if you can buy at least a foot if you plan to use it on stage .our son loves this pedal board as it comes with a cover to use for transportation and plenty of connection cords . he has his now fully loaded with pedals he routinely uses . it looks very stylish and functional as well .

i initially bought this item to help with the minor pain i get daily from inflammation . however i find it works ok for the inflammation not as good as i had hoped but by surprise it certainly helps with my night sweats and hot flashes . they have decreased immensely and i don t feel so uncomfortable when i m shopping and break out into a great sweat . not sure which item in this does the trick but i m one happy camper . i sleep better too ! give it a try it s not a bad price either .i have one lone cockatiel but i hated watching him play in the flight cage that i had . it really was the right size for one but i wanted a bigger one . when i found this cage i just had to have it . i could not believe it i checked the size times to be sure i was not imagining this .normally cages of this size are hundreds more money that i was not going to do . this one at this price was intriguing to me . there weren t many reviews so i went by my gut .happily i was right this cage is beautiful i ordered it and this came in a very timely manner . i opened the box and could not believe the size as i was putting it together . it was easy to assemble i did it myself the only problem was that a piece was damaged during shipping . i contacted the company and they assured me they will fix the problem right away .before i had time to get upset about it the new part was on my doorstep . this kind of customer service does not happen to often .i subsequently finished putting it together . i got all the toys and branches and perches in places put charlie in it and stepped back to take a look .it took my breath away . this is huge i can safely put another other birds in there and still have room .this cage is not very heavy but for this money is more than any bird s will ever need .i am very happy i decided to purchase this cage it is beautiful and functional . i have small side doors the open with a spring . i have two large one on front and one in back that i can push my whole arm in for cleaning . the wheels work fine and i pull him around when i am doing things in another room they hate to be far away from us so the wheels are a big plus .it come with very large perches and feed cups that are actually dual cups in themselves so it is like getting cups total .on the bottom is a pull out pan that slides right out making it a breeze to clean .there is nothing that i do not like about this cage i am just thrilled with it . i am also thrilled and actually shocked that the customer service was so nice . i will not hesitate buying from them again . . .great transaction quick shipping i had just misunderstood that i was being sold a larger size and would need to measure it out for my small dogs . that said it came with everything i would need and worked perfectly ! ! i am now very happy and would buy from this seller again .
works just like it needs to . perfect fit for the tailgate on my chevy when the oem clip busted .works great . fairly easy swap . just be aware the front window regulators are the same on whether you have a suburban or tahoe or one of their gm family members . not so for the rear regulators . the full size suvs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones . the vehicle input feature amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference . the pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at but the vehicle id feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit . beware ! ! ! ! just so you know the dorman and fit the full size and the and fit the tahoe size vehicles .they do work . exactly as advertised . hane no fear on buying these . fit the chevy silverado wt tailgate rods .
i have been looking all over for a to z file dividers just this size . they are great quality material i am ordering another set for a different file box . i wish they had a larger size for letter size files .these are mm pouches and are a good value for at this size . i used them to make custom placemats for my yo daughter to give as birthday and other small gifts to family members . she draws a picture and we laminate it . pretty easy . keep in mind that these are mm which is clearly indicated in the listing but that mm is very thin . i wish i had purchased a thicker one for our purpose . also be sure that your laminator can take an . wide pouch .acco binder clips in all sizes are good binder clips . they come in large medium small and mini sizes . have used them for years .
i wish there was a guide somewhere that shows you what cars these sunshades fit . i bought this one super jumbo for my toyota camry hoping it would fit . well it did not fit . i had to return it and order the regular jumbo sunshade . the regular jumbo sunshade fits the windshield like a glove . quality is good and it folds up to about . so if you have a toyota camry do not buy this one ! ! ! order the regular jumbo size .amazon can you please look into getting some sort of reference guide that will show customers the correct vehicle application ? this would make buying this product a whole lot easier .cpsworks great . fairly easy swap . just be aware the front window regulators are the same on whether you have a suburban or tahoe or one of their gm family members . not so for the rear regulators . the full size suvs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones . the vehicle input feature amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference . the pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at but the vehicle id feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit . beware ! ! ! ! just so you know the dorman and fit the full size and the and fit the tahoe size vehicles .fits my john deere lawn tractor which is model la and likely it fits all the l la and d series lower end john deere tractors . please post a comment if it does not and i ll update this reviewcurrently amazon says it does not fit my third generation miata nc but it doesthese filters come top in most online filter tests and i use them in almost all my cars
i am a little disappointed . i could use a brighter light . i forgot how dim led lights are . i am looking to change if i can find something else .these are great lights for music stands . if you need a good blackout light themighty bright pedalboard light blackhas a red light that works great for dark stages . because they are led the batteries last a long time . some of the mighty bright lights also have an ac adapter option but this one doesn t .i bought this to connect a technics tt with an audio technica cartridge to my newer onkyo receiver with no phono input . the unit did work but i had to turn the volume to out of to get any reasonable volume . in addition i have an onkyo m connected to the receiver that i use for as a zone amplifier . with this preamp i am getting some serious spikes into the amp . they are not audible but the lights would dim and the volume from the zone speakers would drop . i do not have this problem with any other source so it appears to be some signal from this preamp .this unit may work perfectly fine with a behringer mixer but for my use it doesn t meet my needs at all . i am returning it .
very necessary when you have an aquarium a shallow mine is cm high and with this extension reaches almost to the bottom for the filter to pick up water from the bottom and not superficial .this tetra aqua product is easy and effective for making tap water safe for aquarium fish . i like that the bottle has a squeeze top and a cap has a narrow profile and adds both slime coat additive and dechlorinator heavy metal neutralizer . the product also eliminates chloramines .since chlorine and chloramine are both broken down with one tool it s a superior product over the novaqua water conditioner but only if you have chloramines to deal with you need to check with your local water provider .with novaqua you have the benefit of a product that adds beneficial water electrolytes but nothing to cover chloramines unless you also purchase the sister product of amquel . remember you want to add as few additives to your aquarium as you can safely manage to decrease the overall ion load on your fishes gills .the narrow profile of the bottle means i can easily store the bottle among my fish stuff . it slides in really easily on my shelf of fish paraphenalia . it s a nice break from all those round bottles that leave a lot of space unused . it s also more ergonomic squeeze wise .with the squeeze top i can choose to add actual drops for small tanks or use the cap as a cup measure for larger tanks . this takes care of a problem many conditioners have that are either established for tiny tanks ie under five gallons . . .where you should only add a drop per gallon and for larger tanks where you need a teaspoon for every gallons . so this one product can service those one gallon betta tanks from the squeeze top and those gallon tanks from the cap . there are also equal measure marks on the side of the container for making up really big batches of dechlorinated water . each raised measure equals ml or gallons . anyway i like that this container makes my life easier .it would be an even better product if the inside of the cap was marked for each teaspoon amount one gallon amount . as it is i only needed to measure out a teaspoon the first time poured that into the cap and then marked that amount with a sharpie for future use .in summary if you have chloramines in your tap water this is the product to get for conditioning your aquarium water . if you do not have chloramines then i suggest the novaqua water conditioner to add electrolytes instead .this is a stylish well made container for a betta fish .pluses high quality finish no rough or unfinished edges . the included vinyl background is double sided and appears to be waterproof or at least water resistant available in several colors to suit your tastes . kit arrives with water conditioner and flake food for the novice betta keeper . even includes small diameter gravel which is preferred for beneficial bacteria and the like .minuses water temperatures are subject to ambient temp of the room . bettas are tropical fish so unless your room is heated at degrees the water in this tank will likely fall below that range which will stress the betta . no light included . at nearly it would have been nice to include a halogen bulb light . the marine led light accessory sold separately costs more than the tank itself and does not include an on off switch . gravel displacement it would be neat if the gravel stayed neatly packed in the rectangular basket on the tank bottom . however it is far to easy for the stones to fall out of the perimeter and nearly impossible to fetch any of the gravel once displaced due to the size of the tank and gravel itself which inherently defeats the clean zen look . great concept but hard to implement .seems like people are confusing ethics and lack of fish keeping experience with this product . i have kept bettas in my office with daily bi weekly water changes depending on the container size for years . the main problem with this kit is the difficulty in maintaining a temperature within range that is comfortable for a betta fish . there are . watt heaters available that lack an adjustable thermostat that recommends that the temperatures be monitored . so if this is marketed as a betta kit it just falls short as a heater is needed . if this was sold strictly as a stylish container then i would give it stars .just for reference i originally purchased two of these as gifts for the kids and days later ordered two aqueon evolve gallon tanks to replace them . if one chooses to be a fish keeper do it the right way or skip the hobby all together . . .
these are one of the most popular treats we ever purchased . i like that this product is american made . the pieces are lightweight cubes and odor free .these treats are loved by my two small dogs .they clean there teeth very well and are economical due too the fact there are fifty to a bag ! ! !these tabs are great . the bottom feeders rely of them so much ! they are never in stock at the local stores ! therefore i buy count ! thanks !
love how soft these are and how useful they are for cloth wipes . they clean up well in the wash too ! highly recommended and cannot wait to buy some extras so i have them for my diaper bag .i have to say i love this . easy to use and most of all its clean .great warmer . can t imagine bottle feeding without it . well made and easy to use and clean . don t let calcification build up a lot or it s more difficult to clean .
these smead file folders work well . they come with plastic tabs and label inserts which can be placed anywhere along the front or back cover of the folder . my last set of file folders had pockets which i didn t care for . things kept getting stuck inside them . i appreciate that these smead file folders are plain . fancy isn t always better .these manila folders are cut meaning that there are three different tabs in the box of while this doesn t come out evenly i have yet to discover the odd folder . the tabs are reinforced and the folders are made of quality stock . the folders will do a fine job in any office and at home too .these are a must for busy overstuffed filing cabinets like ours ! the folders themselves are laid out the same with the indented tabs on the left in the middle and on the right what is different is that these ?they are a bit thicker than normal ones but what is awesome is the reinforced tabs ! these are double the thickness of the folder and just do not tear no matter how many times the folders get pulled out !do you know when you overfill your cabinet ? what happens all the tabs slap the cabinet like a card in a bicycle spoke . . these tabs can take a beating ! these folders definitely worth every penny !
i should have looked ahead of time at the other reviews and i can confirm that the pros are true but so are the cons . looks nice and professional and the way each sheet is designed is handy . but the paper is extremely low density so almost anything other than pencil or dry ballpoints will totally bleed through making the other side of each sheet unusable . and i agree that the cambridge logo printed on each and every sheet is incredibly annoying .these avery sheet protectors are very nice . i ve used them for a few years and i haven t had any problems with ink transfer or fading photos at least not yet . the sheets are very clear as opposed to thewilson jones super heavy weight sheet protectorsi bought recently which are milky white . i use the avery sheet protectors to store photos and my children s award certificates . they have served me well .whether i am assembling binders or portfolios for a professional presentation or tearing out a recipe from a magazine that i want to try in the future i always turn to avery sheet protectors to protect pages from wear and tear and the elements . i have found avery heavyweight sheet protectors to be the best sheet protectors on the market for the following reasons sufficient thickness and weight some sheet protectors can be of such a light weight that they flop over in a notebook . these sheet protectors are the heaviest i ve found . they do not easily crimp or bend when in your binder . clarity this product is completely clear and will not distort the appearance of a document . ease of use each sheet protector has a slanted corner which enables the user to easily separate the halves of the protector and slide a sheet inside . acid free you ve probably see sheet protectors ruin the print on a document or lift an image . these documents will not damage your document because they are acid free . i imagine that the acid free feature would be attractive to those engaged in scrapbooking . secure i ve never had a standard sized sheet of paper fall out of one of these protectors . once the paper is slipped in i feel confident is is going to stay put .while i typically purchase my avery sheet protectors through costco amazon s pricing has become more competitive for a product that i highly for professional and casual use .this product is made in china .
it is a really great chair for a toddler . it is super safe even with a wiggly toddler . love it !our toddler has been sleeping in halos since he was a tiny baby they re so practical and easy to put on .this potty is the perfect size for anyone doing elimination communication with her baby .my baby is still too young to actually sit on it but it works great for something to hold him over . the lip is especially great for little boys . plus it s light and easily transportable .i love it that baby bjorn has recognized the need for a smaller potty for the ecing crowd or those with smaller children wanting to use the potty .
scotch magic tape inch x inches pack what can i say . it is scotch tape . this company makes the gold standard of transparent adhesive tape in my opinion .gunner september i have been using scotch tape for i can t count how many years . remember the cellophane tape ? the stuff was sticky yellowed and messy . then along came scotch brand magic tape invented by m in . it was an improvement on the cellophane tape . you can handle it without tangling . it cuts easily and sticks cleanly . you can write on it and its almost invisible . the dispenser was also a m invention .whether you are looking for a roll of tape for wrapping presents or fixing a torn bill or sticking a label on a box scotch brand magic tape is the one to choose .if you hate dealing with packing tape with a dispenser then you will love this tape . it has the same quality and strength as ordinary packing tape . but you can actually tear off the length that you need without a dispenser . tearing the tape is very easy too . highly recommend this !
i have this paired with the behringer c studio condenser microphone . it matches the mic well color wise and fit . the c fits the mount perfectly . i recommend this mount highly .http www .amazon .com behringer c studio condenser microphone dp b cz rlk ref sr ?ie utf qid sr keywords behringer c later the mic is indeed the behringer c but amazon has provided it with the description belonging to the c u . unlike amazon s description this is not a mic that comes with usb plug phantom power and computer connectivity . and of course none of the advertised included computer software programs is included . it s a conventional studio mic that requires connection to a regular amp p .a . with an xlr jack and phantom power . it will not connect to the usb port of a computer without an expensive adapter and a preamp with phantom power . moreover amazon s form thus far is denying a refund and offering only replacement presumably for another mic just like this one ! if you want the described mic amazon is showing it from a different vendor at about more plus s h . the behringer c mic is the best condenser mic i ve used for the money its large diaphragm capable of reproducing some of the rich and deep sonorities of the costly high end mics at the radio station npr where i occasionally work . however behringer makes a distinction between the c and the c u . the description on amazon fits the c u not the c . so one way or another of the purchasers of this product are likely to be surprised and disappointed .indeed the c u is a phantom powered mic that doesn t require phantom power which it derives from the usb port of a computer . moreover the mic not only saves its owner the bother of a pre amp with phantom power but it also makes unnecessary a costly and time consuming xlr to usb adapter . it s ready to go just plug it into your laptop and start recording . i use sound studio but the included free software audacity works practically as well . on the other hand if the mic is a c as advertised be prepared to receive a conventional condenser mic with an xlr connector and a phantom power requirement found on numerous recording devices and p .a . amps or available on a neat little pre amp sold by amazon the a .r .t . .having just returned a keyboard the m audio pro sx for which amazon mistakenly provided the wrong description for the m audio pro not the pro sx i d be hesitant to place any bets on which mic the buyer will receive the c as advertised or the c u as described . at least if you re purchasing directly from amazon instead of a sub vendor you can be assured of a hassle free return . and if the mistake is due to amazon s description returns are generally postage free .i bought this as an interface between my mixer instruments and mics to my macbook for garageband . you have to go in and change the input and output in osx but it works great !
they re so useful for our purposes beer brewing ! this size is sturdy and just right for storing bottled beer and shelving it so it can age . i also love that they re very easy to store before you need them nice and flat and fit into small spaces when stored upright until needed .tops fit nicely and are sturdy enough for stacking too .it fits in my file cabinet correctly and dimensions were perfect . spacing is nice for binders and books . it does take a bit of elbow grease to get the little feet on the ends . they are rubbery plastic and its a super tight fit . great product though !these are sturdy easy to use sheet protectors . they are punched so they fit in your three hole binders they load from the top . they will protect your important documents and are non glare . very nice and easy to use . effective .
they fit my aquaclear . it s a snug fit but they fit . great for extending the intake tube as far down as possible . x x inches ? what is this a rubber snack ? not going to buy it if i can t tell what i m purchasing . this needs a better description .i have a tall birdcage and this makes a great shelf for my birdbath . it is discrete and fits nicely .
i have a snugride carseat . apparantly not all snugrides are considered equal when it comes to the base . i purchased this model thinking i would save money on my spare base . now i have to return it and wait for the more expensive one to come . how hard is it to include in the product information that it excludes or will only fit certain models ?i love this product . but what am i suppose to do with pink cup when i order blue . i live in england . no point to return it . it will take for ever . soo not happyi purchased this thinking it would be an adapter to hook up the ipod in an older model car . i have not found a use for it but there must be something electronic i have it will work with .
i decided i wanted to hang my guitars on my walls instead of having them take up space via floor stands . just find a stud and drill in the screws they ll hold just fine . i m really bad when it comes to stuff like this so i had my brother help me . just make sure you know what you re doing because i thought i did when i really didn t at all .the wall hangers look really nice in person and they keep the guitars held in place very nicely safely . the only thing you should have to do extra after purchasing and installing these is creating a makeshift wallpad for behind where the guitar is hung if something happens that makes it hit the wall it won t damage the guitar or the wall .this is as legit as it gets if done right though i ve had my guitars hung via string swing for months and i ve had no problems or concerns . i am very pleased with the cheap alternative to floor stands . it saves room and makes the room look cooler .i have guitars in my cramped little bedroom studio and i quickly ran out of space to hold them easily . floor space is dominated by my desk and drum set and i wanted my guitars to be out of the way and safe so they didn t get tripped over or dinged . enter the string swing .i have of them and i have hung everything from a fender bass to a takamine acoustic with no trouble .the y headstock holder pivots to accommodate asymmetrical headstocks like a stratocaster . just slip your headstock into it and the weight of the guitar finds it s own center of gravity .the base plate is an attractive open wood grain and looks like hickory . i didn t use the supplied wall anchors and instead drilled directly into wall studs .these are well worth the cost .i ve had this stand for about years and have used it on stage for the last years pretty steady . the first thing that broke was the piece that keeps that upper shaft from pulling all the way out of the base when you extend it the disclaimer here is that it was very cold and i immediately extended it to the maximum point always letting it hit the collar to stop it . it s plastic plastic and cold don t mix the retainer piece broke and went flying and i was standing there with my guitar stand in two pieces right before a gig . i managed to get it back together but now i have to be very careful when extending the neck . the other part that i ve been having problems with is the upper collar that mounts to the top of the stand and holds the guitar necks . it has come up completely off and i must continually tighten that hex screw to prevent the top from falling off . i won t mark this stand less then stars even with those issues because it really is a great stand . another person noted to pay attention to your guitar dimensions which is very good advice . long bass guitars end up resting on the bottom leg of the tripod .
the fender mini electric guitar stand is not made for the fender squire mini guitar . the guitar falls through . i will have to buy a differant stand for him rendering this one useless . the fender stand for standard guitars will not work on the size ether .fender a sx s jtxk feet performance series guitar cable ig good stereo cable for guitar or keybord .it s long enought . i recommend itthe boss me is not as nice as the boss gt and will not let you install boss gt patches by james limborg . i recommend getting a boss gt and then install boss gt patches by james limborg . now your guitar can sound like eddie van halen joe satriani and other guitarists studio album guitar sound with boss gt patches by james limborg . search google for boss gt patches by james limborg .
i had no reference point to judge the size of these picks perhaps compare pick with a quarter in the shot as a sizing method .good picks though .i have moved on to the carbon fiber and mm lexan jazz iii picks but these ultex picks are also very nice . they are a little less bright than the carbon fiber picks which in some cases is actually preferrable . in my opinion at least at the moment the jazz iii picks are right at the top of the list with the best picks you can buy . once you get used to the small size there is no going back . the large picks feel like your holding a refrigerator .you can t go wrong with these picks if you enjoy a full size pick . they have a better grip and a more full sound to my ears over the tortex picks . i have since went to the jazz picks but these picks are a solid product .
the hopkins sub zero all season windshield screen x is excellent in protecting your windshield from snow scratches in subzero temperatures .i would reccomend it to everyone to protect their car windshield in the winter .keep my bike outside for a couple of days in a row during the summer this has protected my f i from all weather including a hurricane could not drive through it fits great and does not blow offi love it . can also use to leave vehicle outside so the batteryminder tender stays dry in the garage if it rains outside . a must have for me . i want to protect this wonderful charger and keep it on the shelf not under the hood in a hot engine bay .

bought this because i wanted to measure the length of a specific body part of mine . unfortunately a ruler was too big to measure the length of it . i needed something very small in order to figure out how long it is .i bought two sets total . i use them near the middle of the lifting range which puts the saddle about to inches high . this is perfect to get my truck off the ground and give me an inch or so of ground clearance to r r the tires and do other work underneath the vehicle .i don t need t worth of lift but i like how these j s have a wide lifting range . with these set for my range as stated above they are not teetering at the top of the range like others i ve used in the past but are comfortably in the middle . they are very stable and solid units .it would be helpful if the info stated the lifting range of the units not just the tonnage they can support as a pair .min . lift height in . max . lift height in . sizes listed in reviews and the two in the description . x . x and . x . x don t match to what i received . . .the bag i received is in between what has been listed in the descriptions . x x empty .while seemingly a good quality bag with a fair amount of straps and attached rain cover hidden in the heel of the bag it seems the manufacturer or seller has no idea how to use a measuring tape !the bag itself is quite nice . . . good padding rubberized bottom to prevent sliding small pockets on either side and zippers seem of reasonable quality .for the price and bag quality i m not complaining . it works great on my cb and it does fit on the pillion of my vt c without having to remove my rider backrest so if you have standard seating or a touring adventure style this bag will do well for you as a pillion bag and with a little strap adjustments it also fits vertical on the front or back of a sissy bar or horizontal on a larger luggage rack . . .
does the job perfectly as described holds the tv above the dvr box and is attractive on the tv stand !does what it does and has what it said .works good so far .buy it when you can have compatible staplersits a normal cork board there are no bells and whistles with this . the oak frame looks like the standard cork boards you buy . the cork board itself is very light and was easy to mount . it can hold two documents side by side with some room around then to pin other things on the board or if your like me you just randomly sticking things on there that does matter ! for the price of it you think the wood frame would have a better finish stain on it . it does what its suppose to . . .
this cover does not fit a full size acoustic electric hohner guitar . i measured the whole at but this cover does not even come close to fitting ! it measures in diameter so check your guitar closely !this is a great value . i contacted the company for measurements inside the case to see if it would fit an ibanez rg series . it fits perfectly . thank youas a lot of epiphone owners have learned cases designed for the gibson es clones won t fit epiphone guitars as the epiphones have a slightly larger headstock . this case however fits my dot custom like a glove . the padding is perfect the top is arched to precisely fit the guitar and the build quality is better than you might expect at this price level .
fitted co sleeper sheet exactly like the one that came with the original bed . no shrinking in wash . shipped fast . will again in other colors .while it looks like it would be a great color it s poorly made thread count must be super low and when it comes out of the drier it has balls collected over it which also makes the sheet not so soft . go for the white ! i have a couple of white pack n play sheets and they are holding up much better ! !i registered for the ultimate crib sheet after reading reviews in books and online . all the praise is accurate ! ! ! it s better than the standard sheet savers because it covers the entire top of the matress not just one part . it snaps securely in place and can be changed in seconds ! i keep the regular crib sheet on the mattress for looks only matches bumper and skirt baby never actually comes in contact with it . get two or three ultimate crib sheets for easy changes so much easier to change than the regular sheets . . .removing and replacing the bumper for those sheet changes is a huge pain and time consuming . this product makes cleaning up so easy ! the only drawback is that it only comes in white but since it can only be seen looking into the crib it not a big issue for me .
can t really tell how well it works when i lift the tube above the water level of the tank it doesn t seem to push water out of the tube when in theory it really should . strange .however stuff does get stuck to it especially at the top of the sponge so there must be suction and it should be more than enough for the bacteria to get water movement .the blue floss sticks out a bit so it can be tough to position . once you do it does a great job of cleaning the water of particulates with the bonus that it doesn t impede the water flow too much so the bio wheel still spins freely .works great . takes off the sludge and or protein on top of the water for those who do not use a overflow . it was easy to adjust and maintains its level of skimming automatically . it has a range of a or inches before bottoming out . it will make noise and gasp for air if you do not tune it in right . once you do its great
i got these to mail slim dvd cases but a standard thickness dvd case fits also . i cut off the bottom of a plain paper invoice for the address label and attach it with clear packaging tape seems to hold as well as on kraft .the light weight film is easy to wrap over the dvd case to create an adjustable length envelope . the adhesive flap is also better than the wet to seal of a kraft envelope .lighter easier cheaper ! ! !these are great if you have a large quantity of papers . they are good for in boxes or outboxes and can accommodate large envelopes or large stacks of papers where others won t .what can you say about cardboard storage boxes ? bankers box r kive are sturdy file storage boxes that can hold either letter or legal sized folders depending on how you orient them in the box . the wood grain is not very convincing but probably looks better then plain white . handles make it easy to move heavy boxes . the boxes are easy to assemble but are better kept out of sight if aesthetics are important to you .
the feet on this bar slides off the truck bed sides and makes it worthless .when the ratchet is extended the mechanism for that ends up out of arms reach when standing outside the truck .i highly recommend these mirrors . i did a lot of looking and comparing before i bought these . i have a toyota tacoma and these things fit well and do a real nice job . they vibrate a little but not excessive . the little bit of vibration i see doesn t interfere with my view . i also do not extend them very far . the further out you go with them the more they will vibrate . just extend to the minimum needed in order to be able to see .before attaching to the vehicle i think it s a good idea to loosen the three screws holding the swivel in place on the bottom of the mirrors and work in a drop of oil . then do not over tighten these screws . they don t have to be very tight to hold the mirror still and not over tightening allows easy adjustment later . if you find they move when you close the door you can tighten a little more but to start off finger tight with the screwdriver is all you need . i also placed a couple drops of oil on the aluminum sliding bar and worked it in before attaching . also when you bolt the mirror onto the aluminum slide bar grip the base the part with the internal threads with a vise grip or something not too tight to crush it then make sure the lock nut is between the bolt and the bar on the bottom and then screw the bolt into the base and through the aluminum slide bar nice and tight without letting the base turn . you ll notice there are teeth on the bottom of the base . these are supposed to sink into the bar as you tighten the bolt . they keep the base from turning when you adjust the mirror . this is another good reason to not overtighten the three screws around the swivel . you want to be able to adjust the mirror from side to side and have it turn only at the swivel and without causing the base to turn against the aluminum slide bar .the bracket will bend the weather stripping on the outside of the window a little . it springs back when the mirror is removed but some of it will be permanent . it s not a big deal and you ll just have to deal with this if you want to use these mirrors . it is not a detriment to the operation of the window .i installed them as far forward as possible so that the top of the bracket was parallel to the ground and the new mirror sits right beside my existing one towards the outside . tightening the ratchet by hand produced plenty of tension to hold it securely . releasing the ratchet is another matter . it s too tight to just push it down with your finger . to release the tension i use a short piece of rope and loop it under the sliding buckle . then i stand right next to the truck with the rope looped around one hand and my other hand on the ratchet release tab . i use my body leverage knees and back to pull upward on the rope a little which takes just enough pressure off the belt to allow me to press the ratchet release tab . you don t need to back the ratchet off very far just enough to get the hook out from under the door . then just close up the bracket and wrap up the belt around it and you re all pre set for the next time .for better stability i advise when you re adjusting the belt place the sliding buckle as necessary so that the crossbar forming the angle is not extended very far if at all . and yes make sure there isn t any dirt behind the buckle or you ll get a scuff mark .you should have the windows all the way down when attaching to the vehicle . the bracket comes close to the window so you need to be careful not to let it scratch the window . after you get the mirror on i advise to raise the window very slowly to make sure that the metal bracket is not contacting scratching the window as you raise it . once you re under way be sure not to lower the window if there is any sand or debris laying on the bracket right next to the window or a scratch may occur from this action also . i ve taken these off and on several times now and we ve travelled with them and i ve been relatively careful and have never had one scratch my window .on my truck the doors fit really well and i can tell the difference when the hook for the mirror strap is hooked under the door . the door fits just a tad more tightly than usual . it has to be closed just a slight bit harder to make the latch engage and when i open the door it pops out ever so slightly because of the extra tension produced by the hook being in there on the bottom . i don t see this as a problem . the mirrors are not on there all the time and even if they were i think the latch mechanism on the toyota is stout enough to handle it without any long term problems developing . just be aware that the hook will slightly change thge way the door latches .the instructions are good too . not the usual loosely translated mandarin . i ve tried to supplement here with my own experience .i used this to replace a boat trailer jack that was welded on and didn t have a wheel . installed very quickly but had to cut down the bolts as they were too long in my case . rolls up and down very easy .
these markers don t need to be shaken up and don t need time for the paint to soak into the point . out of the box it makes a nice sharp line with even flow . it can be used to write on white black and translucent objects .my labeling isn t extensive . i m not cutting labels every day . but when i do i want to make neat labels that stay . dymo labeling takes does it in a way very easy to use is economical and stays put . the back peels off easily and application is nice . if i peel them off they come off clean so far without adhesive left behind .this pen actually makes writing fun . you feel like you want to write with flair almost as good as a fountain pen . it suffers from only drawbacks . it tends to gloop up a bit especially if you draw long lines . the point can pick up pocket lint requiring you to wipe it off before writing . you can t use this ink on shiny paper it will take forever to dry .
very good strap but the pick pocket does not hold the picks securely . especially when you take off the guitar for a break . either a pocket closure or a spring loaded clip is neededthis little geegaw is a stable tripod stand to hold the neck of your guitar while you restring it or perform other work . it folds into a nice small package you can store in the gear compartment of most cases . the rubber pads on the neck end prevent scratches and the feet keep it in place on the table . it may be best to invest in a non slip pad to place under the heel of the guitar body for protection and to prevent it from slipping around as movement can topple the stand if you re not careful . sure a suitably sized cardboard box or stack of books will also serve that purpose but what else would you spend the on ?fits nicely and tight on standard wide threaded microphone stands . if you have the smaller screw headed ends on your microphone stand you can get a little threaded adapter at any music store for next to nothing . maybe a dollar if they don t just give it to you . using this with stands that have a heavy round base takes up less space onstage and other places as well as making it easy to relocate and keep out of the way .no need for a tripod stand with the legs folding up and out getting in the way plus most inexpensive tripods are cheaply made very light and will break easily when moving gear or simply tripping over them .the base screws down all the way onto the stand until it is hand tight .the set screw allows for tilting and turning adjustment of the camera .the set screw presses against a ball socket hinge and has a plastic thumb knob that seems a little fragile . i am very careful not to over tighten in fear of twisting off the plastic thumb tightening knob .i am also leery of stripping the set screw or the threads inside the housing but at this price i guess you can t expect to have a sophisticated adjustment mechanism eh ?there is a notch in the side of the housing to allow for a degree preset angle .the metal thumbscrew that attaches the base of the camera to the adapter has a rubber washer as well as a thin rubber mat acting as like a cushioning gasket when tightened to your camera .be careful . the metal thumbscrew can easily fall out from the holding plate when transporting removing or switching cameras . i found a little plastic threaded washer like ring that screws onto the holding plate screw when not in use . you could easily find many types of washers screws plastic pieces etc . to hold it in place when in storage or transport . you could also leave it attached to your camera . either way be careful not to let it fall out and get lost .overall the little thing is quite solid heavy and sturdy and takes up little to no real estate and does a great job at being small basic solid and inexpensive .it holds well when bumped or moved . mine has absolutely no slop in it does not wobble or come loose . i would not put a larger sized mm camera or heavy camera on this adapter . most modern devices will do just fine .again just make sure you tighten it up just enough to hold it well . don t put the grip of hercules on it and it should last for years . mine has .i m happy with mine and bought our drummer one for christmas .hope this helps !
this cover does not fit a full size acoustic electric hohner guitar . i measured the whole at but this cover does not even come close to fitting ! it measures in diameter so check your guitar closely !does not work for all guitars . one of my guitars has a more rounded head and it does not fit over that anyway i have tried . though with the arrow shaped holders it works as it shouldas a lot of epiphone owners have learned cases designed for the gibson es clones won t fit epiphone guitars as the epiphones have a slightly larger headstock . this case however fits my dot custom like a glove . the padding is perfect the top is arched to precisely fit the guitar and the build quality is better than you might expect at this price level .
i probably should compare it to another to see how accurate it is but i really like how easy it is to use and turns off and on by itself .i was getting the dreaded cel check engine light on my car years miles . oh no ! what do i do ? what do i do ? i went to a forum posted the code and was directed to clean the maf sensor . well lordy lordy guess what ? my cel was reset and it has not come back on . this inexpensive can saved me at least a stealership repair bill . some people use other products that can actually damage the maf sensor don t do that .how do you rate these ? they do exactly what they are supposed to do . what more can i say . it don t stink no more ? ! lol
this is the absolute best price you can get on these playtex sippy cups . we chose the playtex after using soft tip sippy cups for a while . they don t leak they re easy to wash and the insulation helps keep drinks at temp warmed milk or cold water . i noticed before i bought these that people complained about the colors same with the straw cups which i also ordered it s not that big a deal ! unless you have major gender issues you ll get some cute designs that may or may not match the exact image of your child s gender . for example in two sets we got a navy blue space scene with red and while space stuff and a red lid a multicolored dino scene with pale blue lid a butterfly scene with most yellow and green with a pink lid and a purple and green flower design with a green lid .these items are awesome . the brush has soft bristles both are brightly colored cute design on both the brush and comb .this bowl is relatively hard for my daughter to tip over and it is supposedly dishwasher and microwave safe . these are the reasons i bought it . many other plastic bowls are melamine or contain bpas and should not be microwaved . that does not appear to be an issue with this one .the spoons are ok . they are a bit too wide and not as soft on teething babies gums as some of the more rubbery options on the market but they are fine and have nice stubby handles for babies to hold onto .my bowl did not come with a black spoon like in the picture . i received the advertised pink spoon but my secondary spoon was green . for me that was fine and even preferable but if for some reason you re really excited about a black spoon with your pink bowl beware .
works great for drying the car quickly and easily when its not hot enough out to do it quickly and you don t wanna have to polish out all the water spots afterwords black car . this thing absorbs so much water you won t believe it till you use it and it just takes a beating and keeps on going . when i first used it i was afraid i was gonna rip it by twisting the water out too hard nope just keep wringing it out until its dry and continue on .a little secret to using it at least i ve found it to work better this way . when drying the car lay the absorber out flat unfold it across the surface and then grasp it at one end at each corner and drag it slowly across the car allowing it to absorb all the water it comes into contact with . this works especially well on horizontal surfaces but still good enough on the vertical ones as well . this practice also helps to prevent scratching of the surface when small particles get trapped between the chamois and the paint surface and then your hand comes and pushes it right into the paint .little warning when it comes don t smell it . mine reeeeekkkkkeeedddd ! but i just rinsed it out and the smell went away . yes it is true that you can put it right back into the tube wet well to get it back in the tube you must because you can t roll it once it dry but i like to leave the top off of the tube to allow air in there to dry it out before i close it up and that musty gross smell comes back .long story short get it you won t be disappointed .so you drop it in your bucket and go about your business . when you dunk your rags or brushed the dirt and grit settles to the bottom out of the way and you can keep right on cleaning without changing out the water so often . i love this thing . wish i had it growing up .tired of being charged way to much pretty much everywhere for a min filter change ? i got this for my prius and you can do the install yourself in under min for almost nothing . never pay again at the dealer .your caf is located behind the glovebox . to get to it you need to open your glovebox and let it sit open all the way . empty out your glovebox . if you don t you ll be cleaning up the contents of your glovebox from the floor when you re done replacing your caf . next step is to look on the right side and unhook the dampener . next squeeze the rear of the glovebox sides inwards to be able to let the glovebox swing all the way down .looking inside you ll see a tray with latches on both sides . press those latches inwards and start sliding the tray out .when you put your new caf into the tray make sure you follow the arrow on the filter as the air is meant to flow through in one direction . the air flow is down . if you forget the tray has an arrow on it also that says air flow .to finish the job reverse the proceedures above . slide the tray in click into place rotate the glovebox up and let it snap into place replace the dampener bar then close the glovebox .
container is made in a pretty heavy duty plastic the hinge where the lid connects to the container is pretty weak but aside from that the rest is pretty well made . the lid has a strip of rubber foam along the outside edge where it comes into contact with the lid of the container which provides an airtight seal .generally speaking pretty easy to use and is as described .the specifications state x . x . inches . with the wheels it measures . in height . of course it will not slide into my pantry at that height .now i either place it outside in an unsightly plain view position or drag it in and out of the pantry . i will bet in a few months that the unit breaks after pushing and pulling since the plastic is sort of brittle . the corners of the wheels are flimsy and not engineered well enough for the added stress of daily maneuvering where the wheels attach to the unit .seriously pass this if you are on the bubble of a decision .the metal arms are solid so is the base but i don t know why the holes in the metal arms aren t pre drilled to accept the twist screws . it was also perplexing why the one arm was round instead of square at least the square arms have better grip traction for the crews . also mine came with no instructions and in general came very unprofessionally packed . for awhile i though i had gotten a used refurbished unit . also would be better if the wire loop hook on their deep dome lamp was wider to actually sit in the hook of the lamp stand rather then sit on top of it .
dymo s website has a software download for intel power macs this software does not work at all even though the mac sees the dymo sitting on a usb port it cannot print to it after a friendly geek struggled with it for the better part of a hour it finally decided to print labels even the geek does not know what he did to make it print so if it goes down it goes to my physical trash bin get with it dymo macs are taking over the computer worldpros . takes normal batteries . . bright well focused laser . . uses radio frequency communication not ir so you do not need line of sight to the computer . it will go through a wood podium . . works great with apple keynote and microsoft powerpoint . . works great with mac os x windows and linux . . no need to screw around with bluetooth .cons nonemany cute features on this phone include being able to program a name with a specific ringer verbal caller id just says the number or unknown caller different screensavers etc . the range on this phone is excellent and i can hear quite clearly from a distance . also being . ghz it won t interfere with wireless routers and wireless cameras . excellent buy !
perfect perfect size weight shape . i like the medium playing electric because it gives you the best of both worlds .recommended !these headphones are almost perfect . the sound is great good balance between highs and lows . they are comfortable too as far as ear pads go . the only problem is the size . these are for people with big heads or who wear headphones over a hat or who are buying headphones for their pet grizzly bear . maybe all the people at tascam have really big heads . mine is average and these slide down because the headband is too large even at the smallest setting . so minus one star for that . otherwise sound quality is excellent . comes with a inch adapter which is nice . good price .good quality one . i like the big size type . would like to have a thinner one . so far so good .
great price quick delivery awesome customer service from camco i ordered kits and one kit had one piece in the kit that needed to be replaced and camco replaced the entire kit for me . highly recommendedi was hoping to use the clay bar to remove water spots on a new truck but the one provided with this mequiar s kit was worthless for this purpose . the kit does include everything you need to apply the products in the kit which is a plus and probably the reason the kit is so popular .i installed this as an addition to a python system . the sensor was simple to install and the color coded wires and instructions were clear . for the price this is a lot of additional protection for the money .
i was looking at purchasing carbon in a bulk container and inserting it into a re usable medai bag . however after crunching some numbers it is actually cheaper to purchase this three pack than it is to purchase carbon in bulk .i only use it in tanks that i need to clear medication out or have inserted some wood that is releasing tannins and making the water dingy . in an ongoing bassis my filters don t include carbon . however i like having some on hand just in case . these prepackaged bags are handy and great to use when needed .wish someone told me about them can be recharged or i throw it out and get a new one they last quite awhile considering tank size . you can buy large container and they sell bags so you can make your own .i cannot say this is a perfect carbon bags but it works how it should work . there is no problem that i found to use it and i will reorder it whenever i need to order another bags .
works with a lot of mics and with a little modding it worked with my mxl v g which is all i needed it for .i purchased this to work with my ion system and my shure mic . arrived as expected very solid great fit . it works ! ! ! !works awesome 
works great but is on the small side as in not a large diameter gauge would be easier to read if it was bigger .great size for someone with a smaller dog and perhaps a smaller stature . i wouldn t recommend this amended size for a tall person .i have the ph flight cage for my parakeets and this large size cage cover was just the answer ! awesome fit great fabric quality made ! a 
this is my first slide i never use slide to play my guitar look good size is right for me . i just have to learn how to use it i really don t see how gibson can make and sell these for ! the tech at the guitar shop can t see how either . i plugged this into my roland micro cube and tried some effects . i was really surprised to see how well they sounded . i m not a guitar player so this uke is just a toy experiment for me . if you are really into electric sound i recommend going the guitar route . if you just want to play around a little this uke will do .i own a lot of guitars and have to change strings often enough i don t really enjoy changing strings but it needs done this tool makes it such a breeze i don t know how i ever went without it . it takes me a fraction of the time it used to take changing strings i can have them all loosened and cut in seconds where before i would stand there cranking one tuning peg for what seemed like forever . i am really happy with this purchase and will check out more stuff from planet waves .
love these microfiber cloths use it on stainless steel appliances and it leaves no streaks .use it to clean glass and windows and no streaks .use it also to clean and dry my car it absorbs water well and it also dries fast .use it with my favorite leather care lotion the whoohoo cleanleather conditioner and cleaner in one . luxurious leather lotion for your designer and fine leather goods . protect your leather investment . fl oz . made in usa ! for my leather designer handbags shoes and sofas .i don t have to worry about scratching the leather and it washes well .i bought the pack of and it s just a great value .will continue using these microfibers .this stuff sticks and works well . the only downside is that its hard to remove from you hands . best to use clear thin gloves when applying .when washing or polishing cars bikes or chrome microfiber rags work the best . i use them for waxing and buffing paint and they work great . i ust to use terry cloth the old school way . terry cloth still left some scratches in the paint but wasn t that bad . microfiber just seems to do a better job all the way around .
i love office supplies and anything that gets those lose papers off of my tables and counters . this corkboard is a perfect solution for items that i want to save but don t want to deal with right away .my last corkboard was actually made of cork whereas this high density cork fiberboard seems to be some time of manufactured cork that doesn t show pin holes . time will tell how well it holds up .this also came with two little plastic pieces called quick clips which slide into the frame and can hold papers . the most interesting thing about this corkboard was the fastening brackets .it comes with four large screws anchors and brackets . i had to read the directions twice before the measuring instructions sunk in . you can use the top and bottom edges of the board to create a line . then align the line on the bracket with the lines on the wall and make a circle or mark where you want to drill .then drill the anchor holes attach the brackets and snap in the board . it actually worked . attach the bottom brackets first before measuring and attaching the top brackets . if you follow the instructions this board will be flush with the wall and very stable . this is a nice product .from opening box to ready to use is only about mins nothing to do but attach the weighted legs and put on the movable elastic band that holds pages down .while a great idea this item is not designed well for all plastic construction imo .the only metal i can find is the threaded bolt on the adjustment knobs and what sounds like steel shot when you shake the base legs .the main plastic support for the books and it s adjustment point are very flimsy and it s a plastic to plastic contact area no matter how much pressure you put on the tightening knobs you can t stop the legs from flopping side to side by an inch either way . also slips down when you have heavier book on the stand .thought i must have them attached wrong but they are correct .maybe some masking tape under the clamps might close the gaps a bit and make it tighten up better .i would suggest that you never move it around with the legs attached as there is only a very small lip of plastic on the clear back board to keep it all together and when that snaps you will not be able to use that area again .plastic legs are make heavy by filling them with steel shot or bbs through a hold in the bottom and then sealed with a plastic plug pushed in then covered with one of the stick on foam feet .this could be a pretty nice item with the use of a bit of metal in the right places rather than plastic imo .i couldn t believe when i pulled this out of the box that it was basically set up ! the white board simply slides up and you screw the giant handles on the sides to add tension so that it stays upright . although i ran out of flip chart paper to slide into the top holder i very easily got a note pad in there and the design appears to fit perfectly with the top border of flip chart paper to make it secure . the only thing that i m not used to working with flip chart boards is that the base legs don t seem to separate that far but i ve pushed it and written on it and it s sturdy enough and won t tip over that easily . i love how it s one easy piece that is easily adjustible for height and is double sided so you could have a white board on both sides or white board on one side and flip chart on the other . very versatile .
plugged it in and it powered my rode nt condenser mic . i was delighted .i primarily use this as an usb adapter for my headphones so that i can connect convert the . mm headphone jack into my pc .the audio adapter is well built . it has a yellow led light that is solid when plugged into an usb port and blinks when there is a device that is connected to it through a . mm jack .installation was flawless . windows bit installed drivers immediately .no issues . no nonsense . simply works !the listing for this item can be confusing if you are not sure what stereo xlr is . stereo xlr is meant to be similar to your stereo headphones where left and right are separate unbalanced wires . this cable is configured to be a stereo unbalanced xlr to a stereo unbalanced trs cable . this item is not a mono balanced xlr to a stereo unbalanced mic cable .a little bit a soldering can fix this connector by moving the red wire from ping to pin with the white wire . pin then ties to pin with the ground wire .
no assembly flip open and use it . works on my toyota mini van fold up when done and lift using the built in recessed handle on the side . i am a guy and can carry with one hand like buttathis was larger than i imagined when i received it but that s not a problem . my only complaint is that the top feeding square doesn t open very easily . it jars the terrarium when it pops open . however i use this for temporary tarantula housing when i m cleaning their terrariums so it s not a big deal . i also carry it out into the field with me and use it to temporarily hold various amphibious reptilian wildlife to take pictures .this does exactly as advertized . the little ledge on the top makes it easy to slip under your litter box and it s easy to lift up and shake out over a trash can .
wonder why your fish went belly up cant figure out why the fish you added to your gallon bowl died in minutes ?nab a sample of water pop in your testing solution and see what water parameters are way off the chart . also good for people that want to save money on water changes by knowing when your water really needs to be changed instead of a set time because that s when you were told to do it every tank is different i have a water changer and i use this dose the tank turn the water changer to fill . there is a slight strong sulfur smell and it does not say whether it contains sulfur ? so if you have an allergy like me use it with caution . this is a must for cycling your tank ! if you don t know what cycling a tank is please google . how to cycle a fish tank . it will save your fish ! ! time and money ! !if you have fish you have to change or add water to the tank on occasion . hopefully you add water after you vacuum the gravel . i know when i vacuum my tank i take about gallons of water per cleaning . it s removed to a gallon bucket and allows me to move my bucket without spilling on the way to dump the water . be warned that the gallons of clean water weighs pounds . you need to lift it to the top of your aquarium and slowly add it to the existing water .i mix this water conditioner the night before i change the water . i put the conditioner in the bucket and add the water to the bucket so it gets properly mixed . doing this the night before gives the water a chance to reach room temp where my aquarium typically stands .i have found that using a medicine dropper is the most accurate way to get the correct portion of the additive .by buying this product on amazon you are going to save over of what your pet store charges .
excellent value and you know what . . . it is identical in every way with the retail store product ! same made in china product with another no name logo stuck to it . perfect for the garage band !if you own an american strat or tele this is a must have for the neck of your prize . i love this . it proudly states the guitar s origin of corona . california with the classic fender name scribed . wonderful . i have these on all three of my fenders . again these should really come standard on all american strats .one this is a long island company located in farmingdale new york . they are the leader in new technology of strings . . .
i bought this leash to augment an older model with similar specifications from the same company . the only difference between this new generation and the old one is that this comes with a little safety tether that is supposed to augment the collar and collar to leash attachment so that you don t sue them if the leash were to come undone and fly back and hit you . that addition is unnecessary and i don t use it but i can see why the company added it . otherwise this model of the foot medium weight flexi leash is pretty similar to previous generations from the same company .i use this leash for a pair of approximately pound pugs . sometimes both go on it with a coupler and other times one dog goes on this one and the other goes one our older leash .my only complaint about this leash is that it doesn t come in a longer length . about feet would be the optimum length for a leash for this weight class of dog .other than that one complaint about length this leash is pretty much perfect . it is designed to perform consistently over a long period of time is very user friendly and is well made .long sturdy the flexi cord is always taut . i ve owned two other retractable leashes and this one wins in all categories . the cord also retracts completely back to the holder . some retractable leashes don t do that making for that awkward grasp on your dog when you want him right next to you .i live in a townhouse complex and there are others walking their dogs . i try to keep my dog on a fairly short leash when other dogs are around . the only way i could do that until i got this retractable leash was to wrap part of the leash around my hand . not too comfortable ! this leash seems to make my dog heel better . oh and even though my dog only weighs pounds i got the medium large one for dogs up to pounds . i feel it adds more strength and it is not that thick and the handle fits my hand perfectly . i would definitely recommend getting this size even if you have a small dog . ii m no longer cutting off the circulation in my hand like when i was having to wrap the leash around my hand to tighten it just a click and it keeps my dog on a short leash . it feels very sturdy and well made .
i ordered this thinking it was the same size i get it the pet store because it was the same price . wow i opened it and it was double the size . . . .for the same price ! we so excited . great price !it is the exact same thing i buy at my vets . . .so why not get it at a better price here ?this test kit is the same as what is sold at your lfs . i got this one because of the great price even with shipping cost this cost was a lot less . all tests work as it should .
get the large one it s not too large but an appropriate size i would assume after receiving the large one that the small one is quite small . i have a lbs cocker spaniel mix and he loves treats . the quality is great and i have seen at pet stores at a very costly i price .great size for someone with a smaller dog and perhaps a smaller stature . i wouldn t recommend this amended size for a tall person .too big for my dog will have to give it to my bro . for his big dog .i wish the description had given the size of the balls and flinger and then i wish it came in a smaller size for smaller dogs !
does not kink rolls back up easily . the auto siphon doesnt work well via the faucet adapter if you are draining from a lower point but thats obvious many people like to drain from both the display and refugium . i just let gravity do the work instead of adding another adapter to my faucet . the valve is nice and works well . the plastic siphon to faucet adapter is cheap but i havent seen a kit like this that wasnt cheap plastic . bottom line is the part that needs to work does it right doesnt kink youll be happy with the purchase .purchased this along with a small air pump and bubble wand . attached to wand flow valve and pump with no problem . situated inside tank with ease and seems to do the job .the best thing you can buy for a tank that s gallons or more . i didn t think it would fit in my bathroom faucet because it doesn t have threads on either side of the washer usually only kitchen faucets have threads but when i got this kit in the mail first thing i did was try to fit the brass connector on . all i did was take a rubber glove for grip to unscrew the current faucet adapter then screwed on the brass connector and it fits perfectly . drains tanks in minutes also fills tanks . the on off valve on the hose is awesome .
this little gadget keeps my lift handle paired up nicely when mounted to my vehicle . it can get in the way when jacking but it is easily solved by just pulling it up onto the d hook on the top .this product is well made and comes in handy when you want to climb out of your jeep . it is easy to put on and does its job very well . the size of the grip itself is perfect as your hand can wrap around it for a good surface to hold onto instead of grabbing onto the roof .this buffer has plenty of power to get the job done and appears to be well worth the money . some minor assembly is required . there is a manual but it does not contain any instructions instead it mostly covers general safety . assembly is fairly simple . you first attach the curved top handle either with or without the straight side handle . the handle can be installed for either right or left hand operators . the buffer is top heavy so installing the side handle is highly recommended .this unit comes with the accessories to get started right away . for buffing it has a wool pad and rubber backing pad . for sanding a velcro backed hard plastic disc is included but you will need to provide the sandpaper inserts . a special wrench for locking down the rubber backing pad is included .controls are pretty basic . there is a throttle switch on the bottom of the handle with a lock button to keep the motor running . the speed control dial is on the top of the housing and goes from to maximum . the buffer starts to whine at around level and gets screaming loud at full speed when ear protection is definitely recommended . the amount of vibration will vary according to the task and motor speed . when sanding or buffing fine dust is typically produced so you may want to wear eye protection and a dust mask .if you are into weightlifting using the buffer on a vehicle may not be too difficult but for those not so physically fit managing the weight and vibration could be a challenge . because of the tool is about inches long your hands end up positioned about a foot apart in order to keep the torque generated by the buffer under control . just a little inattention can result in losing control or dropping the buffer and you don t want to hurt yourself damage your paint job dent your vehicle or damage anything else .the supplied wool buffer is quite thick and does a pretty good job but you do need to apply pressure for it to work . for the average sedan buffing the hood and trunk should be the easiest . things get harder when you do the sides or curved or irregular surfaces and have to both support the weight of the buffer and apply pressure to the surface . buffing non flat areas usually requires changing angles and varying the point of contact and amount of pressure applied . users will need to find the grip and techniques that work best . buffing will require some finesse at times and if your muscles are straining this is when accidents can happen or you can hurt yourself . doing the roof can be tricky as well .the listed weight of eight pounds may not sound like a lot but if you are bracing your body locking your forearms and squeezing hard on the handles for an extended period of time you may find your muscles a bit sore or in shock from the vibration if you overdo it . just go easy when using it for the first few times .the pictured buffer has a blue plastic housing and black handle but the unit also comes with an orange plastic housing . it has a ten foot cord with a twin blade plug and comes with a set of spare brushes . the buffer does produce very good results so if you have a strong back and the upper body strength it could be a very cool buy .
does what it does and has what it said .works good so far .buy it when you can have compatible staplersworks as advertised . the labels do warp a bit with age but this does not affect how they print or attach .nice heavy duty security envelope that has a self sealing edge and does exactly what it is advertised to do .
this stand easily supports my poundfender frontman r watt x inch guitar combo ampat any height setting . in fact even extended to the highest the this stand supports that amp with no issues from the center of gravity or weight distribution of the amplifier .i love the ease of setting up and breaking down this stand . it is essentially three parts the base and two removable arms . granted that this is heavy but the added weight is there because this thing is built like a tank .in addition to being rock solid the parts mate perfectly with no slop in tolerances . the support arms slide into the base with no friction or excess movement and the height adjustment has three nicely spaced positions . you merely pull back on the spring loaded knobs to release the safety pins that engage the arms for position . once you line up the holes release the knobs and the pins solidly engage and hold the amp in place .my only complaint and it is more of a wish is the tilt of the stand is at a fixed angle . i would love it if i could adjust that too but i am sure that it would drive up the price of the stand . one final note these significantly increase the footprint of an amp on stage . specifically it increases the depth dimension by nearly of my frontman r although the difference in length is nominal . i mention this so you can factor that in if you normally play small venues with cramped stages .overall this is an excellent stand and one that is stable and heavy duty . at the current price at the time of this review it s a bargain .if you understand what this is for i think it s a great idea . maybe not a perfect tool but i believe it does what it is supposed to and does it well .keeping in mind i m a guitar player who just bought a drum kit . . . my assumptions when using this are that drum tuning is relative meaning that of drum pitch is established by ear based on what you want each drum to sound like unlike a stringed instrument which is tuned against an absolute reference frequency and each string has a distinct relation to the others .the concept with this torque key is that it assists you with applying equal tension on each of the tension rods therefore presumably having an equal tune all the way around the circumference of the head . it by no means will help you establish as specific pitch on any drum it simply helps you achieve an even tension and relative pitch all around the head . the tension numbers on the torque key are for reference only is tighter than is tighter than . . . and so on . yet these numbers are only relevant to each head i find that you don t necessarily pick a number such as and tune all the drums to that .the way i use this right or wrong is that i tune an approximate tune on any given head using the traditional method of tapping around the perimeter and tightening apposing rods as necessary until the pitch is the same all the way around and at an audible frequency that i like for the drum i m tuning . now theoretically you re pretty well tuned anyway but this is when i grab my torque key and i set it to a number a bit lower than were i expect the torque is this only comes from experience of using it a few times then i check a tension rod and i increase the setting on the torque key until it no longer breaks over . now whatever number i m on is the reference number for that drum . my process from here is to move around the head in the same crisscross pattern as you would tuning traditionally but i loosen each rod a bit first and then bring it back up to torque with the torque key . after this process my drum head should both be at a pitch that i have chosen by ear and have equal pitch all around the drum head .i believe it is a common practice to use a slightly different tension on the bottom side head ether a little tighter or looser than the top side typically a little lower pitch on the bottom ? . once you ve tuned the top head and you know what number you ve used you can quickly tune the bottom by reducing or increasing a click or two on your torque key .sure there are a few other variable that can come in to play like did you seat the head adequately when installing it which in essence means did you apply some light pressure to the center of the head while drawing down the tension rods in small equal amounts in a crisscross pattern . also how are the rims of your shells are they well machined and smooth ? these may impact the ability for a torque based tune to work . how about your tension rods are the threads clean are they lubricated ? any variability in resistance of the threads on your torque rods will directly translate to pitch in that location . again i m just a rookie and i may be off with some of these assumptions or they may have an essentially unmeasurable impact so take it for what it s worth .once you find a tuning you like you could write down what number it took to achieve the pitch you like on each head that would make it easy to quickly get back to the same pitch if when your drums need to be tuned again .well built . the adjuster end is deeply notched so it can be set for a wide range of angles in about or degree increments . possible positions between upright and horizontal best for setting up drum mics as it would hold position better than a gooseneck . i m using it in a vocal mic application as it pushes the mic a tad further away from the stand to give me a bit more room . but there is no counter weight here so its best used at shallow angles . if i was playing a thicker instrument like an acoustic guitar or if on stage energy has you moving a lot more i would opt for a boom stand instead .
it s great to use for your chick brood as you can slide the flat bar under the edge of the chick brooder . it adjusts to the height you need weekly for newly hatched chicks . i wish i had purchased !these hold a . oz can of cat food perfectly . they are deep enough to allow you to mix supplements or medication in with a . oz can without it falling out .this dish is a perfect size for my rabbits . it is heavy so they can not tip it and spill out their food every wheres .
i love these pens . the variety of color alone is fantastic but the actual pens are great too . i m huge on organization by color and the fact that i can get so many colors in one pack is perfect for my needs . i also like the fact that the package it comes in serves as a case for all of the markers .what a great set of markers ! the first thing that attracted me to this set was that there are so many great colors . plus they have awesome names like fandango pink and tranquil teal . i love creative color names ! what can i say i was an art major in college . there is a lot to like about this set so i ll do a pros and cons style review here .pros comes packaged in it s own folding storage case great colorscolor name on the marker love that ! color of marker is on cap and end of penacid free inkrubberized grip for comfortnice size fine point not too fine and not too bullet ycons nothing that i can findcomparison to sharpie the fine tip of the sharpie is a little broader than these . i can t say whether or not these bic markers last as long or longer than sharpies i haven t had them long enough . these are permanent markers but it states on the back of the package that they are not recommended for use on cloth . fair enough .if you are looking for a great set of colorful markers i do highly recommend these !they are pens . they have blue ink . they write in multiple languages . they can do math and science too . my new pens are amazing and my life is better for having them .
purchased this to use as both a parking stop and a target to use for aligning my trailer when parking in my garage . it is very well made as has been my experience with other camco products . anticipate the adhesive on the underside will suitably secure the accupark to the concrete floor to maintain a consistent location .i use these caps in conjunction with the lynx levelers to create a flat surface for the camper tire to sit on . i also use several under the jack tongue to minimize excess jacking when leveling the camper from front to rear . they can also be used under the corner stabilizing jacks to create a flat surface for the stabilizer feet . would highly recommend .we have a typical pull behind travel trailer . this drainer works perfect . it doesn t hold a lot it is for a camper sink but keeps clean dishes off the dirty sink bottom .
primarily they do what they are supposed to for my ft . trailer . work well and easy .secondarily they came shipped in their own box which is weak enough to need an outer box arrived in pieces but all metal held up though scratched . needed to be a little less green to package the weight of metal stands .right part number and looks good . clean package box although the tube ends did not have the caps like fram but will take motorcraft any day .these are great but they didn t come with a bag . thetri lynx lynx leveler for rv leveling block with nylon storage case pack of comes with a very nice bag that would actually work well for these wheel chocks . it would be nice if they had included that or another bag for these that would have earned the product stars .
pencil is nice heavy weight feel to it the cap is a gorgeous color however the back half of the pencil is a cheapo plastic that does not even come close to being the same color as the metal cap . they should have made it the same material . this is an expensive pencil and should be made of metal not half plastic .i got this primarily for cutting photos . very sharp blade . . . cuts are very smooth and precise . the entire cutter aside from the blade is made of plastic . . . it s extremely lightweight however it s also very sturdy . my last two cutters were made mostly of a wood base but this board seems more durable then those .extremely happy and would recommend .this pen is super nice the write with . the tip has no flex and the pen is height quality . the charcoal exterior is made of a thick plastic that is slightly textured and feels wonderful to grip . the pen clip is made of a coated metal and anchored down extremely well . i have had no issues with skipping .
if you ve ever put together bankers boxes you know how time consuming this can be . . .and how it can be tiresome . . .fret no more as these boxes are very easy to set up . all that s really needed is to press the sides down and then tuck in the bottom flap . that s it ! within minutes i had a fully assembled box ready to use .another bonus is how nice these boxes look . these are not the ordinary ubiquitous white boxes but a very nice wood grain brown pattern .they also feel sturdy and i look forward to using these boxes to store my home records and computer stuff .highly recommend .you can order clips to hold the boxes together when stacked up straight from fellows free of charge . this info is printed on the file drawers . i emailed customer .service fellowes .com with a cut and paste invoice from amazon and they shipped out the clips for free right away .assembly is quick and simple . a year old can do it literally .basically this is a very sturdy cardboard box drawer that fits inside a larger box shell . the inner drawer has plastic snap on sleeves to hold file folder hooks and the front portion of the outer box is reinforced with a metal frame . these are the sort of boxes you might want to store things you need to access a few times a year up to once a month . they are sturdy enough for things like books as well and the file drawer can be slid out from the outer box even when completely full of paper .these would also be quite useful for stuff other than papers . out of season clothes if you have a deep closets are easier to access from these drawers than from the plastic bins we typically use .the advantage to this system is that you can assemble the boxes as needed . the disadvantage is that the boxes are certainly not as sturdy as a metal file drawer system . i do prefer them to the cheap metal drawers but i think a good used metal file cabinet can be found at surplus for not too much more than these boxes . on the other hand if you need a lot of them these files drawers would be less expensive . i am deducting a star for cost for cardboard even very strong and well designed cardboard these are a bit pricy .directions for the butterfly clips for attaching the boxes as received from fellowes . . open all flaps for all units drawers to be attached in a column . . insert one clip in both the left and right of the stacked shells between the larboard and the wire frame of the upper and lower units . . clip should be inserted with the open slot of the clip facing into the shell . . once all the clips are inserted all the front flaps can be closed securing the clip in the shell . they mean the drawer part when they say unit and the outside box that it slides into when they say shell they were easy to attach and improve the stability of the stack of drawers .i like this smaller box but i m not sure how well the bottom of the box will hold up under a full load but time will tell . on the vine program reviews have a time limit on which they need to be done so there is no waiting to see how well something holds up long term and that is the point of these boxes . long term storage . i have found that with most of these boxes the lid tends to be difficult to bend and fit into place and stay . perhaps they need a bit more space to bend it and attach into the slots .

i own three halo sleep sacks a cream colored one the one with sweet peas on it and this baby blue one . the other two are wonderful soft and cozy . . . .but for whatever reason this blue color feels terrible ! ! it s rough and scratchy and stiff i hate touching it so we ve stopped using it . i know it makes no sense . but if you re thinking of picking this blue one maybe pick another color or a blue one from another listing instead .the green pink blue versions with the cow jumping over the moon are perfect for restaurants that don t have tablecloths . easy to wash and store in the diaper bag . yellow hippo version seems different sticks to itself a bit too much but is still effective . i don t recommend the yellow one unless you just love yellow . yes there really is a difference !i just love this whole color scheme . we painted our son s room blue and got every piece to this set . it is just such a nice change from the baby blue with pastel colored bedding sets . it is definitely a little boy s bedding set . some many things match it outside of this collection too because of the blue and red combination . the sheets wash well too which is a nice plus .
i read the reviews on rubbermaid storage and sure glad i did buy that junk . this is made pretty good . it has a foot latch on the bottom and a place for a lock on the top of the doors . i m not sure yet if anyone makes a lock that will fit it though . ordinary padlocks won t work . you may be able to find a long hasp lock that will fit . i have two split rings and a small lock on it right now . not much security but it keeps honest people out . i have it on my newly built patio and i attached x s to the wall and screwed the cabinet to them . so at least someone can t walk away with it .you need to get some small screws and nuts to hold it together . it pretty flimsy but is okay when you add your own screws . nothing like rubbermaids junk though . there are no black holes or other items in the nightmare reviews like those on rubbermaid . i m an aerospace design engineer so i see plenty of design features that could be better . but for the i paid for it and a few screws it s okay .i bought this arm based on the reviews . i was thinking i could get a monitor arm for around and i can but i wanted to buy one that worked right and i could just install and forget about . this ergotron was what i was looking for .it s heavy and solid . it comes with everything you need to install from a corner edge or if you need want to drill a hole in your desktop to mount it . you get all the tools needed and very clear instructions . ergotron just does it right period .i m currently using this model to hold up a x monitor it works like a charm . i chose to drill a hole though the desk for the mount and i even modified the nut a bit so it could fit in a tight spot .it s easy to adjust just loosen the hex nuts with the included tools put in place and tighten . i have mine tightened to the point where the monitor stands still but i can move and tilt it when needed .overall i m happy with my purchase . also seriously considering the big ergotron arm to hold up my imac so i can have both monitors float .first of all the instructions and i use that word loosely on how to put this together are horrible . there was no way i could figure it out by looking at the pictures i had to fiddle with it until i figured it out on my own . you need to unscrew the legs which are heavy because they re filled with sand and then slide them on the appropriate sides . after the legs are on then you ll see that the holder can be adjusted either forward or backward . then the elastic slides on each side and also can be adjusted up or down .i know this is advertised as a document holder or copy holder but the reason i wanted it mainly was to hold knitting or crochet instructions and charts and use the elastic to show where i was in the pattern and it works perfectly for that purpose . but i have also found that it works great to hold my ipad up so i don t have to physically hold it . it is larger than i thought and you need a lot of space on your desk or wherever you put it . i actually put it on a separate stand .as others have mentioned the price is high for what it is and i can t really justify paying that much for what it s used for .
i use this on my dark grey ford explorer because the ohio license plates are white . this looks very nice on the dark vehicle and i have not experienced any troubles with law enforcement in the state of ohio for the shield being too dark .my harley has a lot if black on the motor . it s a and very gradually the black will loose it s rich dark look . this product really brought back that dark rich look . i recommend it .this does not only protect but cleans stains road film etc . off the paint and bring its to nice clean shine . my cars have ranged from light colours white and silver to darker colours red and blue and this works perfectly to clean and protect . sometimes depending on how dirty the paint was applications would be done to restore the finish . safe on clear coats and glass this is perfect . also one heavy shower does not remove the wax . give it a try .
seems to perk the corals up when fed ! easy to use along with tube squirt from kent marine and is easy to apply .reads the temp in c or f and seems accurate .it does what it is meant to do and does it very wellnot sure why this did not work for me . all water parameters were excellent ergo not a bacteria issue . wound up doing large water change to clear things up .
i had an older paper cutter and its not working that well anymore .the blade is dulled and i cant find a replacement .this one is compact compared to my other one but using can be a bit awkward .it works well for thick paper such as photo paper and craft paper but thin sheets tend to tear easily .it has a swing out ruler which makes larger paper easier to measure and cut .it has a cutting blade and a scoring blade but i only used the cutting blade to cut down a couple photos .it needs improvement in the blade .its titanium but i think a razor type blade would be better .there are much better cutters available and would probably do a better job .westcott makes mid price scissors trimmers and office supplies . the trimmer is titanium bonded which means the blade stays sharper longer than regular steel blades .i used this for a couple of projects and it cuts multiple layers of paper it has a swing out ruler that is easy to use .over all i give it a b the westcott titanium bonded trimmer with scoring and cutting blades is well made and works efficiently on regular paper cardstock and laminated cardstock paper . very little pressure is needed to create a clean edge as long as the blade is sharp . the grid system ruler bars and swing out ruler make lining up the paper easy . finding the right position for cutting can be a bit tricky at first but once you get use to the location needed for precise cuts it works nicely . i find that cutting multiple sheets of paper can lead to slightly differentt cuts on each sheet due to shifting so this unit is best suited for single sheets in my opinion . the blades are easy to change out once you get used to the method of removal . the scoring blade works nicely on both regular sheets as well as cardstock . overall it s a good unit for the price depending on your needs .
i don t know how much i can say about this . the wafers are quite small about a inch across or smaller . i didn t measure them . but they are small . anyway they sink to the bottom . the catfish find them and get down to eating ! they seem very enthusiastic about them . i would and will buy more when these run out .the bag says that it is pre rinsed . . .don t believe it . . . .i place in a gallon bucket and ran water a hose at high pressure for about minutes and it is still chocolate brown . i am afraid it is washing away some good silt but the bag says to do it . .i will bet i lost about a pound of silty material . . .it looks like small pieces of lava rock or cinders . .we ll see what it does lateri am using several of these for my aquaponics garden gallon fish tank . i just have them laying over the side of the tank on the bottom about feet deep . the amount of air seems to be just what i needed for my size tank any the lph air pump . only drawback is they do in fact float on the one side . this isn t really a problem for a tank like mine but i can see it being a problem for a home aquarium unless you weigh it down . i noticed there is a spot on the back about the size of a dime that you could actually put in a couple of fishing weights in and then seal it with silicone over the top . that should keep it down and i might do that if it later causes a problem .
the filter max iii pre filter was a great buy . i use it as a pre filter on my aqueon hob filter . the filter max helps keep the filter clean and allows me to extent the period of time between filter rinses and cartridge changes . this in turn really lets the biological filtration establish itself both in the filter and on the sponge .i like the filter max so much that i have purchased another for my penguin . . .the only challenge with that will be matching the round pre filter to the rectangular intake on the hob filter . . .but i will figure it out !over the past thirty years i ve tried about every air pump there is and in my opinion the rena trumps them all .these air pumps are quiet efficient and with minimal care should last for many years . like all air pumps replacing the intake filter with new ones is imperative for keeping vibration and noise at a minimum .the is perfect for tanks ranging in size from gallons .they re easily adjustable dual output ports let you configure just how much air you need to drive your aeration bubble wands walls air stones sponge filters power heads and so on .the hundred is the largest in the line and like all rena pumps their curved design and expansion chambers keep vibration and noise to a minimum .replacing the diaphragm is easy to do on these pumps just remember to buy two replacement kits one for each intake port .quick specs powerful dual out put dual control valves year warranteelike any quality air pump keeping a drip loop and using check valves in your air line tubing is essential .add the mix changing the air filter from time to time and the rena will reward you with years of efficient trouble free service .this is a great little filter . it pumps gallons per hour and has loads of filter media for a powerfilter of this size . don t be fooled by the inefficient filter cartridges used by other brands . this is the filter you want .
it filters oil and comes with the gasket and crush washer you need to change the oilthis is one the best oil filters on the market for the harley davidson motorcycles . i use these filters on my harley davidson fatboy motorcycle because they do a great job in filtering my oil . the oil filter on my harley is mounted on the front of the engine . this location plus the fact the crank position sensor is in the way of using most oil filter wrenches you have to buy a special wrench which will slip in use to remove the oil filter . this oil filter has a mm nut welded on end of the filter housing this makes installing or removing the oil filter very easy . you don t have to worry about damaging your engine crank position sensor which are expensive to replace . i highly recommend this great k n performance oil filter for any harley davidson motorcycle owner who uses regular or synthetic motor oil . great price and it s chrome plated to boot .part number fl smanufacturer motorcraftdearborn mioe number f az bdoemanufacturer fordoe number xw e daoemanufacturer fordengineered specifically for ford lincoln and mercury vehicles each motorcraft oil filter including the popular motorcraft fl a uses as many as high quality components . construction features include steel cases ironed for a precise fit fluted to ease removal and painted for rust resistance . pressure relief valvewhen it s cold outside or if the filter becomes clogged oil flow through the filter can be reduced . if this happens the relief valve opens to provide a continuous oil supply . its design also minimizes the chance of contaminated oil recirculating back anti drain back valvethis feature keeps oil in the filter to prevent dry starts after your engine has been turned off . it s made with specially formulated material that resists the aging effects that an engine s heat can cause . efficient filter mediare engineered media increases motorcraft filters dirt collecting capability allowing them to capture more engine harming particles than ever before .
i have a medal banister on my stairs and have been having a lot of trouble getting a gate to fit . the kidco gate in combination with the y spindle has given me a safe and secure option for the bottom of my stairs .i generally like the look function of metal gates better than plastic ones . however when it came time to select one to install in our living room at the top of our stairs i didn t want one that had a metal trip bar along the bottom of the opening as most metal gates have which enable them to be pressure mounted . i selected this one because it had good reviews no bar across the bottom of the opening that can be a tripping hazard and we were familiar with the style as there is one at our son s day care that is very similar .we installed this gate at the top of our railing with a hardware mounted install and a newel mounting kit and so far are happy with it . one advantage of this gate i have recently discovered is it can be left open with the door swung to the side and out of the way enabling free easy access to the opening at the top of the stairs for those times when we don t need the opening secured . though not as flawlessly easy to use as a metal gate the open close mechanism is not very difficult to operate and seems very secure . you do need to put a small amount of effort into pushing in the button to pop up the handle when opening the gate and making sure the feet line up correctly when closing it . our month old has gone up to the gate and pulled himself up on it several times and it has shown no signs of being dangerous or unstable . the plastic paneling is very susceptible to fingerprints . we have only had the gate for a little over a week and i already see a number of them . i am sure the panel could be easily cleaned .overall i am very happy with this gate and would recommend it to anyone worried about the trip hazard of a metal gate at the top of stairs . i also highly recommend a newel mounting kit for anyone with non square newels which allows this or any other hardware mounted gate to be easily installed .i needed a gate for the top of the stairs and searched amazon for baby gate top of stairs . this gate is the second item returned . nowhere in the description does it say that this gate should not be used at the top of the stairs . of course as soon as we opened the box the instructions clearly say do not use at the top of stairs . the gate works great in the upstairs hallway but we ll still need to buy a different gate at some point if we want the baby to have access to our room .

this product is great . the shipping was great . so far this has lasted me months and going .i have a yr old dog who get s this with his food days per week on top of his supplement pillandi will definitely buy again in the next days .i have used frontline plus for over years . it has always been great for fleas and ticks . over the last months i have found it only works for weeks after application . by about weeks i am starting to see fleas by weeks they are biting the dogs making them itchy and it is not killing them . i plan to call the manufacturer as i have dogs and buy this in bulk for the year .i applied this to my lb . miniature schnauzer and within weeks i saw live fleas and ticks on him . switched to k advantix ii and so far he s been clean after a month .
i purchased this applicator separate from the kit . the kit did not show or list the applicator . now that i purchased an applicator for almost and the separate kit i see the applicator pictured on the box . i could have saved had the item been properly listed . if i return the applicator i do not need it will cost as much to return as the credit . so i have two applicators one i do not need .i purchased this toner cartridge to replace the original toner that came with my brother n laser printer . i ve been extremely happy with the brother laser printer s performance and durability but i was on the fence with regards to choosing the appropriate toner .i had considered alternate toner manufacturers including the generic brands offered by various office supply stores in town but in the end i opted to go with the brother manufactured toner . in my own research i found that the generic brands tend to be remanufactured units instead of new that offer mediocre performance at best when compared to the manufacturer s own brand .the box comes with the toner unit encased in protective plastic . it also comes with a pre paid label that you can use to mail the old toner back to brother . the fact that the manufacturer is environmentally conscious was a very pleasant surprise . two pre paid labels are included one for the states and one that appeared to be international .anyway the new toner was literally a snap to install taking no more than seconds . i m printing great copies once again and am very satisfied with my purchase . i will definitely purchase another brother replacement toner cartridge again . i will also buy again from amazon as they tend to have the best price on this particular unit .highly recommended .although the cartridges look like genuine canon they did not come in the canon packaging shown in the illustration which i find worrisome .the price i paid i paid is the price of fresh genuine virgin canon not the price of a cheap refills oem rd party cartridges counterfit cartridges or out of date repackaged cartridges .amazon promptly offered a full refund if i ship the cartridges back but that really doesn t solve the issue .i suggest contacting the seller and asking for assurance that the product is fresh virgin original canon cartridges in original canon packaging before purchasing .
this tascam us usb audio interface is exactly what i was looking for to record from our wireless mic with xlr outputs directly to my pc video editing software . we professionally produce instructional videos and needed this for voice over work on existing footage . before getting this convenient little unit we had to record into a camcorder and then import it into the pc so this saves us a step when we only need to record audio . here are my observations plug and play connected to my pc via usb and was instantly recognized usb powered no external power needed a big plus when using my laptop good sound clean and clear input multiple inputs xlr mic rca stereo line and hi z guitarmisc xlr input is not powered not a problem for us includes audacity software but we did not need to load ithighly recommended !cfhi primarily use this as an usb adapter for my headphones so that i can connect convert the . mm headphone jack into my pc .the audio adapter is well built . it has a yellow led light that is solid when plugged into an usb port and blinks when there is a device that is connected to it through a . mm jack .installation was flawless . windows bit installed drivers immediately .no issues . no nonsense . simply works !this product has a mono microphone input and a stereo headphone output . it is meant for connecting a headset to a usb port . since the headset has a mono microphone this adapter works great . the drivers automatically install on microsoft operating systems . this product is great for using a soft phone or other communications program . the windows systems remembers volume settings each time it is connected . i imagine that you could use something other than a headset with this but it was mainly built for a headset . works seemless and great with a headset .
pro s . doesn t take up too much space . very easy to use . . very easy to empty . . can use regular trash bags saves money ! con s . there is a slight smell when my son delivers a really stinky muddy diaper . other than that there is no smell . i just throw the bombers in the trash outside .fyi . don t let it get too full otherwise it is hard to pull the trash bags out to empty . and once it is open stinky ! ! ! you don t want to waste any time getting the full bag out of the house .update our son is now . months old and it just stinks . no matter if there is a diaper in there or not . we have cleaned it sprayed it bleached it put dryer sheets in it well you name it and we have tried it . the thing stinks ! ! ! we have since tried other bags and such but if you walk in my sons room you smell the diaper champ . it is going out i am sad to say . but we did get several smell free months out of it . also just a note . my son started eating solid food and went to formula when it started stinking real bad !all diapers smell no matter what you put them in especially once your kid starts solid foods . get over it . this pail is fantastic . we use it for our dogs poop bags and line it with ruffies scented trash bags we use vanilla they also have lavender and they are cheap . there is no smell except in the summer when it is hot and that s only because the pail is outside on the back porch the one we buy for the nursery will be inside in the air conditioning .i have been using this product for four months and i can smell it . the reason i chose this garbage pail is because you can use whatever bags you like . i use biodegradable bags as well as biodegradable diapers and when the bag is to full the whole room starts to smell . now my sons poop doesn t smell yet as he is an exclusively breast fed baby . i just know from my experience that this diaper pail does not lock in odors and we now have to keep it outside of his room .
it doesn t make the giggling noises very easily i have to shake it hard to make it work . so when my dog is playing with it it is just another ball . . . . it s just okay .boy does this work ! we tried it out first to make sure it s not going to actually harm the cats . it s just like getting static shock . we accidentally step on it often when we put it in front of the kitchen and it s really not that big of a deal . . . well the cats don t get ontop of the recliner or go into the kitchen anymore . . . it just takes a time or two and the cats learn that they want nothing to do with it . i want to buy one more that fits in front of my tv to keep the kitty nose prints off of it .my cats use it just fine so i m happy that they re happy . the plastic door scratched easy but not a big deal . i like the in only out only locked or just open features . it would let the cold air in a bit with the cracks around the flap so i m using it in a frame that i had made to fit the door to slip into a side greenhouse window much like the bug screen does .i ll be able to take it out in the cold winter months when my cats don t go outside much anyway . for a simple inexpensive kitty door it works great .

my recent purchase of an aquaclear hob hang on back of tank filter will make this my th aquaclear . i have five aquaclear s three on guppy tanks and two kept as spares in the event of a breakdown . however in over a year of constant service i have yet to have an aquaclear hob filter s electric motor burn out .moreover one must take care to turn these filters off when you are using a sand substrate which is being stirred up in the tank since the sand can get into the motor and cause it to run roughly or seize up .even if this happens all it usually takes to get these motors running again is to remove them from the filter housing remove the impeller from the housing on the motor and clean the unit with water and a q tip .once you have done so the motor will usually begin to run properly again .i also own an aquaclear which i now keep on my gallon tank and an aquaclear which i use to filter a heavily planted long tank with about fish .so the extra filtering ability of the aquaclear is nice to have .as for the aquaclear this will be replacing the aquaclear which i used to filter my gallon tank and have now moved to my gallon .the aquaclear will be used in conjunction with a fluval canister filter for redundant filtration .the fluval like the aquaclear is another hagen product . it seems like virtually every product that is sold for the aquarist is manufactured by a subsidiary of hagen s .the is also a very cleverly designed filter which works quite well and is very easy to maintain thanks to fluval s patented aquastop feature the aquastop fitting allows you to disconnect the from its tubing without losing suction so that you don t have to reprime the unit once you ve dumped the water from its container during a filter change .all you do is reconnect the aquastop fitting to the top of the s canister and then open the flow valve until the fills with water .you must open the valve partially to avoid creating a tremendous amount of turbulance in your aquarium since if you open it all the way while filling the the air bubbles will race out of the s exhaust tube disturbing your fish .as for the controvery between which canister is best many people who consider the purchase of a fluval also consider buying an eheim and there are those who own both . the eheim fluval debate reminds this author of the chevy ford controversy regarding the merits of each .moreover i have owned both and find that fluval and eheim both make excellent canister filters . however the fluval s internal setup is much easier to use given the trays fluval includes to add filter media to while the eheim classic series i m not certain if the other eheim filters are the same way just stack the media atop one another making for a more complex arrangement since the eheim s filter media is in not in a tray .both filters are well made and reliable . however one must take care to re lubricate the fluval s o ring after each cleaning to ensure that it does not dry out since this will prevent the unit from leaking onto your floor . and careful removal of the impeller housing will ensure that the impeller that does not get damaged .after more than a year with the aquaclear series of filters as well as the several months with a fluval i must say that i am very pleased with these units . they are cleverly designed well constructed and should last for years provided that they are properly maintained .jimthis is my second tetra whisper air pump . the first one is still going strong aerating two gallon tanks . the second one will be on my gallon tank . i am sure it will produce the air i expect . this is a powerful little pump .i m currently running the xp with an aquaclear hob filter which is running in tandem to acquire beneficial bacteria in the xp and retire the aquaclear . this is on a g aquarium and it churns water rapidly . i did purchase poly floss for aquariums and that s above my biomedia . if you use the nitrazorb package that came with it . it will make your water crystal clear . without it not so much but way more clear than my aquaclear which is still eye pleasing .the filter is quiet too and setup is simple but you will need to lubricate the accessories that you will attach the tubes to they are thin plastic and you may end up bending an accessory due to excessive forcealso please note rena is now named filstar . it seems based on my research you got a spray bar when these were sold as rena units but when i received mine it was the new filstar which did not come with a spray bar . not a deal breaker but i wish it came with one to lessen the spray effect on the exit nozzle if you wanted to .
works great for my turtle tank perfect normal works well . cant go wrong . works great in my filter . a i have a few aggressive south and central american cichlid tanks and let me tell you if you cant keep a pleco alive this is the way to go ! this product works great . my only advice is that make sure you buy the correct mag float for the type of tank you have ie glass or acrylic .these bulb work really well at maintaining heat levels for your pets . good life on bulbs as well a must have .
this cover does not fit a full size acoustic electric hohner guitar . i measured the whole at but this cover does not even come close to fitting ! it measures in diameter so check your guitar closely !this is an ingenious clutch that engages when you step on your hi hat pedal but will drop to the closed position when you hit the lever on the top . this allows you to either ride closed hi hats when using both bass pedals yet return to normal hi hat playing when the music calls for it .be aware that this clutch has only two positions open and fully closed . however there is a way to work around this if you like partially open hi hats in the closed position for a sizzle sound . i did a work around by placing a spring on the hi hat stem with metal and felt washers on the top of the spring which gives me that opening when i drop the cymbal to closed . there was a lot of trial and error finding the right spring because each cymbal pair has a different height when mated together and i was looking for a tiny fraction of an inch opening . too small or low a tension a spring and stickwork chokes the sound . too large or stiff and you will not get the sound . however this is all personal preference and many drummers ride a fully closed hi hat anyway which makes this clutch perfect out of the box .regardless of your hi hat style if you are using a double bass this is a must have accessory . gibraltar s model is solid heavy duty and engages and disengages perfectly every time .this winder and cutter . . .winds and cuts fine . . .but the pin puller does not fit my guitar pins even though the ad claims that . . .it fits virtually all guitars banjos and mandolins . . . oh well . . .another lessson learned .
i found if i buried the wire the receiver collar wouldn t activate . the rest of the wire was above ground and worked as advertised .if you bury the wire it won t work if more than an inch of material is over it .i don t have enough room on my patio to use a screw post to attach to so i attached the ends to patio post with eye bolts . then i slipped a short leash handle on the cable so my dog can walk all around the patio .works good because i can work on stuff like the violin i am working on and have her with me . she can walk around my patio .the metal arms are solid so is the base but i don t know why the holes in the metal arms aren t pre drilled to accept the twist screws . it was also perplexing why the one arm was round instead of square at least the square arms have better grip traction for the crews . also mine came with no instructions and in general came very unprofessionally packed . for awhile i though i had gotten a used refurbished unit . also would be better if the wire loop hook on their deep dome lamp was wider to actually sit in the hook of the lamp stand rather then sit on top of it .
this is a great product for fall or winter babies if you live in a cold climate . it does away with bulky snowsuits which are inconvenient as well as unsafe . this is easy to use with any infant car seat . it allows baby to stay warm when needed and unzips easily when he she does not without disturbing him her . a must have for any cold weather baby ! ! !does what it s supposed to do . i only wish it had sleeves so that baby wouldn t have to wear pjs underneath . . . overall tho it keeps him warm and cozy .has worked well for me . still need a hat during cold weather but otherwise works for basic back and forth travel . not really good for extended trips outside in cold weather w o coat and hat .
the specifications state x . x . inches . with the wheels it measures . in height . of course it will not slide into my pantry at that height .now i either place it outside in an unsightly plain view position or drag it in and out of the pantry . i will bet in a few months that the unit breaks after pushing and pulling since the plastic is sort of brittle . the corners of the wheels are flimsy and not engineered well enough for the added stress of daily maneuvering where the wheels attach to the unit .seriously pass this if you are on the bubble of a decision .works like a charm ! easy to set up and put together . instructions are easy to read . i like how i can adjust the amount of flow very useful !this thing is amazing . you can adjust the height the angle the distance into the tank etc . etc .it holds up my super huge mercury vapor bulb with ease and has little brackets to secure the wire with .i have so far purchased . this is one product where zoo med really got it right .
do yourself a huge favor and use a mass flow maf senor cleaner to clean the maf sensor . don t use carburetor fuel injector or throttle body cleaner or you ll ruin the maf sensor .i required an ammonia free window cleaner for my tinted windows . this does the job quite nicely . it isn t how well it does rather how safely it does it .you ll never go back to conventional wipers after these . smooth no chattering wipes clean without streaking and very easy to install . note no snow where i live so i don t know how they perform in cold climates
long . x and solid .not your typical x box the fellowes boxes are heavy have reinforced holes where they are tied shut a plastic pull out handle on one end and the usual holes on both sides for lifting . straight for stacking that xtra length sure is welcomed !perfect for magazines comics documents and easy to fold together .this is an excellent basic binder . it s a usable medium size with slightly stiff round rings and a handy fold out front cover . the cover is an inoffensive shade of white . a sheet of thin clear plastic is wrapped all the way around the outside providing slots to slip in a full sheet of title cover paper at both front and back plus a strip of paper to label the spine . likewise a strip of the same plastic extends all the way around the inside to about a third of the height of the binder . this provides front and back slots to slip in a sheet or two of paper that you haven t gotten around to punching . i buy such binders six or so at a time .described as part of the sustainable forestry initiative these are letter size pressboard office folders . the spine expandable to is reinforced with tape billed as tyvek . the folder has a metal paper fastener inserted through perforations on both front and back about a half inch down from the top . there is a slightly smaller inner cardboard folder permanently attached to the outer folder also reinforced along the spine . this inner folder which functions as a pair of dividers also has a metal fastener attached to the top of both sides of each divider for a total of six fasteners . a two hole punch is useful to make the most of the fasteners .the index tabs on the outer folders are all in roughly the center position . the inner dividers also have tabs one at the middle position and the other at the lower position .these folders are neat in appearance strong and useful for storing and organizing paperwork whether or not you want to punch holes and use the fasteners . they are much less bulky than a three ring binder and keep things orderly . the different bright colors make it fast and easy to grab the one you need .
it works ! this guitar support couldn t be simpler . the neck rest is a molded plastic cup with that soft spongy material inside the neck support . the mat is a thick light weight foam mat a bit like a yoga mat with a hole cut in it . the neck support cup goes through that hole . that s it for set up . the mat protects the guitar body . the support cup holds the guitar at exactly the right angle to work on it change strings adjust the truss rod work on the pickups or clean the guitar . the guitar can be placed in strings up or down .this wouldn t be a difficult diy project but i d be missing out on that cool fender logo if i made this out of wood and a yoga mat . honestly this looks really sharp put together .the whole thing comes packaged in a clear plastic tube . that tube is an excellent storage tube .like many here the case could be an inch bigger . for my ibanez i cut the bottom material along the edge against the side wall enough to take out the bottom foam and then put the material back . now mine closes without pressure on the bridge .honest for cost it s star but i got and handle was slightly mismolded rubber groove is a little off . . . but in no way matters . just kinda ok really now i can tell them apart by feel .this is a nice heavy cordura like military spec heavy with self repairing zippers standard kind and totally adequate pad soft nylon lined and bonus pockets . . . . nice build pvc piping on pocket edges adequate pad backpack straps for any acoustic weight . heavy rubber feet for standing it up give a of wet ground protection if needed .for the price of many other brands i got and for what most folks expect they are great .
i haven t even installed these yet but they re windshield wipers . how complicated can they be ? i m assuming that when i turn them on they will clear the windshield . mainly i want to clear them from the list of items i have to review .i tried to sum it up in the title this paint is tough applies easily and covered more calipers than i needed it to . i painted front and rear calipers to a trans am . these are reasonable large calipers fronts have large pistons and the rear pistons are smaller to give you an idea of the size . i originally painted all calipers at once and still had a little bit of paint left in the can that i thought i d save for touch up . stoneauto company sent me two drivers side calipers and i didn t figure it out till i installed them . so i had to use the remainder of the can to paint a th caliper and it did it ! unlike other brands where there s nothing but air when the can gets close to empty vht dupli color impress me every time with their never ending paint cans . and there s still a little more left in the can !i also used the recommendedvht sp primerfirst i dusted my calipers with coats of primer then followed it with dusting of the black and one last heavy coat each coat spaced minutes apart . i ve maybe used the can of primer .i use jb weld for everything and it rarely if ever disappoints .i had a problem with people stealing the mirrors off one of my motorcycles so i jb welded them to the bars . fixed !i had a lamp harp with a broken threaded fitting so i jb welded it back on and it works perfectly !i had door stoppers that kept falling off so i jb welded them and they re solid now !i ve used jb weld for at least other fixes and i love the stuff .
i have mine attached to one of the support arms on myon stage ks xx pro double x keyboard stand . while this attachment is designed for both square and round tube supports i was unable to use it with anon stage tier folding z keyboard standeven with the top tier removed . the reasons for the problem with the latter stand is the friction fitting on the attachment bar was too small for the oblong support tube and had it mated the height of the attachment bar would not have cleared the top of the keyboard .when attached to theon stage ks xx pro double x keyboard standwith anon stage msa tb adjustable microphone boom blackattached to the top screw in post that perfectly mates with the boom this attachment bar boom combination easily clears the height of either keyboard i use aroland rd nx digital stage pianoor aroland v combo key stage keyboard .bottom line make sure your stand can accommodate this attachment bar according to the manufacturer it will work with most x style stands and carefully measure the height of the top of your keyboard from the center of the support arm to which this attachment bar will be inserted . the total height of the attachment bar after insertion is approximately . . if your keyboard is still too high for the attachment bar boom or other mic holder to clear you can gain an additional with ashure a x mic mount extension tube .it works well as a standard clutch as a drop clutch its very iffy . the top part spins around when you hit the lever so you have to grab it and move it back so you can hit it again .at sitting on top angled down to pick up my acoustic . would need a heavier base for use with a boom .
this cover does not fit a full size acoustic electric hohner guitar . i measured the whole at but this cover does not even come close to fitting ! it measures in diameter so check your guitar closely !used this to replace a dead volume pot in an older strat type guitar and it sounds great ! the diameter of the threaded portion was a little larger than the original chinese pot so i needed a cheap reamer purchased through amazon to enlarge the pickguard hole . it s a nice smooth pot with no scratchiness . nice big lugs to solder to .other than that when you need rack screws these are the real mccoy . wide enough pan to grab the ear narrow enough to clear that next piece of gear ! thanks raxxess !
i like this tub it fits in my sink well it folds up nicely . my daughter is months old and still fits in it .this pillow is well constructed but just too large . we have a king mattress and it just took up too much of the space .we really loved this . my son is almost two months old and he still fits in it . at first we were worried about not being able to use it . some reviews said that you have to use two separate duvets one for you and one for your spouse if you put it in the middle because you don t want your duvet to cover the baby . we were confused by this because the duvet didn t even reach the foot of this sleeper . we pushed it up all the way to the headboard of our bed . it took up the length of our pillows and we just slept slightly further down on the bed my hubby is tall but it still worked . since we have a king sized bed it s pretty large so it fit everyone perfectly baby in the middle us on either side .
don t waste your money on fram filters . mann filters will not fail you if you plan on a long oil interval in excess of k miles .fit my e i perfectly . it also came with the correct o ring to seal the oil filter housing . just buy it already !toyota offers two oem air filter standard and high quality . i d place the fram filter somewhere in between those . if you re not up to removing your glove compartment you might want to have the dealer install an oem filter . on toyota s it s fairly simple to replace the cabin filter and it only takes a few minutes . this filter reduces the airflow so the fan has to work harder than it did with the standard oem filter . this is the first cabin filter replacement in years and my old filter wasn t that dirty . i don t drive on dirt roads so i don t need to change cabin air filters that often .paid . here . . . . . . . cheaper than wally world . i bought three as these work on my motorcycles . filters the dirt protect my engine .the classic purolator filter is way better than a fram more pleats of filter media imo .i m using these on a kawasaki ex ninja but the l will fit any kawasaki or honda motorcycle that uses a cartridge oil filter and has enough room these are approx . . inches in length . . . . .or you can use the l which is shorter . inches in length .why give your hard earned money for the oem filters which are made as cheaply as the motorcycle manufacturer can buy them and branded with their logo . . . . .crappy filters is what you get from the dealer . . . . . i want my stuff to last lol .
these discs work well with avent products . they also fit in my lansinoh bottles .this pump works well has pleanty of power comes with a cute and practical purse bag and since i use the playtex drop in bottles it was a great match . it also works with other bottles .these bottles are the best for switching between bottle and breast . my daughter hardly ever has to take a bottle but when she does she has no problem with these . she would try to inhale smaller nipples because they didn t have the broad base like the breast does and like these playtex nipples do . plus playtex now has a storage system for pumping into the liners . this set comes with an adapter to connect to the pump and some caps . you can also buy more caps . they make it so easy to store milk and then just pop it on the bottle . the adapter definitely works with the medela pumps . i think it will work with all except maybe avent .
this pencil is tiny which makes it not very comfortable to write with . i ended up giving it to my son who likes the way it looks . . .but he also noted that it s small in his hand he s a teenager so his hands are adult sized . maybe good for someone with small hands but not for us . dthis is a good pen it s the fatter type that is supposed to keep your hands from getting tired . shipper sent item quickly .excellent product ! this is one of the first electronic devices that gets my quot thumbs up ! quot within the first day of using it ! and it get addicting making labels for this thing here that thing there . fun and easy !excellent design very comfortable to hold in your hand with a good weight balance not too heavy not too light and good size . the buttons are not too small and the arrangement of the buttons are easily accessible and easy to learn .excellent accessories with different types of ink tapes and sizes ! very good printout of labels quick and no jamming ! and easy to cut . wonderful smoothness and professional look to the labels . good stickiness to objects too plastic metal leather paper waterproof as well .i would recommend this brother s has created a product that is affordably cheap and easy to use fun and reliable . nothing to complain !
i have one of these on each of my motorcycles so that i can keep them on battery tender battery chargers when parked . this is also a handy power lead for a v air pump .the fuse that comes stock in this harness is a bit weak for running an air pump . i ve had to put in slightly higher amperage fuses but i haven t encountered any problems with the higher amp fuses .i bought this to work with the master flow air pump . i have one and it never blew my fuse . i have been reading that some vehicles may have lower rated fuses in the accessory circuit . i tested this by connecting it to the battery and the pump ran just fine .i have a power bright pw which works well and the power bright specifications state these are very efficient units max . which is why i also tried this smaller unit for another need .this inverter is heavily built and on the outside seems like a quality unit . when first powered up using the accessory outlet adapter the unit ran my watt current draw okay . i then switched to a set of hd cables i use for the larger inverter which probably had nothing to do with this issue for another test with the same load and a few seconds later smoke and flames billowed out of the back for several seconds . the green ac power led in the front was still on and it may have been producing ac power but i was busy shutting down the test and did not verify .for the money this seemed like a great unit and it probably is . defects happen even to the best of items but i replaced it with a watt tripplight which will travel better for its intended usage .
hello i have been using velcro straps with ring clips on the ends to wrap large and small items . you pull the strap through the ring and cinch the velcro . but the problem with these types of straps is if the item is smaller than the length of the velcro area you have to wrap the strap several times to get the velcro to fit . now with this new one wrap velcro you can roll it tight around the cord to keep it attached to the cord . then you roll your rope or line and when you are finished the velcro attaches snugly everytime . if you have the original velcro tape with the male female sides attach the male sticky end on a surface and this product attaches easily . this is a great product . you can t go wrong with velcro .update april after finishing off that first roll of the velcro i ordered more . this product has a bazillion uses and i keep finding more . it is not the sticky back kind but it must wrap onto itself . transporting and carrying a long hose ? neat and tidy . keeping pvc pipes together ? excellent . finally placing rope lines anywhere you want is easy with this type of velcro . roll the rope wrap the velcro around once overlap and make a longer loop to whatever you want to attach the coiled rope . if the longer loop is reattached to the initial velcro that gives you a handy carrying handle for the rope . the product is outstanding and the delivery was superb . fuzzy wuzzy s summary highly recommended with warm fuzzies !i have used up many lengths and widths of these one wrap straps over the years and it is not because these straps break or get lost but because i just keep finding more and more uses for this . velcro straps previously came with separate hook only and loop only straps . these one wrap straps have the hooks on one side and the loops on the other side and are optimized for bundling wrapping purposes while still being easily flipped around for closure if you are routing these straps in more intricate arrangements . so you do not need to keep separate hook only and loop only straps . these straps are very durable even after years of use . they do not tear stretch or fray at the edges and both the hook and loop sides remain very sticky to each other after repeatedly attaching and detaching over the span of several years .these one wrap straps are my favorite brand and style of velcro strap . velcro also makes cinch straps that have plastic buckles so they are easier to cinch tightly and while they have their uses too the cinch straps are more expensive cannot have their lengths precisely cut to a specific length and really do not perform any better than these cut it yourself one wrap straps unless you really do need something tightly cinched together . so while i have several of the velcro cinch straps the bulk of my velcro applications come from using these one wrap straps and the adhesive backed industrial strength velcro tape . the industrial strength velcro tape is great for both indoor and outdoor mounting of objects that need to be removable . these one wrap straps also work great when used in conjunction with the velcro tape to serve as removable fasteners stick either the hook or loop side of the industrial strength velcro tape on a surface wrap the object that is to be secured fastened with this velcro one wrap and attach the one wrap to the velcro tape .here are just a few of the many ways that i have used this velcro one wrap electric cords extension cords computer cables garden hoses christmas tree lights and other rope like objects stay much more organized and untangled with a few sections of one wrap wrapped around them . when transporting bicycles on racks i use these to prevent the wheels pedals and handlebars from moving around . i sometimes use bungee cords for these functions but bungee cords sometimes cannot be looped around the handlebars to remain taut . i keep a small roll of one wrap in my hiking backpack and it has various uses during hiking and camping . these one wrap straps are great for wrapping around rolled up sleeping bags sleeping mats and yoga mats . i keep a small roll of one wrap in my photography backpack . i also used velcro to create a tripod holder for my camera holster bag which was not designed to hold a tripod . i attached two rectangles of velcro tape on the straight side of the camera holster bag and then i wrapped one layer of this velcro one wrap around the middle of the folded up travel sized compact tripod and another layer of one wrap is wrapped near the tripod legs . the tripod can then be attached to the velcro tape that is stuck to the side of the camera holster bag . i then wrap a third section of one wrap tightly around the tripod s head and loop that strap through the holster s d ring where the shoulder strap clips onto . detaching the tripod from the holster bag is a simple matter of quickly pulling open all three one wrap straps and i can now bring a tripod with my camera holster bag for outings where i do not care to bring the much larger camera backpack with me .i always keep some of this one wrap in my toolbox my hiking backpack my photography backpack and in the glove storage compartment of my car . the only limit to how to use this is your imagination from opening box to ready to use is only about mins nothing to do but attach the weighted legs and put on the movable elastic band that holds pages down .while a great idea this item is not designed well for all plastic construction imo .the only metal i can find is the threaded bolt on the adjustment knobs and what sounds like steel shot when you shake the base legs .the main plastic support for the books and it s adjustment point are very flimsy and it s a plastic to plastic contact area no matter how much pressure you put on the tightening knobs you can t stop the legs from flopping side to side by an inch either way . also slips down when you have heavier book on the stand .thought i must have them attached wrong but they are correct .maybe some masking tape under the clamps might close the gaps a bit and make it tighten up better .i would suggest that you never move it around with the legs attached as there is only a very small lip of plastic on the clear back board to keep it all together and when that snaps you will not be able to use that area again .plastic legs are make heavy by filling them with steel shot or bbs through a hold in the bottom and then sealed with a plastic plug pushed in then covered with one of the stick on foam feet .this could be a pretty nice item with the use of a bit of metal in the right places rather than plastic imo .
these bulbs work as described . the ks illuminate clear white for those who want no yellow or blue hues . they are definitely brighter than standard bulbs but keep in mind nothing will emulate hid brightness .they are nice bulbs but don t last near as long as factory bulbs and the headlights in a dodge ram are so poor that not even these bright bulbs help . i had to mount off road lights to use with my high beams to take care of the problem . i m sure these bulbs are fine for other vehicles but there s no hope for factory ram headlights .i have a jeep wrangler tj rubicon and this is perfect for converting the regular headlights bulbs to aftermarket hid bulbs . the fit is perfect and with the hid bulbs it s extremely bright . in fact it s so bright i am concerned i might get stopped by the cops tip stay with w hid bulbs and don t get the w hid bulbs .highly recommend .
rena filstar xp is perfect for my new gallon aquarium ! this filter cleans up the tank . it was very super easy to start up and prime ! i use two different rena filstar filters i use xp for my gallon and xp for my gallon aquariums !i recommend rena filstar filters for aquariums as they are very easy to set up and maintain !love this filter system for my fish tanks and will always use this product in the filter system at my house .i purchased this filter for my gallon freshwater tank and it s doing a great job . the water is beautifully clear and the filter is very quiet .
we have a large unfenced yard and now my dog is able to run and play .she learned the limit of the run right away . . . . .she is so happy to be out inthe yard but you have to watch the cord doesn t tangle around your feetthey run quickly around you and will make you fall . . . .my rabbit throws this around his cage like crazy . he absolutely loves playing with it . he even runs back and forth through the cage throwing it !my cat is enjoying these plastic caps remind me of the ring around the milk cap . she loves to carry them around and slip them under things .
works just like it needs to . perfect fit for the tailgate on my chevy when the oem clip busted .they do work . exactly as advertised . hane no fear on buying these . fit the chevy silverado wt tailgate rods .fit my nissan frontier s oil pan perfectly . looks to be of nice quality . torque to ft lbs on the frontier anyway 
very versatile power supply and much cheaper than others . this is not true isolated outputs but it is quiet and that is what counts . i have the fuel tank chameleon and i end up using this because it fits the needs of the pedals on my board the best mainly because of the ma output . here is a comparison of the jp chameleon and the onespot . i have all three .t rex fuel tank chameleon ma outputs v v maoutput v v maoutput v v ma use or only not bothoutput v ac majoyo sp ma outputs v maoutput dc v maximum output of maoutput dc v maoutput dc v mavisual sound onespot ma v only daisy chain power into pedals not exceeding mathis device is a converter that works with rca inputs and outputs . the input seems to be geared for the db range for consumer level audio range . this box also has the ability to monitor the input directly with headphones .plugged it in and it powered my rode nt condenser mic . i was delighted .
if you take care of a stray cat around your home or an old animal with joint pains i highly recommend this product ! can be used indoor or outdoor . outdoor suggestions under a blanket or fleece out of the rain . stays warm for at least hours depending on the weather .all you have to do is microwave it and put it back in it s fleece pouch !great product ! ! ! !we were looking at the glass door inserts but not only do they not allow your sliding door to lock but they are hundreds of dollars . since our only goal was a way to let our cats in and keep the flies out during the day we were leaving our screen door open for them this seemed like a perfect alternative .it was easy to install i do suggest leaving a little more screen then they suggest when you are doing the cutout and works great for letting them in and out .a couple of items about it to help you make your decision if you live where there are alot of mosquitoes or gnats they will be able to fit btwn the cracks in the unit . you will have to close the glass door to keep them out . works great for areas like ours in ca where we just have to worry about flys and wasps .i recommend installing it in the middle of the door . when i lock the cat door they paw at it if they want to go out and it can get rough on the screen . we installed it in the middle of the door and so we can just close the glass door halfway to keep them from pawing at it .i got this to use when taking my puppy to the beach so he can go further out in the water and i can stay dry but it s great for everyday walks also .
fair price and does what it s supposed to do . it s handy for when you don t want to work directly at the car .works great but make noise which is to be expected because the way it is designed to work .does exactly what it s supposed to do fit low and snug on the filter cover . to work with good tools can make the task a miserable experience or a sense of accomplishment .recommended for sure !
ordered of the qt for lb bags of dog food . it says it will hold lb but the lb barely fits . i saw a review that said they put in lbs i don t know how . nice container with a lid that flips up on one side snaps shut .i could only fit about pounds of dog food in the quart size without the bag . different kibbles weigh differently so just keep that in mind when ordering so you can get the right size . i can fit a pound bag of taste of the wild in easily but the pound bag was too big even though i had already poured about of the bag out .the container holds a . lb bag of science diet indoor cat chow with about inches to spare . the label says it hold lbs of cat chow but i do not see how that is possible . the wheels are nice and the seal is tight .
this tub definitely has it s advantages and disadvantages . the sling feature for a newborn is great . it s soft and supportive for your newborn and makes it easy to give your baby a sponge bath while you re waiting for the umbilical stump to fall off . that s pretty much all i like about it . now let me tell you about what i don t like . . . . it fits on any kitchen sink but if you want to give your baby a bath in the bathroom you re going to find yourself bending over the tub just as you would if you gave your baby a bath in the big tub . i have the oval shaped bathroom sinks and there s no way to sit this tub on the sink surface with any stability because one of the edges will always slip into the sink . if they had made the bottom flat despite the curvature of the top this problem would have been avoided . . like other reviewers have mentioned once your baby is big enough for the reclined side but not yet big enough for the upright side your baby will slip down over the hump that is supposed to hold him in place . not only does this look uncomfortable but it makes it hard to keep your baby s face from sliding in the water once they re big enough to roll and kick but not big enough to sit up . . washing your baby s privates is a nightmare . i have to get my son to stand in the tub while holding one arm so i can wash his privates with my other hand . this wouldn t be so bad in the big people tub where the surface is flat but the hump in this tub gets in the way where he can t stand with as much stability so he s constantly slipping . they didn t put the non slip surface on the entire base of the tub just on one side of the base . and it would have to be the narrower side where there isn t room for both of his feet . they could have solved my complaint and if they had just put the nonslip surface on the whole base .maybe complaint will be better once he s big enough to sit up but complaint and are always going to be issues . i recommend this tub for infants and possibly for toddlers but not for babies between the two stages . i am planning on purchasing a bath sling to use until he s big enough for the upright side of this tub .this is an excellent tub for an infant . pros the little sling that attaches to it is perfect for the sponge baths you will need to give your newborn while his her belly button stub is still attached . i filled the tub with just enough warm water so that when i placed the sling over it my baby s bottom would be submerged to keep him warm . after he was able to get full baths the rubber padding on the newborn side helped keep him from sliding down or to the side . cons the infant toddler seat on the opposite side is a little awkward . my baby out grew the bathtub at four months and he is a little baby in the th percentile . i seriously doubt that any toddler can fit in it .i loved this tub while my twin girls were small enough to use the mesh .however when they grew too big for the mesh they used the slant side which was a problem because it s flat vs concave and the girls would slide from side to side since there was nothing to keep them in place . i would have to roll up a towel to keep them from sliding to the side having their head shoulder wedged uncomfortably against the side .also if the water level is high enough to keep the babies warm their butts tended to float up and over the seat area which makes them slide down into the water . i had to keep a hand on their bottoms the whole time to keep them from sliding down .when they were old enough to use the sitting up side i loved this tub once more . the notch on this side kept my babies safe secure . the babies loved sitting up splashing in their tub .i just gave this tub away since my girls can sit up in the big tub now . i probably should have kept it for travel but too late now . overall i am not quite happy with this tub for the above reasons . i listed some other pros and cons below pros this works well with our under mount kitchen sink with a divider in the middle . this tub has a notch on one side to accommodate sink dividers which is nice because it keeps the tub stable and angles the tub toward the center of the sink which is key for not having tub overflow all over your kitchen counter .the plug changing color if the water is too hot is a nice feature though kind of silly because who wouldn t test the water with a hand ? it doesn t turn color until the water is already too hot for me let alone a baby and it s way at the bottom so if the tub was full you wouldn t be able to see the plug well at all .the mesh sling is nice dries well and is very easily adjustable and supportive of baby .cons potential con if you have a drop in sink with a rim such as our bathroom sink is this tub will not sit over it .the inclined seat back is flat rather than concave so that baby can slide from side to side and get stuck with her head against the wall .
the size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous . the funnel is long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only long . it states that the funnel is x but in reality the opening for the funnel is in diameter at the widest point .it would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless .we received these and they work very well . make sure that you measure the distance between the wheels and the size of the wheel because there are two different sizes . they work much better than wheel chocks .would recommend getting a size smaller than what the sizing chart recommends as i measure aroun my leg as recommended and the chaps were one size too large . . otherwise they are awesome quality and build
this cover does not fit a full size acoustic electric hohner guitar . i measured the whole at but this cover does not even come close to fitting ! it measures in diameter so check your guitar closely !this is a great value . i contacted the company for measurements inside the case to see if it would fit an ibanez rg series . it fits perfectly . thank youit fit my american vintage s strat . my guitar had an hole pickguard . i ordered an hole pickguard and it fit like a glove .the guitar is ply plastic black white black . this is what most black fender genuine replacement pickguards will look like .i am happy with the purchase .
 like this dog bone but a bit too small for a very large dog i recommend the largest size if you have big dogs or heavy chewing dogs .my lbs lab mix loved this bone ! perfect size for him to chew on . definitely would recommend this to others !i have large dogs all over lbs and one lb rat terrier mix mutt . the product is great but bad price ! i can buy for at walmart .
i didn t think my great dane or hound mix would like a bone made of nylon but surprisingly they both enjoy it . it is is a good size for the hound pounds but the dane could use something bigger unfortunately i think this is the biggest size .i have large dogs all over lbs and one lb rat terrier mix mutt . the product is great but bad price ! i can buy for at walmart .this is my car safety harness of choice for all three of my dogs . i have a lb mixed bichon lb mini poodle and a lb mini poodle and they all wear size small . they are quite adjustable and work well an extension bought separately so the dogs can stand or lay down with comfort in the back seat of the car . without the extension only my short legged mixed bichon would be comfortable . the poodles have longer legs and would not be comfortable without an extension . tip because they all wear the same size harness but at different adjustments i have a little piece of yarn in different colors for each tied onto the harness so i know at a glance which harness belongs to which dog .
love the launcher coming with rubber balls not tennis balls included . great color for finding when flung . and the dogs love the bounce and the feel in their mouths .this works great my only wish was that it wasn t a fuzzy pick up dirt kind of ball . i thought they shipped balls like are in the separate packs .very nice sand for my reef tank . it does not look overpoweringly pink but has more like pink undertones which is exactly what i wanted .
compared side by side with known accurate thermometers and this one was almost right on the dot accurate . happy camper .hard to mess up a floating square . it does contain the food .negatives . . . .to me at least the post that attaches it to the side is long . this puts it far from the corner .overall size float size is l x w . pretty large .inside float dimensions are approx . l x w .this ring could be reduced by a third or half . the foam material does support algae and is quite visible unless you keep the water level up to the black trim .i m used to a simple x clear plastic ring with trapped air floats . this type stays in the corner with the surface tension of the water .all in all i ll use it but wouldn t buy another due to the size .based on reading many reviews i assume the deminsions listed for this product are incorrect . amazon you must change according to many people it is a flat matt not inches thick as lsited in the dimensions x x inches .
this gate has been great for the doorway to a room that we are in and out of constantly . i initially purchased thesummer infant sure and secure extra tall walk thru gate white but i had trouble with the latch staying closed not something you want with an ambitious baby around ! sure it is more difficult to step over this gate but it will never come unlocked to allow a child to break loose . it is easy to take down anytime you need with one hand easy to carry around and the plastic does not mar the door frame or paint on the wall i lean it against for storage when not in use . the gate can be left on the door frame when the door is closed .for us the summer infant door will not close with the gate up lever handle not a knob on the door so for naptime and bedtime the gate had to be taken off . this involves unscrewing all four pressure mount posts using two hands to carry the gate one on the door part one on the frame and finding a place to put it where the metal would not damage walls or furniture . i think it would be more appropriate for a place where removal was not often necessary . and the noise ! a baby grabbing the bars and shaking can make quite a racket !we brought it for the space between kitchen and dinning room . we didn t want to drill any holes therefore we choose this . it clearly said can be hardware or pressure mounted . yes they are correct if you are not planning on using the door function to this gate . if you plan on opening the door part it will release pressure of the side of the gate . therefore you need to remount the gate . i m not feet but only a petite person and it will be hard if i just climb across .bottom line it s misleading when they said it can be pressure mounted ! please note if you are using the door it will release the pressure mount side .these locks are awesome . we slid them into the folding spots on my preschooler s closet doors . the photo is misleading and makes it look like they lock in the middle between the doors but they actually slide into place where the doors fold so make sure to order two .
these converters worked perfectly with my medela swing breast pump and my medela pump in style . i loved not having to transfer milk from one bottle to another .i purchased these so that i could pump directly from a medea pump to my avent bottles and it works perfectly .i had a medela single electric pump and therefore only had one shield . my sister let me borrow her double electric pump in style so i needed another shield . this works perfectly . i already had the tubing that i needed with the pump in style . i m glad i didn t have to buy a whole replacement set to use the borrowed pump .
this is the staple of my cockatiel s diet . i ve tried many other pellets including other zupreem flavors but when it comes down to it they always prefer this size this flavor they go to it every time . recommend .i hate to disagree with the majority of reviewers but there is something about this brand which we recently tried . it seems to upset my dog s stomach and she doesn t like it . i thought maybe there was something wrong with this bottle of product so i tried another bottle purchased elsewhere with the same result . and i tried using a smaller dose . quite perplexed as my dog does fine with other brands but not this one . guess we will stick with the other brands .my cats barely seem to notice this treatment and it seams to sting less than other similar treatments i have used . i have found it effective for up to three weeks the first two applications and now after having used it consistently for almost a year i have found that the cats need a new treatment every weeks .this advantage works much better than other products i have tried .
works great . fairly easy swap . just be aware the front window regulators are the same on whether you have a suburban or tahoe or one of their gm family members . not so for the rear regulators . the full size suvs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones . the vehicle input feature amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference . the pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at but the vehicle id feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit . beware ! ! ! ! just so you know the dorman and fit the full size and the and fit the tahoe size vehicles .highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering suspension work . you will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover .i hate to use the pickle fork . the pickle fork is the last resort for me as it will damage the balljoint boot .i prefer to use the snap on balljoint remover . if that one cannot fit then i will try this tool . if this tool will not fit then i will resort to a pickle fork .the product works very well based upon condition of your interior . it will not make your car new but it does work . hope this helps .
another toy my dog killed off in record time . as soon as the squeaker dies my dogs interest dies . why can t they make better squeakers ? ? ? ? ? ? ?our dog will fetch these but if she catches a glimpse of one of the other types of chuckit balls the rubbery ones she will totally lose interest and only wants the rubbery one . must feel better in her mouth . they also wont wear out like this one does they only ever have to be replaced due to losing them . the tennis ball sheds its fibers and will wear out with time .these tend to break due to presure and it replaced my bad one on the fluval . as will all fluval parts treat them nicely and they will last a long time .
well it s oil i m sure how one can rate this . well i can say it is in a nice bottle .while i like the way these pens write i don t like how long the ink takes to dry and how freely the ink flows .i like the fact that the amazon prices for color ink cartridges aren t nearly as high as the cost i get for one at a store near my house . you save dollars buying one off amazon !they usually last about months before the color begins to run out . it depends how often i feel like printing pictures . i like how easy it is to slide a cartridge in and out of the printer . you have to be careful not to be too jerky with it gently push the ink cartridge in and test it out with a scrap piece of paper the first time to make sure it works correctly .
i decided to try these pens after being sent a couple of them with something else i bought . i loved them and decided to try a pack of all the colors . they work well and the colors are great ! i can use the colors on different subjects when i file things and it will make items easier to spot . there is a free case included but be careful opening the plastic so you don t ruin the case . also the . is the line size i like as i am not a fan of the real tiny lines on some of the pens .i purchased one of these as a holder for my school supplies . i love it so much i think i might buy another one for my textbooks . the book ends i bought were junk . also perfect for the price ! you really get what you pay for .and that is the quote of the delivery guy but these boxes are in fact very generous in size . i couldn t decide whether i wanted the type with a lid or the this type with the string button closure but finally decided on the latter because i was afraid i would lose the lid like i ve done with all of my other bankers boxes .i used these to organize old financial records i m able fit about years worth in each box ! as well as using one as place to store all of my sewing patterns craft recipes idea books papers etc . so it s all together in one handy box but organized into sections inside .i ve also used one to sort out anything important to our household like warranties product manuals receipts for purchases of big items car repair maintenance records birth certificate and passport copies etc .if i had a hundred of these i could find a different uses for them . they re very durable roomy stay shut securely but still easy to open and are a very good value .
this issue with this bad boy is not quality features or design . this is a pedaltrain product and just like my pedaltrain this is a well made perfectly designed board that does exactly what it claims it will do it holds freaking pounds of guitar effects stuff . and that my friends is the problem .i am using a voodoo labs x power supply but had to also get a tripplite isobar outlet power strip that i drilled into the upper left corner to handle a couple of the extra pedals . i plug that into the wall and then use a homemade iec power plug in the voodoo . on the pedal i was able to fit jim dunlop volume pedals one is for the looper a crybaby wah tc electronic flashback x sparkbooster mojo mojo overdrive corona chorus hall of fame reverb ditto looper and the shaker vibrato . i also have the mxr flanger helicon harmony pedal for vocals a korg tuner and an electro harmonix pulsar tremolo . i know i know . did i mention this sucker is big ? i feel like they should name it the pedal porch . maybe i can put a few potted plants on it .so getting back to the question of whether or not you should get this behemoth i will ask you to ask yourself do i really need all these pedals ? if the answer is hell yes i deserve them all ! i worked hard for them and can now make awesome sounds ! ! then by all means knock yourself out . just don t get a hernia lugging it around and make sure you book venues with appropriate stage space . no joke .i recently purchased a vox mini g modeling amp to go with my new mainland tenor acoustic electric ukulele . it was my first electric instrument and i immediately fell in love with the combination uke amp .a little time went by and i began wishing i could plug my other non electric ukuleles and guitars into my amp . i see diy pickup sets are pretty inexpensive but i didn t really want the expense times eight or the hassle of drilling holes and installing them on all those instruments .then i stumbled on this cherub pickup . for about the cost of lunch at mcdonalds it seemed i might electrify on the fly whatever instrument i cared to . . . pickup . so i bought it .bottom line is that it works very well for my needs . and although i don t have a very critical ear i think i can hear a slight quality clarity difference between the built in pickup on my mainland uke vs clipping this onto my other instruments but that s not a surprise and such a small difference that i don t much care . so far i ve been clipping it into the sound holes but i might try it on the headstock as others have recommended .if you re a rock god don t even consider this why would you anyway ? . but if you re a mere mortal just having some fun with your instruments and would like an inexpensive option to plug one in once in a while this cherub is for you .this is my first mixer . i d been looking for a cheap way to upgrade from usb powered mics like the blue snowball to something a little more professional and of course that requires a mixer with these kinds of hookups .thus i am an amateur and you ll probably get more accurate ratings out of a professional .anyway my pros and conspros . this thing is way smaller than i expected . i can hold it in one hand without any difficulty and that means it doesn t take up a lot of desk space . it fits well where i put it . . it works as intended . i use this with a gls es mic and this mixer is powerful enough to power it and make it sound good . i have my windows volume set at and the gain is up at about . i have no hissing and no problems . i did a podcast with this set up today and my podcast co host we do it over skype said i sounded very clear and my voice sounded strong and good . this is a stark improvement over the blue snowball . . it s plug and play . i plugged it in it installed the drivers and it automatically set itself as the default microphone . easy peasy . . i use reaper as my audio software and reaper recognized it immediately . . the dials and everything was easy to understand .cons . you can t plug this into a usb hub or even an ac powered usb hub otherwise you ll get a hiss . this needs to be plugged directly into a computer . . this high jacks your audio defaults in windows . to fix it open your control panel open the sound and set your playback device to your speakers to fix the problem . your sound will come out through your speakers as intended . since i use this as my main mic i left it as default in the sound settings .overall for the price this is an amazing little mixer for beginners and amateurs . i know there are better options but they are also more expensive and i m on a budget . it s a great way to get into the world of sound without spending a lot more money . if you re like me and a single person doing youtube video voice overs or podcasts this is perfect for a home studio set up where you only need one person . worth every penny as long as it lasts . i ll update when if it breaks down but until then i do not regret this purchase .
used bottles of this before . will keep the blades of the shredder well lubed and sharp . makes it much easier on the shredder motor .excellent quality . very sharp blade so definitely watch your fingers . blade is straight and cuts cleanly . a must have for anyone needing to trim cards or photos .i use my westcott paper trimmer mostly for cutting down sheets of paper for use in my day planner . this type of job doesn t require that the paper be completely even so this trimmer is perfect for my needs . the scoring feature is nice and allows you to check before making a cut and the titanium cutting blade is sharp enough for most household needs . i tried cutting a manila folder in half and it worked fine . i also like the swing out ruler which allows one to measure paper before cutting .i do have two problems with the trimmer . first the metal plates on the cutting surface and ruler have obviously been glued to the plastic base and the glue is visible around the edges . it makes the trimmer look cheap and somewhat dirty looking i keep thinking that it needs to be cleaned . second and more importantly the trimming blade is on the outside edge of the trimmer handle leaving it exposed when lifting the paper holder . i already almost cut myself my finger came into contact with the blade . i have another westcott cutter and the blade is in the middle of the trimmer handle so it is not exposed unless you put your finger in the gap in the paper holder . overall though for the price i think this trimmer is a good product .
this is a really nice card making kit . the card stock is very heavy and a nice texture . it s easy to format and includes envelopes . i do think the large envelopes would need extra postage if you are mailing them .these are nice sturdy cards and envelopes that print up very nice and crisp . they are not photo cards but a slightly shiny card stock they fold so easily on the fold mark fit the envelopes nicely and no extra postage required . i used microsoft digital image suite to make my cards and it works perfectly with these i used pictures of my pets to make christmas cards and they turned out rather nice . these are not fancy cards but are nice enough to send out to others .i really like this card stock as it is scored making folding the cards easy and precise . it has a nice heavy weight and the ink is absorbed evenly for good looking cards .
bought these because we were using a medela pump and philips bottles . of course the breast pump and bottle industry can t make it easy for everything to work together . these adapters fit great onto the pump and the philips bottles . don t feel forced to buy all new bottles or a brand new pump just to make your system work !these converters worked perfectly with my medela swing breast pump and my medela pump in style . i loved not having to transfer milk from one bottle to another .i purchased these so that i could pump directly from a medea pump to my avent bottles and it works perfectly .
my akita loves these ! i was buying a oz container at petco for around . . oz before i found the oz here for . . oz . best of all they are made in usa and full of vitamins . we cut some of the larger chunks in half to make these last a little longer . on our second batch from amazon now .each . oz bottle ml treats gallons . directions are drops per gallon or one capful ml for gallons . i prefer this product over another water conditioner because it gives directions to treat each gallon helpful for smaller betta tanks or partial water changes in other small tanks .this is the second one of these i have bought . they hold just the right amount about a lb bag are airtight and they stack .
does it all . perfect for cleaning and waxing guitar don t need a bunch of different items this does it all .does what it is suppose to do . what can you say about a tool . if it works properly and it does what more can you say .this compact humidifier is easily filled with an included plastic syringe . if you don t over fill it will not drip and you can simply place it in your case instead of the usual sponge .
this product does what it is designed to do very very well . it is not used very often but when it is it works beautifully .works great for what it is designed fordoes not work for all guitars . one of my guitars has a more rounded head and it does not fit over that anyway i have tried . though with the arrow shaped holders it works as it should
toby our lb pup got too old to get in and out of the suv on his own . the petstep saved the day . easy to deploy easy to fold and stow . you will crush your fingers once while folding it up but only once . sorta like a child and a hot stove . live and learn . i don t really see any way to redesign the edge to avoid this without making the petstep more difficult to use . by the rd day i was able to deploy it from the back of the suv in about seconds and stow it in about seconds .from a dog psychology standpoint i found that even after using it for a year toby still wanted to leap off the ramp when he got halfway down . and his legs were not able to handle that so i had to lead him down the ramp by holding his collar so he wouldn t try to jump off . in the end it was prostate cancer that did him in . the petstep is now stored in the garage and i m sure we ll be using it again as soon as lucy gets too old to jump in and out of the suv on her own . but she s only so she has a few more good years i think .okay this perch completely and totally changed my relationship with my bird for the better . when we first got conner the conure a green cheek conure with the pineapple mutation he was a sweet bird but he was a little nippy and very independent . he liked tickles on his head and neck but when he was done and had enough he d bite with no warning . he wasn t a cuddler or anything like that either . this was hard for me since all the birds i ve had when growing up were all very cuddly and sweet . in fact all birds i ve known are cuddly sweet like that at least some of the time .i loved conner my conure and he was fun and full of personality but he just wasn t very friendly over all . he wouldn t stay sitting on my shoulder or anyone s for very long wouldn t let us tickle his neck for long nothing . affection was available but only in short bouts before he d bite and then fly back to his cage .then i bought this perch for him . and i put it on the outside of his cage so that he hung over my shoulder while i sat in the recliner and did my routine . i work from home and usually sit in my recliner when i m working and now his cage beside me i d let him out and work . this rope perch was right over my shoulder the whole time i was working . i d basically ignore him and he d eventually come down and walk out on the perch and sit over my shoulder . he say watcha doing ? and i d talk to him . he liked to watch my computer screen especially when i played candy crush with all the bright colors but you know i was ahem usually working ! and in just a couple of weeks he went from a standoffish independent birdie who didn t interact much with us to a bird who came straight to his rope perch the minute i let him out . so i started rubbing his neck and scratching his pinfeathers when he was on the perch and he would come and sit as close to me as he could while on the perch . in just a couple of more weeks he was leaning against my head when he would get tired and was sleeping on me like that .today he sleeps in my hand cuddles with me all the time comes and lays in my hand if i put it up on the perch next to him . he gives kisses and asks for tickle tickles on his neck . he hasn t bitten anyone in months and months now .using this perch to let him be close to me but not actually feel trapped by me let him get used to being around me and slowly we learned how to interact with each other . i can now literally turn him upside down in my hand cuddle with him on my chest or under my hair you name it . he s the sweetest funniest bird .and his rope perch is still right there on his cage and he sits on it right by me all day long while i m working . i plan to get a couple more of these so i can put some perches up in the bathroom . i want to see if he can get used to taking a shower with me now . i ve heard birds like that sometimes because it s like bathing in the rain for them . we ll see if it works . also i thin his little feet like the softer surface of the rope perch as a change for the little talons sometimes .the rope is stiff but wiggly enough to position however you want . it s held up well . i do have to turn it over every now and then cause it will start to droop downward at the part near the connectors but flipping it over will fix that right up until it starts to droop again then just flip it again .a good quality product and very safe for birdies and works great with the cage . note this doesn t have the suction cups for using on walls or glass windows mirrors . this has a plastic screw on connector that s mostly made for connecting inside cages .i have young parakeets and bought the large perch for them . at first i thought it might be too big but far from it . they adore this thing and crawl up and down it constantly . it is bendable so i have it snaking down to the floor of a very large cage and they traipse up and down this like a ladder all day long . also they love to fly off of it and land . apparently the extra large footing gives them the security they need to make a safe landing and they go all day long doing this . if i had more room i would buy a second perch as the birds really love it .
the diper depot works well with our prince lionheart whipe warmer . it s ridgid plastic construction makes it a stable platform as compaired to the soft vinyl organizers . my only whish is that the hinges on the lid of the diper dispenser could be made a little sturdier .keeps my beautiful tan napa leather nice and clean . blends in nicely too . it is made of very sturdy and water proof material . i highly recommend this for people with toddlers who love to snack in the car . clean up is a breeze .we are very happy with the tub . it is light well made made in the usa ! thank you ! ! ! we buy a fair share of made in china stuff so it is nice to see a made in the usa product . the drain in the bottom is a great idea as well .
it works but my only gripe is that the hardener should be double the size as it takes x the amount to properly cure this stuff in my experience which makes the difference between dirt hard and rock hard .my last bottle of wax was mothers california gold . to be honest i can t tell any difference between that and the nufinish either in applying it or the end result . both are great .dropped right in and made a noticeable difference . went from about mpg to about mpg highway . the plus is its also reusable .
this pillow is bigger and fuller than my boppy pillow . i agree with the other posters that said that it would be nice if the cover came off for washing but i have just followed the recommendation of another reviewer and put a receiving blanket under my baby s head when he s nursing . the strap that goes around the baby velcros to the underside of the pillow so it can be difficult to get the velcro in place without jostling the baby . all in all i prefer this pillow to my boppy just because it s a bigger pillow so it positions the baby better for nursing . also one reviewer noted that the pillow didn t fit around her . i have no problems with fit and i am a size pre pregnancy . i would definitely recommend this pillow .i purchased this item over the boppy pillow because of the velcro seat wrap . it keeps my baby in place without him sliding downwards which i have witnessed with other babies using the boppy pillow . boppy pillow covers can used with this leachco pillow . when my baby is too big for the velcro seat wrap i will be using boppy pillow covers on this pillow . the lack of the removable cover is a disadvantage for cleaning purposes .it looks thin and soft on some photos but it s pretty thick which is good since it gives a good head support and wraps around my legs and behind my back for better support .it s long enough for my height so that was a big plus .this pillow does take a lot of space on a queen size bed and you d think it ll support your belly but the belly stays on the side . .i thought it was b c my belly was small at the time but i m now weeks and it doesn t support it . . .it can t go on top of the pillow like some photos seem to show b c the pillow s too high in that area . .so i bought yet another pillow a small wedge pillow . .i ve recently added a standard pillow under for head support b c of heartburn and i ve had extra pillows for my feet b c they are almost always swollen .although it s not a husband replacer like the salesperson called it and you do need more than this pillow to sleep comfortably overall it works good for a body pillow . .i thought it would be the only pillow i d need so that was a little disappointing . .and for the price almost it d be nice to include an extra cover . mine came with the pillow and a white cover .
i bought mine march and it s august and it no longer works . the remote with very fresh batteries will turn the music on but you have to shut it off manually . the music is annoying so leaving it on after the baby has gone to sleep can drive you nuts . i did really like it at first though . it takes some adjusting and it does tend to move around .this helps from letting my daughter play with the actual outlet and plug in but she can still pull the cord out of the plug in the inside . so it does protect her from being electified but she can still unplug the tv lolwhat a pain to to remove the cover and does not fit some plug types . only the smallest plugs will work like lamp plugs not not thick cords like computer plugs . xbox ps etc are out of of the question . you can replace computer cables with thinner lower grade cables to get around this .
when i bought this the product title was not so explicit that it was one solid piece shield connector . therefore you can t customize your shield size and i find it more difficult to clean than two separate pieces and bulkier to store as well . however it does work with my pump i just wish you could take the top apart .i like these much better than the two piece design . easier to clean and keep track of parts . bought enough to last me two days so i can allow one set enough time to dry while i use the other set .i recently purchased this yard when my twins now nearly months old started to become mobile .i have yet to baby gate my entire house but i have super yard ed the family room ! i have it shaped as a square and have those alphabet puzzle peice foam squares inside to protect my carpet . the boys enjoy being able to actually see through the holes and be able to play with many of their toys rather than being confined in a pack n play . it is pretty sturdy if used properly i mean if i or any other adult were to fall on it obviously it would collapse . it does fold but not at all compactly and i would say that it would most likely take up my entire mini van trunk if i were to travel with it . . . so if you are looking for a compact on the go type of play yard look else where . i do like that you can configure it to fit an oddly shaped play area or even remove add panels sold separately which we did not buy to make it larger or smaller . also due to it being plastic very well rounded i may add no sharp edges ! we will be able to start bringing it outdoors as well now that the weather is improving !i also am planning on purchasing another one to use to gate off over sized entrance ways to my family room . my husband believes if we screw hooks with the full hole not the hole to either side of each door frame and then attatch those strong zip ties to the hooks and the holes in the gate that it will work . of course this will do damage to our walls but it is the only solution i see fit with such a large doorway please note that these are not meant for stairs or doorways . they are not baby gates . . . this is just a creative suggestion i thought i would mention . and one of my friends owns one and used it to surround her christmas tree last year which i thought was an amazing idea !i think that once our boys master crawling and eventually walking that the super yard will prove even more valuable than it is now !
i used it to refill my aluminum pen that also accepts gel space pen it is cheaper than the space pen refills but i think it is not as good asi have the two fine and one extra fine vista pens in demonstrator clear and black . i switched to fountain pens from gel ink disposables because i wanted a less wasteful writing option . i journal a great deal and went through boxes of regular pens very quickly .the clear barrel on the demonstrator is great because i can see when it s time to refill the cartridge . i also like the weight of this pen not made of cheap flimsy plastic . the solid colored plastic barrels look very plain though . if i get a colored fountain pen next time i d go for the lacquered or metallic exterior .i use noodler s heart of darkness ink a very nice black shade but the extra fine nib clogs and skips with this ink . however it works great with the fine nib vista pens .i tried using the converter but the lamy cartridges have larger capacity so i can go longer between refills . i fill the empty cartridges using an ink syringe can be found on amazon also . i purchased a pack lamy ink cartridge set here on amazon lamy makes decent ink also and just reuse refill those whenever they run empty .my favorite writing pen . . highly recommended .i did not buy this from amazon just a local store but i did buy it based on the good reviews on amazon . for me writing with this pen is not very smooth also there are times when the ink does not come out at consistently . i no longer want to use this pen at all because of it .
very quick and easy mounting and really adds to the look of the rear of the jeep . these are metal and not a cheap plastic and mount with included screws into the existing lens cover screw holes .it bothers me when front license plate is screwed directly to the bumper . considering the cost of these mounting brackets i wish manufacturers included them as standard equipment it would show their attention to detail .when i found cruiser accessories mounting plate it seemed like a good value . i especially liked multiple slots for mounting onto the bumper . these slots provide a good number of mounting and adjustment options . i used the upper two vertical slots because they were spaced exactly like the existing holes in my car s front bumper .unfortunately there was a couple of frustrating issues that spoiled the experience . four screws that are included with the plate are too long . i saw them being long and i am glad i checked for this before installing the mounting plate onto the front bumper . i used included four screws to attach the license plate and the black cruiser accessories classic lite frame to the mounting plate screws sharp tips protruded from the back of the mounting plate . if i had installed the mounting plate onto the bumper first and then tried to attach the license plate with the included screws i would have damaged the front bumper in two places the bottom two holes ended up over an air intake slot on my car . i expect all pieces included with the product to be carefully engineered for that product and working properly . these screws obviously are of the wrong size . the fact that i had to go to home depot to find properly fitting screws not only was frustrating but also increased the overall cost . . the thin pieces of plastic at the top and bottom of the mounting plate are too flimsy . when i unpacked the plate these areas of the mounting plate were slightly deformed bent inwards . fortunately the license plate covered the problem .when the mounting plate is installed it looks nice so i am not completely disappointed however i found a similar product from bell at autozone and it was cheaper though bell s mounting plate had very long screws too .this is a product is made of high quality fasteners and nuts and includes the hex key wrench for installation . great valuie .
most manufacturers use a variation of lubricant similar to atf to insure smooth shifting even when the transmission is cold . they also rarely specify a change interval . if you want the best lubricant for your manual transmission mtl is it . it requires a slow hand on frigid days but will insure the transmission will last the life of the vehicle .this is a great item . works well . indicator lights let you know the status of the battery . very pleased with this battery tender .works great with my amp alternator and watt amp . i absolutely do not run the stereo sub amp without the engine running so the battery should last quite a while . arrived in perfect condition with adequate packaging . stars unless it dies in an unreasonable amount of time at which point i ll update my review if it comes to that .update more than year with this battery and it still works flawlessly despite having been in a couple serious accidents . this battery is a champ .
i like avery poducts . these are no exception . high quality and perform as expected . it should be obvious from the size but these are not the biggest labels . if you are going to be printing out a lot of labels in bigger font like say for wedding invitations then i would choose a bigger label . i m not comfortable with inkjet generated labels since they are susceptible to water dissolving the ink . . . for important letters i like to stick with laser printed ones or use ballpoint pen .i think these labels are a very good all purpose label not just for an inkjet printer as you can use these by hand too .not only to label file folders or to label cd cases but i would also use these for just about anything i want to label like when i buy something in bulk and freeze it . i always like to label what the item is as well as when i froze it .these labels look white but when you peel them off they are clear . you can use either a pen or marker on them .the label size is ample so you can write what you need to on it . i have some labels just like this but they are white . i think i prefer these clear labels .i did find them alittle hard to see where one label ends and another one begins . i like that they come in a pack of . i doubt i will have to buy anymore of this size label in my lifetime .iam very happy with these labels .i love sakura s gelly pens . i ve been using them since the fad of dark paper got started . by the way where did all that dark paper go ? i wish i d bought up all the black notebook paper i could get my hands on ! ahem back to the subject . these moonlight gelly pens by sakura are very freeflowing have a medium point and as advertised on the package act like paint pens on most surfaces . five of the ten colors are regular pens with intense vivid ink in different shades including a wonderful blue and a teal green that s very hard to find . the other five colors are what i d call neon but they aren t described that way . the package lists these five colors as glow under black light . i haven t got access to blacklight type lights so i can t comment on how the pens perform when exposed to it . however these neon shades are just as vivid and intense as the others and offer a nice lighter color contrast to the first five pens . i have used these to detail some celtic type designs on the title page of a book i own and have used them in various coloring type books as well as writing with them . unless you are scrapbooking it would be a waste to just write with this set of pens . they work so wonderfully as paint pens i m saving them for exactly that . the flow is excellent easy control quick drying don t smudge for at least seconds to be safe when all wet looking areas are gone the ink is dry waterproof etc . the ink in these pens creates a slightly raised feel very subtle though when the ink is dry on paper . i haven t tried them on other surfaces though several are listed on the package as suggestions . i have a feeling i ll be ordering these again in the near future . i love the metallic sparkle and other effects . i m on the lookout for some swirl type milky gel pens as hard to find as black paper ! but these moonlight pens are an excellent addition to my pen collection ! i ve ordered from this seller several times in the last years and have been impressed with the professionalism speed of delivery quality of product and packaging every time ! go ahead and try these pens you won t be disappointed .

i read some of the reviews and that people almost had to guess what strings were what . however on the bag that it comes with to prevent corrosion and on the box itself have a color coded guide saying what string is what color on the nut . the strings themselves are the normal color for strings .i read the reviews on ernie ball strings . i have to say that i love the strings . they have a rich sound that brings my acoustic alive .strings are not just strings . guitar strings are another very important part of playing great guitar . and all martin products are second to none .
the small e string and the g string both broke on the ball end while tuning . i haven t broke a string while tuning in years never ever had one break on the ball end .luckily i bought the three pack .but i can t recommend this product .i ve been playing guitar for about years and within the last year bought my first taylor guitar taylor guitars ce ltd grand auditorium acoustic electric guitar . it came with these elixir strings on it from the factory . i am blown away by the brightness and purity of the tone these strings produce . what s even better is how long they last .i m pretty hard on my strings . i usedunlop standard tortex picks pack purple . mmwhich are very stiff and chew up strings very quickly . the nanoweb wrap that they put on these string makes them last several months instead of weeks . they re a little bit more expensive then other major string brands . but after about a year of listening to these only gone through sets so far they re worth the extra few bucks .i play a cordoba classical and these strings are the best i ve found for it . the bass strings really resound all strings stretch and hold within three days and they last longer than i ve expected for classical strings . i ve not yet had a broken string with them .
it is hard to find a printer that lists windows server as a compatible operating system . i tried some other brand printers and the drivers would refuse to install . even though canon support told me that this printer is not officially supported for server i installed the drivers anyway and it works perfect !december update the most recent release of the driver utility software now works with current versions of outlook and microsoft mail for vista users . still no thunderbird support but they made progress . . .good points easy install and set up . the software applications authored by other companies photoshop elements bbyy sprint ocr and presto bizcard are decent to excellent . very high quality tiff scanning of photos . quieter than any other scanner i ve owned this is . fast direct to pdf scanning from a front panel button . decent old scratched dusty photo repair capability . relatively speedy processing .bad points the epson provided software is generally functional enough but has some goofy quirks . major major major flaw under windows xp the front panel email button and its associated attach to email comonent of the epson creativity suite supports only outlook express outlook and outlook . if you use outlook mozilla or thunderbird this button and the application are simply non functional . there is simply no excuse for such a limited set of supported email applications . epson should be ashamed of itself . worse still this limitation is buried in the program s read me text file and not addressed anyhwere in the html help files . front panel buttons should be widely supported ! the file saving location settings are not persistent and the full automatic professional and home modes have some very non intuitive options for many features and for saving multiple configurations . documentation issues . there is a printed setup poster . everything else is in html files .overall a fine piece of harwdare with excellent output . strong affiliate second party software . not so strong epson software .excellent printer terrible software .the included editing software is barely usable . you cannot cut and paste text from another application into your labels .text will usually printout lower than what a shown in the editor . a job that looks perfect on your display using print preview will look different when actually printed . be prepared for lots of wasted tape .i have the latest software from brother . c which only shows compatibility with older obsolete operating systems .if you want to use the printer stand alone you will probably be happy . the included editing software reminds me of mac os or windows . 
do not look at the weight ranges when deciding on a size . my son is at the top end of the size large weight range but this item will still fit him for many months . instead look at the height ranges for a more accurate size determination . my tall son is growing out of size month clothing but the size large sleepsack size months will fit him for many more months .it s larger than i expected but i will keep it until my son can fit into it . my son is lbs and around inches which is why i bought the large based on the weight recommendation but even the medium is quite large on him right now . would suggest using the height recommendation as a closer indicator of what size to buy rather than weight .i ordered packages in order to cover the appropriate circumference of coffee table and the front edges of two end tables . when the package arrived the length of edging was not as advertised . that means i was completely short and could not complete my project . aside from the lack of length the product works well and seems secure . i would have ordered more had i known about the length . it s quite a disparity between and so purchase appropriately .
i was so excited to get this for my yo and it is a great toy . . . my yo yo love it . but it has an issue with batteries ! when it arrived with included batteries in a try me box the batteries were dead . it s not being played with at a rate that warrants having to change the batteries once or twice a week . when it begins getting low on power the music sounds warped like an old warped record which is dreadful ! perhaps we got a defective one . i don t know . i hope this isn t happening to others .many different choices of sound . does not run on batteries plug in only . i had half of the sounds stop working after years and using it for all of my son s naps and bedtime . i phoned the company and they sent a new one no questions asked .i got it for my year old son . he likes to push the buttons and listen to the music . it s sturdy . he s thrown it a few times already and it bounced off the hardwood and still works fine .my only qualm with it is that it sounds like the batteries are dying . some of the music just isn t the greatest sounding . now he doesn t care but as a parent who gets to listen to this for seemingly hours when it s his toy of interest it becomes grating . i changed out the batteries and it sounded the same . given that i know this i also know that he loves playing with it and that outweighs my feelings . i d get it again in a heartbeat if we ever lost this !

if you want to increase the amount of gain and distortion in your tube amp drop one of these in the v position the tube closest to the input jack of your amplifier . easy to do and you ll notice an immediate increase in distortion .placed one in a fender blues junior . before when the master was down and the pre amp volume was all the way up i could barely get some overdrive . afterwards it had plenty . night and day difference .good sound too . . . not harsh adds harmonics . very lush sounding . tung sol knows how to do it .let me start of by saying this tuner is great .my previous tuner was a korg ca and frankly that tuner is terrible .the main differences between sat and the ca sat has a build in light ca does not .ca has a build in stand at the back to prop it up to a deg angle sat does not .sat has a auto and manual mode ca has auto .sat displays the octave of the note e .g . e e etc ca displays only displays the alphabet e for all oactaves .sat has a numerical display for the cents off ca does not .what made me get a new tuner is how finicky the ca when using the build in mic . the needle on the graph just jumps all over the place from the harmonics of the guitar and that has nothing to do the sensitivity or accuracy of the tuner . yes it is accurate but so are many of the tuners out there that do not have such a poor usability . another issue with the ca is the poor screen . the screen is so dark and only viewable head on .the ca does not have any of the flaws of the ca and is even more accurate .what this tuner has accuracy usability durability versatility . what more can you ask from a tuner of this price ?the fender vibro champ is a great little amp . i m amazed at how good this amp sounds . a small light weight package with a good set of voices that outputs a decent amount of sound .this is a watt tube amp with enough power to fill a medium sized room or the perfect practice amp . this is a much better and louder amp than the small solid state starter practice amps by all the major manufacturers . fender uses two very standard tubes for pre and amplification ax and v both are fender branded tubes . these are nice clean tubes that react consistently .the amp takes about seconds to warm up and draws watts .the cool part of this amp is the voice settings . in reality the amp packs effects for different amps tweed blackface british hot rod metal jazz and acoustic . the first five have three different levels of style each . our other two amps are marshalls an acoustic and a half stack . if i m being really honest i like the sound of this amp a lot more than the half stack . this is a clean simple amp to use . the marshall has a ton of tweaks that are hard to get exactly right .the volume level on the different voices is nowhere near matched . some voices are incredibly loud others are really quiet . switching voices means moving that volume knob a lot . sadly the volume only goes to .once the voice is selected there are effects settings possible with two or three level for each vibratone delay reverb chorus and tremolo . the f x level knob adjusts the amount of the effect applied set to the effect isn t used at all . this is probably the least useful part of the amp . there is no pedal selection so once the effect is selected and volume dialed in you re kind of stuck with that until you fiddle with the amp again . there s no easy way to change the effect in the middle of a song .there is a gain knob .i like the speaker on this amp . it is nicely detailed with a good warm sound . the internal speaker is connected with a inch jack so it is possible to connect the amp up to another cabinet with a simple inch speaker cable . very nicely done fender most cheaper amps are hard wired to the speaker . the back panel also has a inch jack line out .this is a great small gig or practice amp . the sound is outstanding . the amp is used with a gibson lucille and a les paul standard plus .
this curt manufacturing in . hitch lock works great so far . i have not had any issues with it yet .i didn t know this was what was already on my car when i bought another to replace it . when removing the existing one i found moisture had made its way into the components inside under the cap . i would take an educated guess that it was due to an inferior o ring or bad vent cap . there was some oxidation on various parts and even some rust which i ve never seen in any other vehicles i ve owned over the past yrs . the matching rotor was a pita to remove which i will explain in the rotor review . i won t buy this or the rotor again .this is the only product that i have ever used on the soft touch interiors on the vws and audi that i have owned . i have never had a problem with peeling and probably never will as long as i use this to clean the itnerior . has a pleasant smell and works really well !
these work well for a budget level . they have double sided tape on the back and a couple of drill holes for security . the problem is that if you only use the tape they can move simply by grabbing them and wiggling them around . the onyl way to truly secure them is to drill holes . i did not want to drill holes in my rv in the event that i didn t like these or wanted to go with something else in the future .if you do get them i would buy a couple packs of them so that if they break or go bad you can put a new one in without chancing them being unavilable and potentially having to get something else that doesn t have the same screw hole pattern .i love lynx products these caps fit properly and do what they are supposed to do . i would buy again .i m sure this product will do what it needs to do . it s difficult for this product to really screw up what it s intended purpose is . i use it to put on spark plugs and wheel lug nuts so they don t seize up and become impossible to remove .
nicely made and fits my hjc cl helmet perfectly . for cold weather use you might want some type of anti fog insert also .while designed for marine applications where the fuel sits for extended periods i use it to protect my kw rv generator when in storage .though amazon stated this cap would not fit my ford e chassis for a jayco class c greyhawk rv i ordered it anyway as it fits many other years of ford trucks and looks the same . it is rare for the same vehcle to change a design like that . it in fact fits perfectly . our rv gas filler has no cover not that that is a deterrant and gallons is a target for remote theft of gas or a target for vandalism . this cap fits well . i have not been able to fit the stock cap retainer onto it yet . i understand these modern vehicles have anti siphon plugs but one can still end up with foreign substances in the exposed fill tube . this is a good ounce of prevention .highly recommended .
this potty is simple tough and great for a boy . helps keep the pee in and won t kill his bits if he gets caught on it while sitting . it is easy for a child to take the bowl out empty it into the toilet and put the bowl back into the frame .this pad helps the carseat stay in place not slide on the leather seats . it also protects my seat from the inevitable crumbs that fall so they are not rubbing on my seats .easy to install .i do not use the toy pocket they are small and hard to get something in out of but not needed either so i didn t mark my score down .i definitely wholeheartedly recommend the baby bjorn toilet seat reducer .this seat is contoured in a way that makes it comfortable to sit on and boy s pee goes into the toilet .there is a kind of dial thing at the back that you turn to make the seat fit snugly and securely onto your toilet so it does not shift when your little one is on it .the handle at the back means you can hang it on a little hook if you wanted to stick one of those removable m hooks to your wall .i also give bonus points for the colour white without a licensed tv character in sight 
my dog is obsessed with these balls and the launcher . they have a great bounce and last a pretty long time if you don t let the dog chew too much .they would probably be too big for the smallest dogs though diam . my dog is pounds and they are on the big size for her .my dog adores her chuck it launcher and i like not having to touch the slobbery balls .i didn t realize how thick this rope toy was going to be when i ordered it . it is a great toy for a big dog like a lab or german shepherd or bigger . my dogs are not quite that big and this was a bit heavy for them to carry around or play tug of war with . i also had to cut off the fringe on the ends because my dogs will eat it . i am donating this to my granddog who is a labrador retriever and it will be the perfect size for her . it appears to be pretty sturdy but with dogs like mine who eat all their toys eventually who knows ? ?it works ok for my poodle cat and long haired dog . it is not easy to clean if my long hair dog has rolled in the dirt .
this pedal has been on the market for a very long time and it was a smoking deal for a boss pedal at . the pedal works great with almost any guitar pickup set but sings with my emg powered schecter and tube amp .different distortion levels can be dialed in and to my surprise it works good with a bass although bass players know they will lose some bottom end .the guitar universe always raves about boss and the distortion pedals and how any guitar player should have one of the distortion pedals . buy it and experiment with the gain and settings and find your favorite tone .i may buy another one and mod it to use with my bass .the fender mini electric guitar stand is not made for the fender squire mini guitar . the guitar falls through . i will have to buy a differant stand for him rendering this one useless . the fender stand for standard guitars will not work on the size ether .nice reverb pedal got rid of my boss reverb . the tc pedals are all that is on byboard except my wah and a phase if they made these pedals i d probablybe all tc electronics ! what else can i say ! ! ! !

this would be a very good litter trapping mat if you could wash it . i had mine a few days and was liking it . . . when one of my cats overshot the box and urine went on the carpet . i checked all over the packaging of the carpet there we no washing instructions . i put it in the washing machine because i really did not think that hand washing was going to get it clean . the result the backing came off of this mat . . . leaving me with a washing machine full of this horrible grey gritty substance that used to be the backing of the carpet . i don t particularly want to own a product that is made to be used around a litter box that is not machine washable . that is too much work when i already have enough to do with multiple cats and several litter boxes . if you want a mat that you have to wash gently in the bathtub or take outside and hose off with soap and water and air dry then buy this mat . . . otherwise save your money ! ! i think i ll use the one i have in the garage for something . . . until it finds its final resting place in a landfill this dish is too deep for cats but what really annoyed me was the minutes i spent trying to get the label off . i tried peeling it off using soap and water then goo gone and then goof off . i scraped and rubbed and there is still a ton of adhesive stuck to the side of the frame . now there s cat hair stuck to the adhesive . lastly when you lift the feeder up you have to make sure you hold it by the frame otherwise the bowls pop out onto the floor . i threw it in the trash after about a week .i used this to clean my foot bird cage . i used a few sprays and a paper towel and everything wiped away easily .
i uses this on a workshop door that has a fairly aggressive automatic door closer . the stop holds the door firmly open .when in the kicked up position the stop holds in place and doesn t have a tendency to drop down .whenever i have a study group at my house it drives me bonkers to have to demonstrate everything on a piece of paper . this easel style whiteboard is stupid easy to set up . it comes assembled already . all you do is adjust the height to where you want it and tighten the knobs so it stays put . then it stays exactly where you put it until you re ready to adjust it again . you can write on both sides . both top and bottom have the little marker holding tray on it . the legs spread out so that the easel stays nice and stable on the ground . this makes life so much easier to study because everything is right there .these boxes were fairly simple to out together and then had a very sturdy feel to them .i placed hardcover books on top of one of these boxes and it held up without a problem .the only negative is that the ink rubbed off onto my skin as i was folding and pressing the flaps into their slots . the tabs need to be pushed down firmly into place in order to achieve full sturdiness so that they will not come out of place .use disposable gloves .
these three packs are not available at my local pet shop and if you compare cost it s an easy decision ! these are the same foams that come with the ac when you purchase the filter .direct replacement suction cups made short work of rehanging the return hose . product came as stated and was cheaper than i could find in local pet store .these cartridges are expensive at my local fish store . the amazon price is a good value . i have not found any good alternatives to the original marineland cartridges .
greatgood choice good toy well made my three love it so they each have to have one . it s pretty good for puppies as well .we got the stegosaurus and it is great . cool design and good for our dog that is a strong chewer .
great ! lightweight easy to store easy to open can be packed in a suitcase left at grandma s house . tray can be a little snug since there is no way of making adjustments to it . but then again if you child is big enough they can just push up to the actual table .it latches onto the breakfast counter or table tightly and is nicely padded . very handy for a picnic with a little one or a trip somewhere when you don t want to drag along a high chair . takes up very little space as it folds up !i picked this storage box up after exhausting myself trying to find an easy to maneuver and safe toy box for my toddler s toys without spending a fortune canvas bins baskets with liners etc . . it is not an heirloom wooden toy box but really serves the purpose and looks better in our living room than a rubbermaid bin or a series of open top baskets . it is roomy has a soft lid that you can either use closed or tuck behind . the sides have mesh pockets for books and the tote bag fits into one side after putting in divider . the sides and divider that velcros inside to divide into sections would probably bend if the baby smashed into them stood on them etc . but the plus side for me is that she cannot turn it into a stepladder because it is somewhat pliable . for the price it cannot be beat and provides good temporary toy storage .
i use it everyday primarily for a storage cover . i have not had the cover on the bike in rain or weather . i got the xl for my cbr r with full large rear bags and windshield . i can lock my helmet to the rear seat area put the cover on and it will cover up the entire bikes exhaust and of the rear tire and entire front tire . two bungies mid bike and front tire enable hokking cover under bike . very sturdy and breathable with exhaust panels silver durable material and inner windshield liner . much bang for the buck . would certainly purchase another if i had to without question .i was originally going to get one of the small squares to go behind my newly installed speakers but after comparing the price per square foot i decided to tackle a box of this stuff . a box let me cover four doors and my roof in my subaru wrx wagon .this car is my first non mercedes in years and although the subaru is still an econo box this made the stereo sound way better reduced road noise and give the car a more luxury feel . well worth the price and effort to install .i use this on the back window of my jeep grand cherokee . it does not flex enough to have full contact on the window . it only has about of contact . i will not purchase this again .
they stack inside of each other and also stack as a tower .they have holes in the bottom to prevent suction . the number of holes and the shape side counts match the numbers on the cups . so has three triangle holes has four square holes etc .i bought this white cover model upc code on label x dm bb andsafety st power strip coverto compare the two . unlike that item this cover is not expandable . its dimensions are fixed at length wide and high except for the at the power strip cord end which is only high . the slot where the cords for the equipment come out is wide and long . when closed the hole for the power strip cord is by . there are no holes for wall mounting but four outlet covers two plastic cable ties and ten cord identifier stickers are provided .to open the cover at the power strip cord end you pull up on a single tab this seems rather easy for a child to disengage which means that he she might have access to the outlet nearest the power strip cord end . to open the main cover you pry open three tabs then open the unit like a clamshell .the plastic is softer but probably more resistant to breakage compared with the safety st model . i like the fact that you can simply open the cover to flick the power strip switch on and off . it is narrower and shorter than the safety st model by about in either direction which may prevent using wider strips or transformers more than about high with it .buy this from amazon .com ! btw about the amazon photo the interior is actually white i don t know what produced that egg yolk yellow color inside . i installed two of these in about an hour . it would have been easier with two people the hole punchers included aren t great but the get the job done . the guard covered most of my railing from the base up to about an inch from the top rail . if you are going to cover a long section ft it can be difficult to get the full length to stay flat . what i did was punch a hole along the top every feet and used a zip tie pulled through the hole over the top rail to hang the sheet of plastic making sure the sheet was level and pulled tight horizontally . then i went to the bottom and every third vertical pole i punched a hole on either side of the pole as far in as the hole punch would reach and zip tied the sheet to the pole . then i cut the top zip ties and slid the plastic sheet down so that it rested level on the bottom and punched holes along the top a the same intervals at the bottom . two holes every third pole and zip tied around the pole . they supply plenty of zip ties so you can afford to make a few mistakes . the plastic is stiff but not so stiff that it breaks . the babies haven t defeated it yet .
this is so perfect in so many ways he can watch tv he can play i can breastfeed him or just take a nappy with me . love it ! i have used avent nipples for all of my kids . they are a great product at a great price on amazon especially if you can get the free shipping !these are perfect when your milk supply is not as great . very economical and they come in a mesh bag so they don t get lost in the washer .
will only pump air about inches under water then the pressure becomes too much .batteries are loose so if you shake it it will turn on and off .very short power feet max if not feet cord makes it obnoxious to set up on a fish tank . has a clip on the back that will not fit on anything you d have on our around your aquarium so difficult to mount or put anywhere .it does what it is supposed to do though which is turn on when the power goes out . i have mine so the tube is inch under water so itll break surface tension in the case of power outage . very cheaply does what it says it will .my husband sprained his wrist so i was in charge of trying to put this into the ground on our camping trip . it had rained the night before so the dirt on the ground was reasonably soft . i tried to screw the stake into the dirt but it just wouldn t stay . i put all my weight into it and it just kind of grazed the top . the top handle doesn t have any sort of comfort just a piece of metal . so unless you have a strong grip i do not this doesn t work very well . if it had screwed into the ground i m sure it would have held up since the metal seemed to be very sturdy .anyone with a tank should have one of these even if it s just a ten gallon ! this tool removes the need to haul around heavy buckets of water and makes water changes so easy that you won t have to muster up the motivation to do one . especially handy for people with back problems !this thing is pretty well built the plastic parts are good quality and the hose is thick and sturdy . there s a handy on off valve close to the gravel siphon so that you can get your water to the right temp and make it to the tank without having to kink the hose or anything .i d like to note that it will fit on a bathroom faucet as well without a trip to a hardware store for some kind of adapter you just have to take off the aerator on the faucet . the plastic nozzle thing is not too long so it doesn t hit the bottom of a bathroom sink . . .in my sink there s about inches of clearance but since it s a bathroom sink and not a kitchen sink when i do my water changes i keep an eye on the sink just in case there s a clog or the sink doesn t drain fast enough .you will never regret buying one of these . 
i was excited with how easy it was to set up and it makes my music room look so much better with guitars hanging up instead of just sitting on the floor or on standscomes with all the velcro you can need very simple to set up even for me a newbie i got the voodoo lab pedal power to go along with it although you have to drill holes into the pedalboad to mount it its pretty simple .not easy to set up hard to tighten down . works well enough as a filter once you get it placed .
the string winder with a string cutter and pin puller is an excellent design . it will be very useful when installing new guitar strings with all of the items needed for the job .my only issue is the shipping charges for such a small item . the shipping cost were almost as high as the cost of the item itself making the purchase of this item an unfavorable purchase price for a single item . if you need an additional item on an order from this seller you need to check the shipping cost or you will not be getting the good price advertised for the item and may consider purchasing it elsewhere .i do some guitar repair work and one of my customers needed a lp case . i have bought a lot of stuff here on az so looked at this one and had it shipped to him . he says its great so that is my review .prices are always great on az and prime saves me money in shipping . stars is my tops anywhere .these strings sell for about half the price than the store so it worth the effort and wait to order these from amazon .the strings came very quickly and are of very good quality .
the picture shows a box however my pads came in a plastic wrap . i prefer the box since it can double as storage and dispenser .these are just the right size and are clean when they arrive in the package unlike some that will sometimes have charcoal loose in the package .these pads are for my penguin filter box . i priced these same pads at the local stores and this is by far the best price around . they came in a nice box for storage .
these are not cheap filmy protectors nor are they super heavy industrial type mil protectors either . they are easy to load and very non glare although be forewarned they appear opaque and non glare free until loaded then they are crystal clear and easy to read through . for most home and business uses these are near perfect sheet protectors at a reasonable cost while providing good quality .these labels are excellent clear .pros sticky but easily removable labels are lightweight and thin labels look sleek high qualitycons labels are a bit delicate price is highif you are in need of clear labels these are a great option !these are well made sheet protectors they look frosted but this is the non glare . . . something i appreciate . . . it doesn t interfere with legibility at all . they are archival grade and feel sturdy . all in all an excellent product intended for heavy use documents etc .
fits my john deere lawn tractor which is model la and likely it fits all the l la and d series lower end john deere tractors . please post a comment if it does not and i ll update this reviewcurrently amazon says it does not fit my third generation miata nc but it doesthese filters come top in most online filter tests and i use them in almost all my carsinexpensive yet works as good as the ones sold by honda dealerships . made true to specs and fits right into the slot on my accord .will buy again .they do work . exactly as advertised . hane no fear on buying these . fit the chevy silverado wt tailgate rods .
with so many vehicles i needed to replace my year old unit . this uses dual power so at home i can plug into ac on the road the volt plug in my car . i like the auto shut off feature when pressure achieved .this is heay gauge and heavy duty !i use this to connect up to my cca diehard marine battery .with the battery tender cigarette socket installed i then plug in my arb cooler load up and head out .with the pre installed a fuse it won t fail never does !solidly built adapter . allows me to plug my trailer into the garage when using the lights charging the batteries or cooling the fridge . a must have for the rver .
i purchased of these blitz lavender and cream colored bins at petsmart years ago . i use them for dry dog food . i was pleased to find a matching one on amazon as i now have more to store . i subscribe to amazon premium dry dog foods which is both a great bargain and convenience . yes some of the food can tumble out when the bin is full and you have the bin positioned as shown . if you turn it so that the door is on top the problem is solved . my dogs cannot get into these containers nor do vermin . i have found them very durable and you can clean them as you like every so often with bleach or alcohol or whatever product you prefer . one of the main reasons that i like these is that they are actually pleasant to look at . you can also open the door with one hand . i have small dogs so food lasts fairly long . if i had larger dogs i would probably opt for a larger container . i have just ordered another from amazon . until i read the reviews i had not considered using them for anything but dogfood but i might consider how they could help me with other storage needs .my package just arrived and much to my disgust it contained a bergen storage bin doesn t match in a color that it ugly to me . i have messaged the seller . i ordered from blitz and it was filled by grady .amazon please tell your sellers that they are not allowed to do this .i have one lone cockatiel but i hated watching him play in the flight cage that i had . it really was the right size for one but i wanted a bigger one . when i found this cage i just had to have it . i could not believe it i checked the size times to be sure i was not imagining this .normally cages of this size are hundreds more money that i was not going to do . this one at this price was intriguing to me . there weren t many reviews so i went by my gut .happily i was right this cage is beautiful i ordered it and this came in a very timely manner . i opened the box and could not believe the size as i was putting it together . it was easy to assemble i did it myself the only problem was that a piece was damaged during shipping . i contacted the company and they assured me they will fix the problem right away .before i had time to get upset about it the new part was on my doorstep . this kind of customer service does not happen to often .i subsequently finished putting it together . i got all the toys and branches and perches in places put charlie in it and stepped back to take a look .it took my breath away . this is huge i can safely put another other birds in there and still have room .this cage is not very heavy but for this money is more than any bird s will ever need .i am very happy i decided to purchase this cage it is beautiful and functional . i have small side doors the open with a spring . i have two large one on front and one in back that i can push my whole arm in for cleaning . the wheels work fine and i pull him around when i am doing things in another room they hate to be far away from us so the wheels are a big plus .it come with very large perches and feed cups that are actually dual cups in themselves so it is like getting cups total .on the bottom is a pull out pan that slides right out making it a breeze to clean .there is nothing that i do not like about this cage i am just thrilled with it . i am also thrilled and actually shocked that the customer service was so nice . i will not hesitate buying from them again . . .i don t live very close to any pet supply stores so when i need something i usually order online or go to walmart if i am really desperate . i bought one gang valve from walmart thinking it was a pretty simple part and it wouldn t matter where i got it i was sooo wrong . the walmart one didn t work one little bit . this gang valve works perfectly . it has good seals all around adjusts easily and hangs on the back of the tank well .
i selected this printer over the samsung ml and the hewlett packard laserjet . after reviewing all three online and then live at an office supply store i ordered the brother hl . while the print quality may be similar for all three printers the brother hl s build quality easy memory upgrade path and cheap consummables made it the clear front runner . further distinguishing this machine is its superb handling of thicker media . it produces excellent results on cardstock using a convenient manual feed slot on the front of the machine . note also that the paper handling of the brother is in general more robust than its samsung and hp counterparts . the samsung uses the top loaded ink jet style paper feed system that tends to have less precise alignment . the hp uses a non removable paper tray that is flimsy at best . the brother on the otherhand uses a standard removable paper tray that is durable and handles envelopes and legal sized paper just as easily as letter sized . and don t discount the handy manual feed for the single envelope . out of the box usb setup of this unit on a windows xp home machine was a snap . the comes with a fully illustrated easy setup guide that will have you up and running in no time . all xp drivers are available on the disks that are shipping with these machines at the time of this review .one last note don t forget to order a usb or parallel cable with your printer !excellent printer terrible software .the included editing software is barely usable . you cannot cut and paste text from another application into your labels .text will usually printout lower than what a shown in the editor . a job that looks perfect on your display using print preview will look different when actually printed . be prepared for lots of wasted tape .i have the latest software from brother . c which only shows compatibility with older obsolete operating systems .if you want to use the printer stand alone you will probably be happy . the included editing software reminds me of mac os or windows . pros . takes normal batteries . . bright well focused laser . . uses radio frequency communication not ir so you do not need line of sight to the computer . it will go through a wood podium . . works great with apple keynote and microsoft powerpoint . . works great with mac os x windows and linux . . no need to screw around with bluetooth .cons none
almost too bright but i love it . maybe the watt model would be better than these s if your eyes are sensitive to bright lights . exactly what my dodge ram needed because the factory headlights stink . my brights were no brighter than my low beam and my old nissan had brighter brights but these kc watt driving lights solved that problem perfectly . for not being the full long range lights kc offers they sure shine pretty far plus spread the light out to the sides and up into the trees a good long range flood combination . i mounted them to my push brush guard . took about hours to install because i like to route hide and secure the wires very well . i connected the white switch relay hot wire to my high beam brights wire on the drivers side so they go on and off with my high low switch plus i have the master switch mounted without the switch frame near the dash to keep the kc lights off completely if i want . just make sure you dim your lights turn off the kc s before you see anyone ahead of you or you ll blind them and can get a ticket if on a public road . first night i tried them a big point ran across the road in front of me then stopped and pretty much tip toed off the road as if he was totally blind and afraid to move . so beware of animals freezing in front of you with these things . i turned them off and honked so he could run away . and no i don t hunt that way .the wiring diagram on the outside of the box did not show the white power relay wire as if it was pre wired into the main power wire but luckily there was the white power relay wire available to tap into my high beam wire . the wiring diagram on the directions in the box was correct . some vehicles newer than may not allow tapping into the high beam wire because of the vehicle s computer that senses voltage changes but it worked on mine . only thing i had to supply was a sheet metal screw to secure the relay . i cut off about feet of extra wire that went to the switch . the length of wire to the lights was just right .installed these with the kc windsheild mounts on my yj . the harness and instructions were really easy to follow .installed in less than hours with everything tied down and hidden . my wife and i were out in the jeep looking at christmas lights and i was on a dark road and flipped them on . wow ! these w daylighters definetely light up the road . they were so bright my wife asked if they were legal .several things you have two grounds make sure they are grounded to a good metal surface i used sandpaper to remove the paint about the size of a dime for my grounding points both in the engine compartment .if you have a narrow mounting location you may want to consider the slim lights these are heavy and shaped like a motorcyle headlight .the only negative thing i can say is that the light covers with the smiley face went out in the s . i painted mine black and placed a vinyl kc sticker on them . looks much better but still ordered the kc rock light covers so you can turn them on at any time without removing them . stars if they would have come with a rock guard cover instead of the solid yellow smiley faces . i have my daylighters mounted near the side pillars of my pickup and these guards clean up the look nicely . it also cuts down on the glare that shines onto the hood from my mounting location . i cant tell a huge difference on light output so that is a plus . they lock on so secure that i have actually cut my hand on them trying to get them off . wont lose them on the trail and its a nice deterrent to anyone looking to walk by and just pull it off to walk off with it .
this works just as advertised . needed something to clean the algae out of my intake tube on my filter and this fits the bill . the hard plastic intake pipe has multiple degree angles so pushing a towel in there doesn t get it all .i used this so i wasn t committed to the . length id get in installing my canister canister isnt able to be directly under the tank the canister is off to the side so i was able to run one hose to the other side of the tank and cutting it to custom length and still had the factory rubber hose ends to go into the aqua stop valve ong the canisterworks well for my needs gal breeder aquarium . its a little hard to get adjusted perfect and to clean . advice is to keep away from air stone . mounts easy and securly . attached directly to my fluval intake hose .
i have the ph flight cage for my parakeets and this large size cage cover was just the answer ! awesome fit great fabric quality made ! a i have a parakeet cockatiel and a small parrot and the cockatiel size works for all three birds they all like these nutriberries a loti could only fit about pounds of dog food in the quart size without the bag . different kibbles weigh differently so just keep that in mind when ordering so you can get the right size . i can fit a pound bag of taste of the wild in easily but the pound bag was too big even though i had already poured about of the bag out .
does a super job on brass copper silver aluminum bronze and stainless steel . polishes most metals to a mirror like finish . very similar to flitz polishing cream .the quik interior detailer is a great product from meguiars . this provides the finish i like on my interior not too glossy but a nice clean matte finish .this interior detailer spray also has a nice smell to it . safe for all surfaces vinyl leather plastic chrome navigation entertainment consoles and lcd screens .this does not only protect but cleans stains road film etc . off the paint and bring its to nice clean shine . my cars have ranged from light colours white and silver to darker colours red and blue and this works perfectly to clean and protect . sometimes depending on how dirty the paint was applications would be done to restore the finish . safe on clear coats and glass this is perfect . also one heavy shower does not remove the wax . give it a try .
perfect . had a smaller size for my macaw . this time bought the lg inch size . this is much better and very sturdy . going to put it in the cage tonight . hope he likes it works great but is on the small side as in not a large diameter gauge would be easier to read if it was bigger .great size for someone with a smaller dog and perhaps a smaller stature . i wouldn t recommend this amended size for a tall person .
i don t know who designed the leg feature of this thing but they need to go back to engineering school . when you unlock the legs to put them into their useable position they re quite difficult to pop open and once opened into place you can see distinct spots where the paint has worn off because the fit is too tight inside the upper body of the stand .it d truly be nice to come across a good stand like this that used button locks to hold the legs in place and that had more of an upright angle for the guitar . i just don t like the features of this stand at all .this stand is a little difficult to open . the top the gets very stuck and turned the wrong way . other than that the stand collapses very small into the black bag that came with it .unlike some other reviewers i have found no quality issues with mine it came symmetrically bent with a plastic pad that doesn t smell like anything it holds my harp exactly where it needs to be and is easy enough to remove all i need to do is loosen the bottom wingnut rotate the harp away from my mouth and lift the frame over my head .to change out harps bite down on your harp use your hands to depress the tabs on either side and then pull your head back sliding the harp out as you do to insert a new one place your harp in your mouth depress tabs and use your mouth to center the harp in between the plates when it is in position release tabs making sure not to get your lips caught between the harmonica and the plates as they pinch shut .
great product and low price . for use in all gas engines . east to measure and pour . i recommend will buy again and i hope this helps someone .recently purchased an usb oscilloscope for use in my projects . this set of test leads is worth it s cost from amazon . i do recommend this kit .i needed to replace a defective gas cap for my corvette due to a known defect with the original caps in this model year . i did some checking on the web and amazon had this ac delco part at about half the price i could find elsewhere . installed it upon receipt and it works perfectly . part works exactly as i expected and i recommend it to others who need a replacement for their corvette gas caps .
after reading numerous reviews talking about the exceptional volume and tone of this amp for the price about i had to try it .when i plugged my acoustic into this i was very pleased to find those reviews are accurate . first let s not expect double sound from a portable v amp . once that reality is recognized it s realized this puts out far better sound than one would ever expect from an amp this size and price .i would note that the sound you get out of this amp as with any amp will be directly relational to the quality of guitar and pickup you re feeding from . i tried this on three different guitars and each one sounded significantly different . one had very rich tone another sounded tinny another had a passive pickup and required i turn the honeytune up quite a bit more than the one with active pickup . so it won t sound the same on every guitar .that said if your guitar has good tone and your pickup is good this amp is simply awesome . i ve had it only one day so i haven t put it through the test of time . . . but first impressions are that i will buy more of these in the future i need more than one portable amp .my sister visited and heard it right after i opened the box and she was impressed as well . neither of us expected this kind of sound from such a small amp . and i have to say the aqua color is major retro . gotta luv it .i ve been looking for the portable amp for some time . this is the best i ve found to date and the value for price is a perfect balance . i don t know as i d pay the for this guitar shops often ask but the amazon price is perfect . one last thing danelectro branded v battery included same color as the amp . priceless .i was really looking forward to receiving this amp . i read the positive reviews and the ampeg name carries some weight . unfortunately from the moment i plugged it in there was this phaser like effect to the sound . i tried different basses with it . i tried different cables with it . i tried using it in different places away from computers and fluorescent lights . i tried all different combinations of all of those things and still the spacey phase shifter sound came out . i tried all different knob and eq settings as well . nothing helped . so i m returning it and hoping i just got a bad egg and that the next one will be better . i used to work for an amp manufacturer so i know these things happen and i don t think less of ampeg at least not yet .i really hope it s a better amp because the amp itself looks wonderful . for it s packed with cool features like an effects send a cd in a line out for hooking up to a pa and a headphone out for quiet practice . it also just looks cool and very pro . my intention is to use this for a monthly bistro gig where the volume is low and the area is pretty small so this seems absolutely perfect if i get one that performs like all the other reviews i see here .i have to say buying from amazon is the only way to buy these things online . they immediately started the process of shipping me a new one as soon as i filled out the return ups label . if there is a choice between amazon .com and other vendors and even if amazon is a couple bucks more i recommend using amazon . the customer service is so easy and immediate it s worth the piece of mind .i ll update this review when i get the new amp later this week .i upgraded my review based on the replacement i received . . .see below . . .i ve only been in broadcasting for years professionally and i have to say after researching condenser microphones for several months countless reviews and spec research i can honestly say this mic compares and indeed exceeds many microphones costing hundreds of dollars more .here s another interesting fact . i thought the king of all media howard stern would have used some gold plated thousand dollar anniversary rig . . . well i found out he uses a as well . so think about it perfect for the amateur perfect for the professional . . . and under dollars ? incredible ! you won t be disappointed on this buy .
i clayed the suv in just several hours ! this kit comes complete with the spray clay bars and a microfiber cloth . just wash the car well and start claying . you will be very happy with the difference your car feels after you clay !i used this wheel cleaner this past weekend on my stock painted alloy wheels . they had become dirty with brake dust and road grime and the drive through car wash was no help . with the nice weather i treated the car to a personal car wash . i followed the instructions and the wheels are clean . the only problem is you need to use a lot of the foaming spray to cover the wheels various surfaces . on my car one oz . bottle should cclean the four wheels twice . since this is the first wheel cleaner of this type i m not sure if that expensive . however i m very please with the easy no touch results .i learned about gold clay bars in a honda crv forum where car enthusiasts shared their favorite products .this was three years ago . since then i clay my car twice a year in the spring and the the fall .i just finished my spring treatment when a fellow walked by my car and asked if this was crv that i waswashing . i told him it was almost years old and he could not believe it . i have toadmit that the car does look like new with much of the credit to regular claying and using back to blackon plastic parts .i should mention that i store gold clay in a plastic container which used to contain onion dip . this keeps it pliable and clean . it is a bit strange that the container for clay did not come with the package . if clay dries out it will stop working . and it is sticky so if you leave it without some sort of container it will pick up dirt that could scratch the car the next time you use it .claying system removes contaminants that attach themselves to the car . clay does not polish the car or remove any paint of finish so it is totally safe to the finish if used properly i .e . with plenty of lubrication .the clay material which feels like play doh makes the small particulars that are deposited on the car finish attach themselves to the clay and get lifted from the car finish . clay needs to be used with heavy lubrication which showtime instant detailer included in this package provides .i start by washing my car . i don t dry it as this time as water drops will be removed by other steps . then i clay the car . i don t clay every inch of the entire car . i just examine the car by sight for any imperfections and by my running my hand over the paint to feel any tiny bumps . when i feel some grittiness or see some dirt on the paint i generously spray that section with showtime instant detailer then knead the piece of clay in my hand and rub it against the spot i identified . normally you see the dirt disappear in a few swipes . sometimes you need to reapply the detailer and repeat . kneading is important as you want to work the little pieces of dirt into the clay and not leave it on the surface of the clay ball where it can scratch the car . this year we had a rough winter and i had some rubber marks from my snow removal tool in addition to the regular dirt specs . clay did a great job on removing those marks .i also use the clay on non painted areas such as glass and chrome . it does a great job as well . after the claying step i wax the car is small sections .mothers california gold carnauba cleaner wax liquid ozas my final step i apply back to blackmothers back to black ozto non painted surfaces . this turns the dull plastic into shiny new looking surface . back to black is also effective in removing any wax that might have accidently got on the plastic that s why i do back to black as the last step .
i bought this because amazon suggested that it should be bought along with the brake controller . there is no need for it at all as the brake controller mounted just fine with the included hardware .great price quick delivery awesome customer service from camco i ordered kits and one kit had one piece in the kit that needed to be replaced and camco replaced the entire kit for me . highly recommendedi ve been looking to purchase a new jump pack for use in the shop and narrowed my selection down to either the clore jnc or the shumacker proseries dsr psj the reviews were about equal on both so i decided to get the jnc well i just received the jnc today and it is defective right out of the box .i plugged it in to charge and the amber led that is suppose to be lit does not indicate it is charging . the green led does not show it is fully charged either .i verified my power cord has power from the outlet even switched to another cord .disappointed i guess companies no longer have qc on their products .update feb after realizing that amazon will not accept returns on this item i contacted clore automotive tech support and explained that i had received a defective jump pack . i reviewed with them the various items i had checked to confirm that it was indeed defective .after they confirmed that i had purchased it via amazon they shipped a new jnc to me along with a prepaid ups label to return to them the defective unit . i had the replacement unit in days after contacting them . the replacement unit works great .clore automotive gets stars from me for making this disappointing defective unit right .
these sleeps sacks are very large though my son is in the middle of the recommended weight and at the end of the height rangeit s larger than i expected but i will keep it until my son can fit into it . my son is lbs and around inches which is why i bought the large based on the weight recommendation but even the medium is quite large on him right now . would suggest using the height recommendation as a closer indicator of what size to buy rather than weight .do not look at the weight ranges when deciding on a size . my son is at the top end of the size large weight range but this item will still fit him for many months . instead look at the height ranges for a more accurate size determination . my tall son is growing out of size month clothing but the size large sleepsack size months will fit him for many more months .
sweet little neck stand . very light weight . folds compact to fit in your guitar s hard case or gig bag . padded to protect guitar neck .comfortable and easy to adjust for length .additionally it easily snaps off the banjo when you want to put the banjo in a tight case . . .my case is tight around the head so i unsnap the strap and store it in the case by the neck of the banjo .this is a great padded case that fits my soprano uke just right . i like to ride my bike and take my uke along . the small size means it fits my panniers just fine . the thick padding protects the uke from bumps and scrapes . the larger foam nylon cases are nice and offer more robust protection but they don t fit into a shopping bag or backpack nearly as well . highly recommended for the adventurous uke player .
you expect tape to do a couple tasks adhere and disappear .scotch does both . rolls . . . means more of what tape needs to do .scotch magic tape is excellent for all sorts of uses . i work in a school and the uses of this tape are limitless ! !it works just like all other tape products from scotch . . . . .wonderfully . it s tape . what d you expect ? ! ?
i love that you can mix and match sounds with this sound soother my girls like the womb sounds particularly . however this thing is not even close to being loud enough to qualify as white noise . you have to put the thing directly into an infant s crib making the cord a choking hazard in order for them to even hear it . if you are like me and need the white noise to keep your baby from waking up from other sounds in the house you need something a lot louder .i wouldn t quite describe this as a must have but ours does get its fair share of use . as others have said its a plug in or battery operated sound maker . it plays womb sounds rain thunder etc . we often turn it on at bedtime to drown out other household noises . plus we notice our daughter seems to sleep better with music white noise in the background . my only criticism might be the volume . sometimes even when we have it up as loud as it will go certain sounds are barely audible unless you are right up on the machine . if your infant is a fussy sleeper this product is worth a try .this monitor had quite a bit of static but worked well if we placed it someplace with the sound turned down but we could see the lights on it it is very sensitive . it is too noisy to use while trying to sleep unless you are a fairly heavy sleeper or need a white noise machine ! .
this is only heat treated die cast zinc but covered by a lifetime warrantee limited to proper use .as such it should last okay however don t abuse it if the piston is that stuck your going to need to do the calliper anyway .be advised this bit is and inches long . description says . inches long which is not correct . did not work with my air hammer . its too short does not have enough space to travel when installed on the quick release . so will have to return and get a longer one .bought this because i wanted to measure the length of a specific body part of mine . unfortunately a ruler was too big to measure the length of it . i needed something very small in order to figure out how long it is .
works great no issues . bought this to adapt the mike plug to jack so the mike can plug into a regular amp for the grandkids to karaoke with .just a basic female xlr to inch male adapter . i use these so i can plug my regular mic cables into my keyboard practice all in one pa .i primarily use this as an usb adapter for my headphones so that i can connect convert the . mm headphone jack into my pc .the audio adapter is well built . it has a yellow led light that is solid when plugged into an usb port and blinks when there is a device that is connected to it through a . mm jack .installation was flawless . windows bit installed drivers immediately .no issues . no nonsense . simply works !
this is a great printer for someone who only needs something for personal use . if you need something for school or work this isn t something that is meant to hold up to everyday constant printing or copying . i have a laser printer for that . i use this for faxing and occasional copying and scanning with the printing for sometime color jobs sometimes pictures which works wonderfully . inkjets suck up ink it s a fact . you can get printers for the cost of cartridges now so if you pick out an all in one make sure that s what you need that s what i did . i love it !hp officejet all in one printer fax scanner copier q a aba high quality labels . do not jam in printer . they are very easy to use and work will all printers .for some reason canon has not gotten with the program . brother hp and most of the other companies realize that a lot of people have home networks and as a result people do not want an old fashioned printer that needs an expensive print server to setup .it would be nice if canon got this message as well since this printer is no good for networks when for the same price i can get an hp that does everything the mp does and can work wirelessly over a network . also this canon eats ink . if you plan on getting it you better get ready for frequent store runs .
this is an item that does what it says it does . comes in good shape and works well . what more can i say ?this dispenser has a nice look and feel to it easy to fill and use with only one hand . does what it is made to do which is always nice don t you think ? jmj p .s . it really looks better than what it shows in the picture .this works just as good as normal packaging tape and looks darling ! could also be used in crafts if so desired . . . .but not duct tape crafts . . . . .it does not seem sturdy enough for that . also as many have mentioned the dispenser packaging is very nice the colors are vivid and is lightweight .
sizes listed in reviews and the two in the description . x . x and . x . x don t match to what i received . . .the bag i received is in between what has been listed in the descriptions . x x empty .while seemingly a good quality bag with a fair amount of straps and attached rain cover hidden in the heel of the bag it seems the manufacturer or seller has no idea how to use a measuring tape !the bag itself is quite nice . . . good padding rubberized bottom to prevent sliding small pockets on either side and zippers seem of reasonable quality .for the price and bag quality i m not complaining . it works great on my cb and it does fit on the pillion of my vt c without having to remove my rider backrest so if you have standard seating or a touring adventure style this bag will do well for you as a pillion bag and with a little strap adjustments it also fits vertical on the front or back of a sissy bar or horizontal on a larger luggage rack . . .would recommend getting a size smaller than what the sizing chart recommends as i measure aroun my leg as recommended and the chaps were one size too large . . otherwise they are awesome quality and buildthe tender jr . does not come with a cigarette adapter so i cut this in half to make two . i purchased lighter plugs for a buck each from china with free shipping and they are working fine . these aren t an exact match with the tender cables but they fit together ok and are easy to determine polarity with the wire colors . you can also just use this as an extension cord for your tender . the description states a length of inches but it s actually inches tip to tip on the connectors . nice item for the price and it s made in mexico .
work s great for my trailer .use these in trailer tires car tires truck tires any tires these have saved me several times on the road pull the nail install one or of these reinflate with a small portable or my nitrogen tank if i m in the service truck back on the road .if you ride around the roads of south florida then you need this product in your tires . you will not have a flat ever again if you follow the dirrections ! it works
great cover ! i put it on in minutes after delivery and warming a little and it is not moving low s outside today but likely over f in the car . i do not have sweaty hands and it does not look like color came off . it is smooth leather and is dyed black much like belts and shoes which can rub off on contact belts do after repeated hand contact and probably stain the inside of belt loops without our knowing . for those with sweaty hands get a rubber cover with grips stinky or vinyl slippery but neither are very durable in hot cars you won t be as happy with the comfort unless it is leather . non leather will smell toxic or be slippery but it will not bleed color . if your hands sweat they may slip on vinyl or smooth rubber . this product has a great grip and feel and leathery smell .there is an inner rubber sleeve non smelly that prevents the cover from moving . i set the product in the sun for about minutes and it made it ply able enough to work it on . i recommend starting with the center most seam on top of a straight wheel there are seams at roughly o clock carefully work the outer edge over the wheel and down both sides evenly the first s is easy use patience and care then roll the edge into position . if it is off center it cannot be slid sideways . take it off carefully and begin again with it more centered and work each side evenly a little here a little there . do not put this on cold or stretch without warming it can damage crack tear cold leather .i placed this on a chevy aveo steering wheel do measure your wheel diameter before ordering . the only con to these types of covers is they cannot wrap the inside so the fingers feel the outer edges of the cover in this case it is smooth rolled and well stitched and i have gotten used to it . it is probably made in china at this price but it looks and feels like good quality . i recommend this and would choose to buy again and recommend to a friend . i also recommend a little leather conditioner on this much like one would use on leather car interiors . it is smooth leather not suade or roughened .in the old days i bought wrapped stinky vinyl and used vinyl to thread through holes and wrap around the cover with tension still available and it filled the inner part of the wheel . it was difficult and time consuming and the vinyl strings eventually breaks . i recommend this new and improved version . rubber and vinyl degrades in heat and uv . did you know that wonderful new car smell is highly carcinogenic expecially when hot and all the glue they use on carpeting and interior fabric also . this has been well known and accepted for over years but it sells cars . fyi .i have used this same model cover on my bike for nearly a decade and this is my fourth cover purchase . they are fantastic quality and fit for the price !storage indoors and the cover will easily last years if you re careful not to snag it as it will tear easily on sharp corners mirrors license plates etc . . for the first years of my bike s life it was stored indoors and one cover lasted easily during that period . . . where i live now i don t have that luxury yet .outdoors this cover will keep your bike dry and protect it from harmful uv damage for at least two seasons mine started to fall apart after years of year round outdoor coverage but i also coat it annually with camp dry to increase water repellent ability and uv protection . the elastic does start to give out after a couple of years but still holds the cover securely on the bike in high winds .sizing for sizing the xl fits perfectly slightly snug around the license plate and rear turn signals over my cc honda sabre with windshield large saddle bags and small tour pack behind sissy bar . this xl fits exactly the same as the xl made years ago with the only exception being the snugness around the license plate and rear turn signals . . . i d be happier with an extra inch or two of material back there .if i had to buy again it would be a toss up as to the xl or xxl . my last one was an xxl and it was very loose fitting which caused it to flap in the wind catch wind under it and sagged in heavy rain which created places where water would pocket on top or droop to the seat level eventually soaking through the material . the xxl also covered almost all the way to the ground which meant more chances of getting it dirty at the bottom or having hot pipes engine touching the black material not the heat resistant silver .design change the newest version of this cover also does not have silver running degrees around the cover as in the picture . the black material of the top now covers down to the front wheel and the silver starts right behind the forks . this does help you to find the front of the cover in poor lighting and actually looks much better when on the bike .cons my only real issue is that the material of the newest version of this cover is slightly thinner and more nylon feel than cloth feel of the ones made years ago or even five years ago and the cover does not have the full nelson rigg logo . . . missing more than just a bike wording below the logo . . . no biggie but having the full logo does make it easier to find the front of the cover in the dark i do not believe the thinner feeling material affects the cover in the least as mine has successfully kept my bike clean and dry during heavy snowfalls and torrential downpours over the past three months and still looks like new . we ll have to see about longevity . . . but if it lasts years in outdoor conditions i ll not be complaining !update when putting the cover on my bike today in anticipation of rain the cover ripped as tension was placed over the windshield and mirrors . the rip was not bad but very disappointing to spend on a cover that has barely held up to months of use and very mild weather ! i will be contacting nelson rigg to obtain a replacement under warranty !i was suprised how well and how easy they worked even on an extended van . it saves wear and tear on the shoulders .
this mic stand will work great for mic ing full stacks and guitar amps .some people have mentioned the counterweight could be heavier but they need to pay attention to how they are orienting the feet in relation to the microphone . you should make sure one of the feet is pointing in the exact same direction as the microphone arm so that way the downward force is applied directly onto the support leg .it s just unbelievable how well this device holds picks . i mean you just insert your guitar picks in this device and bam it holds them ! no further action is necessary ! and when you need a pick you just pull one out and there it is !what will they think of next ?very authentic sound reproduction . simple to install but be aware that the instructions are not very clear . the threaded end is holed so you can hook it with a wire to pull it into position on the tailstock . you ll never get your arm in there far enough . lolyou will need a nd drill bit to complete the install .
honestly i don t know how any aquarium could do without this ultra convenient and easy to use accessory in my handbook it is necessary . like many other reviewers have already stated it is a grand item that actually does what it claims to do in this day age of false advertising to supposedly numb consumers .now if it were to come in a color better suited to being displayed right there on the front window of my fish s world . . . i would buy another one . the one for acrylic aquariums is blue but mine for glass is off white . perhaps i ll dip mine in something mirror finished . and don t sell your company so someone else can make a cheaper crappier product either . well done mag floaters !good airline tubing ! very soft and easy to cut . however i do wish they come with a more less noticeable color though . . .but other than that love it !when purchasing this kitty kap patented you are receiving one cap . others have mentioned it and i will post pictures .this is a good cap for the larger . ounce cans and i have not tried it for the smaller cans but it should work . i paid nearly . for the top but i thought i was getting two of them . i hope the seller will make it clearer that the buyer is receiving only one .the plastic is thick and durable and the design with the ridges to fit every can seem to be reasonable . i did want to make note that there was a sticker inside the lid that states intended for pets only keep out of the reach of children ? ? ? ? what about covering a can of human food . . . is that a problem ?why ? does it have something to do with lead content in the plastic ? if so please state this . why the warning or clarification sticker make this clear in the description .the product seems nice but i am giving it three stars for the amazon presentation the outlandish price and the warning sticker .keeping them honest .
i don t live very close to any pet supply stores so when i need something i usually order online or go to walmart if i am really desperate . i bought one gang valve from walmart thinking it was a pretty simple part and it wouldn t matter where i got it i was sooo wrong . the walmart one didn t work one little bit . this gang valve works perfectly . it has good seals all around adjusts easily and hangs on the back of the tank well .i have one lone cockatiel but i hated watching him play in the flight cage that i had . it really was the right size for one but i wanted a bigger one . when i found this cage i just had to have it . i could not believe it i checked the size times to be sure i was not imagining this .normally cages of this size are hundreds more money that i was not going to do . this one at this price was intriguing to me . there weren t many reviews so i went by my gut .happily i was right this cage is beautiful i ordered it and this came in a very timely manner . i opened the box and could not believe the size as i was putting it together . it was easy to assemble i did it myself the only problem was that a piece was damaged during shipping . i contacted the company and they assured me they will fix the problem right away .before i had time to get upset about it the new part was on my doorstep . this kind of customer service does not happen to often .i subsequently finished putting it together . i got all the toys and branches and perches in places put charlie in it and stepped back to take a look .it took my breath away . this is huge i can safely put another other birds in there and still have room .this cage is not very heavy but for this money is more than any bird s will ever need .i am very happy i decided to purchase this cage it is beautiful and functional . i have small side doors the open with a spring . i have two large one on front and one in back that i can push my whole arm in for cleaning . the wheels work fine and i pull him around when i am doing things in another room they hate to be far away from us so the wheels are a big plus .it come with very large perches and feed cups that are actually dual cups in themselves so it is like getting cups total .on the bottom is a pull out pan that slides right out making it a breeze to clean .there is nothing that i do not like about this cage i am just thrilled with it . i am also thrilled and actually shocked that the customer service was so nice . i will not hesitate buying from them again . . .i bought it for my turtle and fish and it just does not filter anything and i tested it to see if maybe i was wrong and i was not . i think i might have to rethink even having pets at all since i can not get the right equipment for them
i have the ph flight cage for my parakeets and this large size cage cover was just the answer ! awesome fit great fabric quality made ! a booda perches are great ! they can be manipulated to fit different size bird cages and add variety to the perching needs of our feathered children .got this to line the crate for our chihuahua it is very soft and looks very nice . it fits the crate perfect .
this is a rock solid throne that has a wide adjustment range for height and a workable range for the backrest .the height of the backrest is fixed but you can adjust how far back it can be moved . i am referring to lateral motion and not a tilt angle . the seat itself has a nice comfortable padding that is about on par with a mid range drum throne i apologize but that is my best reference for comparison . assembling is simple and fast . i had some issues lining up the seat height that stemmed from the need to perfectly align two outer and two inner holes in the frame and seat bar but after getting a feel for the tight tolerances i managed to get it done with no problems .another thing to note is this is primarily for guitarists . the foot rests are not going to be much used by drummers in particular nor by keyboardists whose feet will probably be busy with sustain and expression pedals . however . this is still ideal for keyboardists because the seat is comfortable and the backrest promotes good posture .i used this with drums . but be aware that the seat will not swivel so the front bar across the bottom can interfere with pedals and your snare drum stand unless you move it back a bit .the final note is this is heavy and somewhat clunky to transport . it s not a deal breaker . on the contrary it will reduce performance fatigue because of the ergonomic design and that alone offsets any inconvenience .like many here the case could be an inch bigger . for my ibanez i cut the bottom material along the edge against the side wall enough to take out the bottom foam and then put the material back . now mine closes without pressure on the bridge .it has a comfortable seat and seems stable and well made . however if you need to haul it around frequently it takes a bit of time to set up and screw down or open up the screws that hold the moving stability bar on the bottom of the seat . also if you need to adjust the height you have to remove the entire bolt assembly seen at the crossing point of the bars and then select one of three holes that are only an inch or some apart from each other . so not much selection there .
its working great but it does not work in stereo . it is a mono adapter the stereo adapters are a little more expensive .the delay pedal was inexpensive and it works . i dont find a lot of variance in the adjustments but it does the job it was made for . the case may be plastic but it appears quite rugged .this is an a pedalit s small and fits on a complex pedal board nicely it does one thing and it does that one thing perfectly . . .the mxr micro flanger works great with distortion or just turn down the effect level and speed up the rotation and it works beautifully on clean passagesif you want a flanger to do any more than that you re just goofing off mostly i need a subtle wash for flanger work and the mxr micro is perfect for that
this is a great little filter . it pumps gallons per hour and has loads of filter media for a powerfilter of this size . don t be fooled by the inefficient filter cartridges used by other brands . this is the filter you want .i bought this as replacement charcoal for my tom mini internal filter . so far i have used just a pinch since the charcoal chamber of the filter is so tiny . at this rate this size bottle should last me over a hundred years . i should have purchased a smaller size .the emperor filters are the best quality and effective out there . there are models with bio wheels and take size e cart rages . i use the model for my gal frag tank with up to alligator snapping turtle hatchlings at a time . most will argue that the is overkill you don t need a filter of that size . the power and the easy dissembly the cartrages and the extra media holders for a custom mix of different media from carbon to peat and the bio wheels that last for years . hand down the best .the amazing low price s amazons offers . these monster filters are like . i thought the model was . it s worth that price . at petco two size e cartages sell for . in rhode island . on amazon four cartages sell for . and if your smart enough to become a prime member you will receive your order two days later free shipping .next day delivery only . marine land black diamond is the highest quality active carbon for sale . it s dollars more than say hagen carbon . but it last twice as long . the emperor filters come with great instructions bio wheels and cartrages cleaning brushes custom media holders and intake extensions for deeper water . i have owned a dozen aquarium filters used for aquatic reptiles and freshwater fish . old school air bubble filters to my favorite the fluval fx canister filter . the emperor will handle a gal tank . id not hesitate to use one on a gal . for you can customize these babies for all aquatic animals and tank sizes . marineland canaister filters are not the same quality as the hang on emperor filters . there cheaply made i sent one back recently . i don t understand why the quality would not be upthere with there emperior series ? eheim canasters are rated the best . the fluval canasters are great . to replace the media in the green machines will cost you 
this nylabone is a fav for my labs perfect size and it lasts through their chewing wear and tear they are not gentle !item arrived as expected . . . great toy for those dogs that love to fetch . . . and it saves your shoulder and arm my border collie loves this item and yes i can wear him out now before he wears me out . this sunglasses are awesome ! my dogs do not love wearing them but will when given treats and are slowly warming up to wearing them often . eye disease is common in older dogs so the sooner you start protecting the more likely your dogs can avoid it . not to mention my dogs look incredible cute in these . they are well made and seem comfortable when adjusted the correct way . just make sure to reward your dog for wearing them and begin in small increments . love them and would absolutely recommend for everyone s whose dog spends time out in the sun or at the beach .
with musical instruments standing about on my office floor i determined to find a better way to keep them available and so i decided to hang them on the walls . this hanger was very easy to install . it comes with screws and anchors so that it can be attached to drywall itself or through drywall and into wall studs . i used the pre drilled holes as a template to mark my wall and the hanger went in easily . but a word of warning use a level to align the hanger to a vertical position on your wall . if you don t your guitar will hang a bit cock eyed .this was very easy to put together ! top just slips on the folding bottom part of stand and is very adjustable . love it !fits nicely and tight on standard wide threaded microphone stands . if you have the smaller screw headed ends on your microphone stand you can get a little threaded adapter at any music store for next to nothing . maybe a dollar if they don t just give it to you . using this with stands that have a heavy round base takes up less space onstage and other places as well as making it easy to relocate and keep out of the way .no need for a tripod stand with the legs folding up and out getting in the way plus most inexpensive tripods are cheaply made very light and will break easily when moving gear or simply tripping over them .the base screws down all the way onto the stand until it is hand tight .the set screw allows for tilting and turning adjustment of the camera .the set screw presses against a ball socket hinge and has a plastic thumb knob that seems a little fragile . i am very careful not to over tighten in fear of twisting off the plastic thumb tightening knob .i am also leery of stripping the set screw or the threads inside the housing but at this price i guess you can t expect to have a sophisticated adjustment mechanism eh ?there is a notch in the side of the housing to allow for a degree preset angle .the metal thumbscrew that attaches the base of the camera to the adapter has a rubber washer as well as a thin rubber mat acting as like a cushioning gasket when tightened to your camera .be careful . the metal thumbscrew can easily fall out from the holding plate when transporting removing or switching cameras . i found a little plastic threaded washer like ring that screws onto the holding plate screw when not in use . you could easily find many types of washers screws plastic pieces etc . to hold it in place when in storage or transport . you could also leave it attached to your camera . either way be careful not to let it fall out and get lost .overall the little thing is quite solid heavy and sturdy and takes up little to no real estate and does a great job at being small basic solid and inexpensive .it holds well when bumped or moved . mine has absolutely no slop in it does not wobble or come loose . i would not put a larger sized mm camera or heavy camera on this adapter . most modern devices will do just fine .again just make sure you tighten it up just enough to hold it well . don t put the grip of hercules on it and it should last for years . mine has .i m happy with mine and bought our drummer one for christmas .hope this helps !
bought this to install with an aftermarket kenwood navigation on my toyota tacoma . it took several hours to install but it works great with the wheel controls in my toyota .this connector fit my crv perfectly and made the wiring ofr a new hitch receiver a snap . i am pleased that honda had the plugs already attached to the harness and that curt used that setup to make this easy for me .great quality and the welded on nut makes it easy to install or remove . fits a ninja and er n
i have one of these on my guitar and one on my ukulele . i can t imagine life without this pick holder before i was always losing picks and then i had to strum with my fingers which i don t like doing . get one of these if you play with a pick !these have the correct thickness and texture that i want but they are smaller than a typical pick . so be sure to try them out first before buying . one just cannot tell the size from the picture amazon has . i wish they put a reference picture by the side of this pick may be dim the ref image a little so people won t get confused . some people swear by these but i that find my fingers get a little numb after playing these for an hour or two . may be you need to get acclimated to this pick before you can fully use it effectively and for long duration . i won t be buying these again .the guitar picks were exactly what i was looking for . i like hard picks and these were the ones i needed .
i purchased this when it was on sale during the christmas season i figured that for the asking price at the time i could not go wrong .my expectations were frankly low . i had heard nothing but horrible things about epiphones with the main complaint being they would not stay in tune . other complaints included poor overall quality and terrible playability . what i received was the polar opposite i received an instrument with a strikingly beautiful finish and one that stays in tune amazingly it was close to being in perfect tune when i unboxed it . i am not wild about the strings that came stock but i am a drummer and suffer the same disappointment about heads that ship with new drums . i guess guitarists expect to change strings on a new guitar the same way drummers do when it comes to heads . in the near future i intend to restring the guitar withd addario ecg chromes flat wound electric guitar strings light which while thick should make the instrument jazz friendly . i realize that flatwound strings will require a new set up and intonation but considering how good the guitar is and how relatively little it cost me the new strings and work will be an investment .out of the box though the action was reasonably low and the frets appeared to my novice eyes and fingers to be properly dressed . i have already invested in a good but not great case guardian hardshell electric guitar caseto store the guitar i also uploaded a customer provided photo on this page that shows the case and how well the guitar fits . for the record i use the following amp which i have also reviewed that is a perfect match to this guitar kustom defender watt class a guitar headthat i run through akustom the defender x guitar extension cabinet for h head .bottom line this is a great instrument for beginners and not a bad one for experienced players . the price is right and the quality clearly shows that off shore manufacturers have made significant improvements over the past year .right out of the box this guitar was flawless . i played it with the strings it came with to inspect intonation fret buzz etc . the old strings would work for set up if needed and the intonation harmonics at the fret exactly matched the fretted note at the th fret was dead on . absolutely no fret buzz even at the st fret . i have been playing guitar for years and i have seen my fair share of acoustic guitars in that time . to say this is a beautiful playing and sounding instrument just doesn t do it justice . i have played many expensive acoustic guitars that didn t sound or play as well as this even after set up . the lows are nice and clear and the highs are clear without sounding tinny or banjo like . a very well built great sounding guitar . for the price you can t go wrong . i would recommend this guitar to novices and pros . i was not expecting a guitar of this quality for such a low price . satisfied . rock on jasmine ! !i bought this pedal new hoping to get an electric solid body guitar to sound somewhat like an acoustic guitar on stage . i knew going in that it would not sound like a martin d but i thought it would be good enough to play a couple of acoustic parts without having to switch guitars .imagine my profound disappointment .really boss ? ? ? this is by far the worst pedal i have ever used of yours . this thing has a terrible hiss when you turn the top control higher than about o clock . at first i thought i must have a defective unit but then i started reading reviews on line . seems like it is part of the design . it s too bad because one can hear some promise in the faux acoustic tones hidden beneath a wall of fizz . totally unusable as far as i m concerned . by the way i tested it direct to a pa as well as into a guitar amp with a single coil guitar strat .
works as intended easy to plug in and charge the motorcycle batteries .i double checked with volt meter at the end of charging and was at proper voltagenice high amp current rating on this . i epoxy it to a ah volt gel battery and i can use it as a jumpstarter oremergency power supply for camping or power outages .after a power outage i connected my refrigerator to this power supply . sadly its inverter was unable to support my refrigerator . the duracell dpp hd doesn t have enough momentary output to handle the initial start up current spike of a refrigerator s compressor motor . the specifications say it can momentarily provide up to watts . this equates to amps at v . yet public benchmark figures for a home refrigerator s start up current indicate amps for up to second . other appliances that use electric motors such as sump pumps are likely to exhibit the same characteristics . my suggestion is that customers immediately test this product with any device they intend to power during an outage .some important specifications are missing in the amazon listing . one of the key statics is the capacity of the internal battery which is amp hours at v . this equates to watt hours . yet ac output is much lower than this presumably due to inverter losses . these losses increase with power output . the following table illustrates this . the last column is my calculation .load . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .watts . . . .hours . . . .watt hourscordless telephone . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . portable stereo . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . laptop computer . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . fan . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . tv . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . drill . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . warm air fan heater . . . . . . . . . . . . . . blender . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . hid floodlights . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . observe that the total energy delivered watt hour drops with power consumption . ultimately the usable energy is significantly less than what is contained within the lead acid battery .for reference a refrigerator will use about watts of electricity when the compressor is running . typical consumers will have their refrigerator running about to of the time which equates to an average of watts being consumed continuously .consdoesn t handle current spikes associated with certain electric motorsprosboth ac and dc outputportablesimple operation
they do work . exactly as advertised . hane no fear on buying these . fit the chevy silverado wt tailgate rods .works just like it needs to . perfect fit for the tailgate on my chevy when the oem clip busted .works great . fairly easy swap . just be aware the front window regulators are the same on whether you have a suburban or tahoe or one of their gm family members . not so for the rear regulators . the full size suvs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones . the vehicle input feature amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference . the pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at but the vehicle id feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit . beware ! ! ! ! just so you know the dorman and fit the full size and the and fit the tahoe size vehicles .
before ordering this fax machine i did a bit of research well actually a lot because it wasn t so easy to look up the information i needed on the internet or in amazon reviews .first question i asked myself was could i use a fax with my current at t u verse voice ? secondly could i continue to use my phone with an answer machine and two cordless phones without having to use the phone built into the fax machine ? i only wanted a fax for personal use and use occasionally receive and send a maximum of ten pages no color necessary speed of sending and receiving not important cost and efficiency were a must and i would want to use the same phone number for both fax and voice . there was way too many fax machines to choose from and the prices went from low to very high . no where could i find instructions on the internet as to whether or not i could use a fax with my at t u verse voice .through amazon reviews internet tech sites brand names such as hp brother s and so on i searched and still couldn t get any answers . after a great deal of wasted time i finally gave up and called at t u verse voice tech support . the tech assured me i could use a fax with u verse voice . it was very simple i would plug my extension phone to the fax and use the plug from the extension phone to plug into the fax which was already plugged into my u verse gateway allowing both my phone and fax to operate off voip but both phone and fax could not be used simultaneously that is you can t talk on the phone while receiving or sending a fax .after reading amazon reviews and internet reviews for the best fax for me it turned out to be this one brother fax . just to be on the safe side before buying it i read the manual on line from page to page and it appeared this would have every thing i needed .amazon shipped quickly and the installation began . getting my external phone and fax connected was simple . putting the fax together from the box was simple . as for programming the fax now that got a bit complicated but it appears i got it right . all phones have a dial tone . brother allows you to send a test fax registration to them and they will send one back to you . sending my two page fax was slow but easy . when brother sent a fax to me the fax caught the special fax tone just as my answer machine began . it cut the answer machine off about half way through and began printing the fax . the print was sharp better than the ones i ve seen at work .so far i can say this is the perfect fax for me . there is still a few things i need to learn but so far so good . if you have at t u verse voice you can call their tech support if you want . be sure to follow the instructions very carefully . you can use the manual they send you or use the one online which you can download and save . would i recommend this for at t u verse voice ? absolutely ! if things change i will come back and update this comment but hopefully that won t have to be done .i am disappointed with the phone and am returning it because sound quality noticeably poor it is tinny to me and folks i call zero consideration of voicemail . this phone has an answering machine if i could buy one that didn t have one i would but you have the ability to turn it off . on or off if you don t use it set the rings to or more so that your voicemail kicks in first and someone leaves a message on voicemail the phone has no way of indicating that there is a voicemail message for you to pick up . the user has to pick up the phone and listen for the stutter dial tone to detect whether there is a voicemail . other phones i ve owned years older have the flexibility to deal with this quite common situation .the phone has good points it has a solid feel to it the volume of the speaker phone is good and the basics like lit keypads and easy to use menus are there .but for me the voice quality a key factor is lacking and the issue of voicemail notification combine to make the phone not one that i would recommend purchasing .i ve given this phone more than a fair trial . i ve purchased this and phones three times . the has no answering device but identical handsets . all of their identical handsets have malfunctioned immediately or eventually . the first time one of the screens lost contrast and became unreadable . the last two times the handset became inoperable after being left off of the cradle for several hours . none of the buttons would respond until the phone was recradled for a moment . this would happen even after the batteries were fully charged . i returned the first two for refunds but the third time i sent a message to vtech s online support . their email response was due to the nature of your inquiry your request would have to be handled by a representative who will provide you with the more detailed information . but when i called the tech support number provided i infuriatingly discovered that they only have automated tech support when you select the support phone menu option . so i called the sales number and the rep said they are trying out this new automated approach to tech support . that is they have decided to ditch genuine support .i asked to speak to a sales supervisor and he said that they have had other complaints about the inoperable handsets . he offered to send me replacement handsets saying that he thought they have fixed the issue . which brings up the obvious question why are they still permitting retailers to sell units that vtech knows have defects ? i ve only had this one for a week . shouldn t those defective phones be recalled ? the supervisor s only response was to chuckle nervously .so while these phones have good talk time and audio quality and respectable features i can t recommend them since they are highly prone to defects and the company has such a laughable excuse for support .
easily contains our power strip and multitude of plugs behind the tv . not the most attractive solution but it works .this fits a very specific style of power strip . fully straight single row .not all kits include scissor digital thermometer tweezer etc . this is one does . the compact pouch securely holds everything in place which is great for traveling . great value !
i have a tall aquarium and i like to intake water to the filter from a lower level than i would be able to without the extension tube .the extended tube helps to circulate water from the bottom to the filter to remove debris from the water at a lower level and facilitates the heating of the water throughout the tall aquarium so that the water at the lower water column is as warm as it should be .i have to reset the top of the skimmer part every day to allow it to float on the top of the water and then within hours usually it has sunk down so the whole thing is underwater again and no longer skimming the surface as intended . also you need to have a cut out on the hood to allow the adjustment knob to stick through unless you have your top water level about down from the top . i like the water level to be above the plastic band of the top of the aquarium so you dont see the water level when viewing .this product works fine but please keep your expectations reasonable .peat is used to soften the water and lower ph . it does so by reducing carbonate hardness . this is the water s buffering capacity . once the carbonate hardness has been lowered the ph will start to drop . the buffering capacity is the water s resistance to ph drops . to drop the ph you first have to lower the resistance .peat may not work for you if your tap water is very hard . a high gh usually accompanies a high kh carbonate hardness . if the water is too hard peat alone may not be enough to lower your ph . in my situation the gh out of the tap is approximately ppm ! with water this hard peat alone will not do the job . you would first need to remove most of the hardness . which you can do using several different methods . reverse osmosis ion exchange or using rain water .
the user guide for this calculator is obviously either written for another model or by a tech writer who has serious problems . in many instances when keystroke examples are provided if you key in the information as indicated the calculator will simply give up and provide an error message .the machine works fine if you just address it intuitively after you have trashed the guide book .i purchased this item believing it to be fully compatible with mac os x . however i was unable to get it to work at all under mac os x . . nothing but chittering feedback sounds . i emailed the manufacturer directly about the problem and they responded unfortunately we do not currently have a timeline for mac os x . . support . we are sorry if your os is os x . . and would like to suggest that you return the mv to the retailer where you purchased the mv . disappointing !i recommend the canon mp provided you can get along with usb and no networking . the product is otherwise well featured and has performs according to specs .if you are faxing using a voip line and getting errors using the default settings set your transmit and receive data rates lower . i use because its reliable albeit slow .i find the user interface for any non simple tasks to be below average and counter intuitive . i agree with other posters that sections of the manual are incomplete . the internet needs the ability for users to directly comment and enhance manuals .wish there was a model with wireless networking .
use this stuff in a gal tank on top of my ugf . liter is the perfect amount to cover a x area . matrix is the way to go for filter media .these filters are awesome . nice and quiet . adjustable water flow . and the fact that you can basically customize your filter media is great . only things keep these from being perfect . the main thing is the gallon size they are rated for . in my opinion if it says good for to gallon size tank for example you are better off putting it in the smallest size of the range listed . the one i got for my gallon tank just seems a wee bit too small to really handle a full gallons so i ordered a larger size and will be putting this gallon rated one on my gallon tank . the second thing is if you customize your filter media make sure you weight it down somehow . was having a problem with my media filter floss floating to the top making the bio max sit completely above the water in the filter . using the manufacturer s media which i am sure they recommend does not result in this problem the sponges that come with these are firmly held in place by tabs in the media basket . bottom line . . .these are as close to perfect as you can get .perfect for my and gallon tanks . had a larger version for a gal tank like another reviewer and i don t know what took me so long to buy the inch size . love it !
i have this item hooked on my motorcycle with the loop connection so it can be quick hooked or unhooked for summer time .it is smart to give warning lights as it can differentia between battery and alternator voltage .pros indicator light while charging . shows when charging is complete .ac power cable .easy to get inexpensive terminal adapters so you can leave them on your vehicle and trickle charge as necessary .
i bought this phone after returning an at t . ghz cordless set . i was a little wary because of the poor quality of the at t phone but the reviews on amazon gave me the confidence to try this uniden model .the reviews here are spot on . the phone has excellent range and voice quality and its minor detractors are just that minor . here are my observations pros this system is expandable to handsets including the handset on the base . this gives maximum flexibility in deploying in your home or small office . don t be confused . get the tcx handset . msrp . this is the one that is recommended for provided with this phone i believe amazon recommends some other handset . very good voice quality . clear signal no interference . this was a major detractor for the at t phone . ring tones musical ringers . you also have the ability to set personal ringtones for people in your address book . you can set different ring tones on each handset . up to numbers in your address book . however the phone book and cid system share memory so it s a total of numbers . hm . but each phone book entry can have numbers so you don t have to have multiple name entries for person e .g . mom home mom work . however the multiple entries are not delimited by text so you have to remember which is home and which is work . directlink walkie talkie mode . you can set two phones into direct mode and do a walkie talkie system . however you also have an intercom capability as well . multiple handset conference call capabilities . if you pick up a call on one handset someone else can join in just by turning on a second handset . dropping off is easy . . .just turn off the phone . there s also a privacy mode in each handset that enables you to turn off this function . do not disturb function can be set on the base it will turn off all the ringers on all the handsets . advanced caller id . capable of normal caller id plus call waiting caller id . caller id to phone book . can store a caller s info into the directory . room baby monitor . can listen to the sounds from any room that has a base handset . speakerphone on base and handsets . nice ! customizable handset banners . name them for the room where they belong ! remote access . standard stuff . only a two digit security code though . one key speed dial . set up to speed dial numbers . press the speed dial number and hold and it will bring up the corresponding speed dial entry . it doesn t dial until you re ready just in case you picked the wrong speed dial . normal answering machine features . call screen toll saver etc . i wish it had a dial out notification .cons no dial in remote room monitoring . this would be nice to dial into the system and hear what s going on . phone books and cid shared but not synchronized . you have to copy the phone books from one handset to another instead of it being sync d across all handsets . you also have to delete cid from each individual handset . base display is a little convoluted and confusing . the only way you can see if the answering machine is on off is when it s actually off an icon appears . this was a little confusing . most machines have a little glow light button that turns the machine on or off . you have to do this through the ui . shorter answering machine record time . only minutes up to messages .all in all this is an excellent choice and value .many cute features on this phone include being able to program a name with a specific ringer verbal caller id just says the number or unknown caller different screensavers etc . the range on this phone is excellent and i can hear quite clearly from a distance . also being . ghz it won t interfere with wireless routers and wireless cameras . excellent buy !i am disappointed with the phone and am returning it because sound quality noticeably poor it is tinny to me and folks i call zero consideration of voicemail . this phone has an answering machine if i could buy one that didn t have one i would but you have the ability to turn it off . on or off if you don t use it set the rings to or more so that your voicemail kicks in first and someone leaves a message on voicemail the phone has no way of indicating that there is a voicemail message for you to pick up . the user has to pick up the phone and listen for the stutter dial tone to detect whether there is a voicemail . other phones i ve owned years older have the flexibility to deal with this quite common situation .the phone has good points it has a solid feel to it the volume of the speaker phone is good and the basics like lit keypads and easy to use menus are there .but for me the voice quality a key factor is lacking and the issue of voicemail notification combine to make the phone not one that i would recommend purchasing .
cobra cpi a bc awg heavy duty ac power inverter cable kitwas cheaper to buy the already made kit than make your own .fantastic price for a very handy tool in the garage ! when working on automotive and motorcycle accessories one needs to power them up to test them or their function and this power source provides the juice required . you can also use auto accessories having the standard cord and cigarette lighter plug e .g . cb radio car vac inflator etc . i use mine for testing lighting and accessories i install .the innova auto ranging digital multimeter is a good meter especially for the price . it s well made and has features usually found in more expensive meters . batteries are included which is good . having to remove screws and take the meter apart to replace them not so much . the test leads are ok . the rubber holders on the meter do a very poor job of holding them when not in use but it s not a big deal . there is no case of any kind included . the meter seems fairly accurate . the auto ranging can take a few seconds to stabilize and there is no manual override . overall this is a very good meter for use around the home or the garage mechanic . professional mechanics will probably want buy a meter that costs more than though . the innova auto ranging digital multimeter is a great value and i recommend it .
there s got to be something about me and chairs . i just can t stand to sit without putting my feet up on something . it was so nice to find this m footrest . the relief on my back was instant .i can raise the footrest by unscrewing four screws . i can definitely feel the difference between and . i prefer my footrest lower to the ground .i can adjust the footrest to any angle with the touch of my feet . the swivel mechanism can be tightened and loosened but it was perfect when i got it so i left it alone .i m and this works well for me . i think shorter people or children whose feet don t touch the ground could really benefit from this . i don t have that problem but my back is telling me propping my feet up is a good thing . glad i got this footrest .i am average height for a female but i have a short torso and need to sit very high in relation to my desk and computer monitor . therefore my feet dangle off the edge of my chair . this footrest is sturdy with a nice non slip surface . initially i thought this footrest wasn t tall enough for me but then i discovered that it was adjustable . problem solved . the surface is non slip and rubbery so even my bare feet are comfortable on it . the tilt is adjustable too which is good . it s not aesthetically appealing but it sits under your desk so who s going to see it ? it s a very nice product and i recommend it to anyone who is height challenged .this is an amazing foot rest . it was easy to set up and changed my situation immediately . while my feet are on this my posture in the chair is improved by sitting all the way back in the seat . i am tall while wearing heels and most office chairs need a lot of adjustment before i can use them . then of course the desk is too high . it took very little setup to put this foot rest to use under my kitchen table which is currently functioning as my office . my office is a mess of work to do and i don t like going in there . it s dangerous . i changed the height setting to the higher setting by unscrewing two thumbscrews and then tightening them and tilting the rest to the angle i like . it was an extremely easy set up .this product makes an immediate difference in the way i sit in my office chair . sitting in the chair incorrectly causes me some lower back pain and neck pain so i try to correct myself whenever i notice it . for some reason it has always been more comfortable for me to sit on the front half of my seat leaving the back half of my chair available for all kinds of pranks and incidences . on an extremely highly polished floor in a classroom my chair once shot out behind me . the worst indignity ? i could have gotten over falling but hitting my chin on my desk and falling on my butt . . .not a good day . and it added to my reputation for being a clutz not that i needed any help . all in all it s probably much safer to properly sit in a chair .the immediate consequence of this foot rest was that i have been much more comfortable sitting at work for long days . my lower back does not hurt and i have not had to get up constantly to walk around or play with my hula hoop . while i am working i am playing around tipping the angle back and forth toes and heels toes and heels which also provides some entertainment .this is heavy and sturdy and seemed like it would stay in place . its only flaw that it does not have non skid below it . this foot rest does shift on wooden floors . my solution for this minor problem was to put a piece of carpet non skid below it . that worked .yes it is still under my kitchen table and it annoys everyone but me . they are currently working on making it fit under my desk because it is about half an inch too wide . in the meantime i am perfectly happy with it . 
i needed this kit for testing my newly cycling aquariums . i had bought the quick strips from the local pet store but they were not accurate and didn t test as close of a range as this kit did . i found this on amazon for about half off of where everyone else was selling it .it shipped extremely fast and works amazingly . i don t know what i would do without it and i will never use the dip strips again .this come with all the solutions plus test tubes and instructions a very good price it is cheaper to by the whole kit then separate solutions test tubes so when i run out i will just buy an entire kit . very easy to understand love it ! ! !should had read the other reviews before ordering .upon opening my package i found a filter cartridge set that did not even remotely resemble what i ordered or the ones in the picture . instead i received carbon floss filter cartridges which are tube like and small . how does someone mix that up ? i could have just picked up the filters at the store but now i need to repackage the item go to the post office and then to the store anyway not going to order these here again . bad service .
black tortex picks with silver lettering .the jazz picks are about smaller than standard tortex picks and have a more pronounced point .the pick holder work as described . i have not used the adhesive to attach the pick holder to my guitar yet but it stays attached to the head piece by sliding it between strings from the tuning pegs on the head piece . it is only sized for a standard size guitar pick so if you use small picks or large picks it will not hold your pick . it works well for standard guitar picks and will hold or picks if you like different thickness picks you can have a variety of picks that will store on the guitar or other pick instrument .i had no reference point to judge the size of these picks perhaps compare pick with a quarter in the shot as a sizing method .good picks though .

perfect for washing the rv . . .strong pole you can scrub as high as you need to go or can leverage . holds its position when set . very pleased .pros as described heavy duty well madecons have not used it yetlooks heavy duty and easy to use . have not had to use it yet so can not say how durable it will be .it is one of those safe guards for my harley sportster now if i have a flat i can fix it .i use stoner s invisible glass strictly when detailing cars others or my own . it doesn t streak and applies well . it s alcohol based so its safe for window tint unlike ammonia based products such as windex . unlike other stoner s products it can be purchased in a traditional spray bottle rather than a pressurized can . great product !
these discs work well with avent products . they also fit in my lansinoh bottles .while these discs will still fit on the top of an avent natural bottle and hold a seal they don t fit snugly in the nipple hole like they do with avent classic bottles . so milk won t leak or spill but when you unscrew the ring you have two pieces to mess with . unfortunately i wasn t able to find a sealing disc for the natural bottles hopefully they re coming soon !update i did however learn that the rings forphilips avent bpa free classic bottle screw rings packfit on avent natural bottles so i just ordered some rings and now the seal fits nicely in the ring on my natural bottles ! !these work great for the evenflo bottles . affordable and they fit well so the bottles vent but don t leak . my daughter had no issues with these nipples .
this is a great guitar cable its very long and does not get tangles up no matter how hard you try i recommend it to anybody who wants a good cable .nice bag padding it good i just wish the hooks weren t plastic not shore how long they will last i have tried many string cleaners and so far this one is as good as any . i like the applicator and will just need to see how long it lasts .
playtex cups are the best ones on the market . everything they make is interchangeable which is very budget friendly . the valves tend to accidentally go into the garbage disposal or disappear in the dishwasher because they are clear . the replacement package is essential but are not easy to find in stores .i bought this item at a local specialty store and the clerk assured me the item was bpa free . when i got it home and opened it i saw the dreaded recycle code on the white part . i contacted baby bjorn to clarify . here is what they said babybj ouml rn and plastic safety when it comes to the material used in the production of our products we put significant effort into finding materials that meet our high standards of quality and safety . to guarantee the safety of our plastic products all babybj ouml rn kitchen and bathroom products are tested by specialized technology resources str an independent global provider of quality assurance testing . all plastics used in the production of our kitchen products fulfill the demands of the european eec and the american fda standard for plastics and are classified as food safe . through testing all of our kitchen products have been designated pvc free phthalates free and lead free . recent studies by health organizations such as the national institute of health have raised concerns about the safety ofbisphenol a bpa in plastic products . bpa is an industrial chemical that is used to manufacture polycarbonate plastic .polycarbonate plastic is the plastic that has caused considerable recent controversy because of its use in baby bottlemanufacturing and because it has been proven to leach bpa . polycarbonate plastic is not used in the production of any babybj ouml rn baby products and all babybj ouml rn products with a plastic component are bpa free . more specifically the babybj ouml rn plate is made of abs acrylonitrile butadiene styrene plastic which is certified bpafree . while both polycarbonate and abs along with other plastics have a recycling designation of there is no knownhealth risk associated with abs . i decided to keep it and see how it goes even though i prefer using glass or stainless steel items . i like that this one is not made in china like so many things tend to be .i was hesitant to buy these because of the price for little pieces of plastic but they are a must ! the avent system makes life so much easier and these discs are part of that !
this stapler gave me about months of good use and then it started to malfunction badly . i tried everything and finally threw it in the garbage after months . rediculouswhenever my classroom pen starts to fade and it takes a while a new one is a joy to use . a pack of these lasts me a couple of school years .we use these in our training sessions and no one has complained about a pen not working during the week long session . . .
have stored both cat food and dog food in these and they do not seem to let air in . do what they are supposed to do .the dog loves this stuff !pros pricedog loves the taste you can even trick her to eat normal dry food by putting some of this on it cons the dispenser will shoot the fish oil all over the place ! ! ! ! ! so press gently ! ! !this was perfect to hold my dogs pounds of dry dog food . you can put the wheels on or leave them off . it s always nice to have an option .
this half fold style along with avery s quarter fold heavy paper stock is the perfect medium to use for those who prefer to send personalized greeting cards . sure you can use standard printer paper but these scored sheets are whiter brighter and make the colors and text pop and it gives your cards that you worked long and hard on that professional look . these packages all come with matching envelopes which make it a great deal . i don t go out and spend . per card for those generic cards you get at drug stores anymore . . . . . . . that s ridiculous . i love designing and personalizing the cards i send out at a fraction of the cost .these business cards are heavy bright white and truly look unperforated when clicked apart . they should take ink very well and you ll be able to make some decent looking cards with them if you know what you are doing . avery provides assistance with a number of templates or you can design them yourself if you re good with graphic design and typography .i was a bit disappointed when my box of cards arrived for review however because one side had been crushed in shipping . the two sided printing feature was what i was most interested in testing with these cards because i often need to custom print a few mini brochure business cards in addition to my regular two sided four color cards . there was no way those crumpled sheets were going to go through my printer without jamming so i decided to use them to make business card holders for small table signs . search the instructables site for simple business card iphone ipod stand . they are stiff enough for that purpose so i ll get good use from them . and i ll buy them in the future too when i need custom business cards because they are a quite handy product .my wife needed some cards for recipes and we ordered these since there was a discount on the box . the cards are good quality card stock and we can print three recipe cards per page .with a little work on the computer you can add just about anything you want on the cards and the bakers and cookers will thank you time and time again . by adding some color you can make those plain white cards into a very nice recipe card .
work great for my john deere x this was a fraction of the price of the ones at the store and fit perfectly for my lexus rx awd . mm is the correct size for my jetta tdi oil cap and this fits perfectly .it s also fairly low profile another plus .
this potty is very nice . i bought this because of the sleek look high back . it will work fine . my daughter turns yrs old soon i will then try her on it if she is ready .i almost bought one of those hook on chairs that just hook right onto the table but they didn t seem as useful because you couldn t use them freestanding . my son sits in something similar to this at daycare for his meals and i decided to pick one up for when we visit grandma restaurants friend s houses that no longer or don t yet have small children and a booster or highchair available . this booster is great . easy to clean folds up fairly compact will hold up to lbs . not that my son will ever reach the weight limit before he s in a regular chair but i did not want this outgrown in a year . i m not sure why it has the tray cover but the removable insert middle with the cup holder is nice . not necessary but nice . my son can eat off of either tray and we can even switch them out mid meal if we want to serve something else . highly recommended . i like this more than my regular highchair .update my son is now months . we finally got rid of our full sized high chair and now we just have this . it s been so easy to clean travel with and use as a booster . i will not bother with a full sized high chair ever again . i wish i would have just bought this and saved my money !i had bought this right before we moved ways across the world . it was perfect . we were able to fit out chicco keyfit and teh graco turbo booster in this bag . it turned out that we needed an extra bag so i took the carseat out and replaced it with the first years reclining booster seat for eating a boppy and some clothes and had a ton of room . for the price it did exactly what it was supposed to do . the only thing that would make this product better is to have wheels and a handle .
i prefer canister filters but this is a great hob filter if you don t like canisters . i use this on my gallon half moon tank and it keep it clean .i am running an aquaclear on a gallon heavily planted tank . the filter is very very quiet . it does not give the kind of water cleaning and polishing that a canister filter would give but for the price its a nice choice . i have used this line of aquaclear filters on nearly a dozen different freshwater tanks for the last decade . . . they are my favorite hang on back filters .this is the first time i have not upgraded a filter in other words normally i would have gotten an aquaclear or for a gallon aquarium but for this tank i just wanted some water circulation . the tank is very lightly stocked and the plants do most of the filtering . if you are setting up a standard tank i would recommend upgrading the filter so you have nearly double the filter capacity on your tank . ie so you have a filter for a gallon tank on a gallon tank a filter for a gallon tank on a gallon tank etc . it makes for healthier fish and less maintenance .i have a prefilter pre filter sponge pack for fluval edge aquarium on the aquaclear to keep the cherry shrimp and fry from getting sucked up into the filter . the prefilter fits on the uptake tube perfectly and is working as it should .i recently ran an aquaclear and an aquaclear on a gallon tank . both of those filters were much louder than this little aquaclear . i m guessing that the more powerful the motor is the louder the filter is . i did try the trick of swabbing silicon grease on the impeller shaft and both of those two larger filters were still too loud for me . i am now running a canister filter on that tank and am very happy with it .i ve also tried the updated version of the aquaclear line thefluval c power filter . i did not like that filter as much as the old aquaclears . the fluval was not any quieter and there was so much hardware in the filter box that it really forced you to use only their filter media . one of the great things about the aquaclears is that you can put in just about anything you want in the filter box like peat moss or ammorocks or whatever your heart desires . i like that flexibility .as much as i like the aquaclears though i leave them behind for canister filters when the tank is any more than gallons . hang on back filters are ok but for a big tank or for any tank that needs top notch water quality give me a canister filter .i use this for a gallon as my hob filter and a gallon under gravel filter and between the two the water stays crystal .
they do work . exactly as advertised . hane no fear on buying these . fit the chevy silverado wt tailgate rods .works great . fairly easy swap . just be aware the front window regulators are the same on whether you have a suburban or tahoe or one of their gm family members . not so for the rear regulators . the full size suvs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones . the vehicle input feature amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference . the pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at but the vehicle id feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit . beware ! ! ! ! just so you know the dorman and fit the full size and the and fit the tahoe size vehicles .works just like it needs to . perfect fit for the tailgate on my chevy when the oem clip busted .
playtex cups are the best ones on the market . everything they make is interchangeable which is very budget friendly . the valves tend to accidentally go into the garbage disposal or disappear in the dishwasher because they are clear . the replacement package is essential but are not easy to find in stores .they are easy to use but hard to see the numbers once in the closet . i think i would have been better off with the ones where the dividers show on the sidethese locks are awesome . we slid them into the folding spots on my preschooler s closet doors . the photo is misleading and makes it look like they lock in the middle between the doors but they actually slide into place where the doors fold so make sure to order two .
i have a home studio and needed extra cables for my three guitars and keyboard . i wanted to have them all plugged in and ready to go without having to switch cables all the time . so i tried this cable and it works perfectly . very heavy cord and top quality construction . can t beat the price either . will buy again .bought this to replace my ft mice cable . now i have plenty of cable to set up anyway i want .after suffering through crackles lost signals and all the rest i decided to heed the numerous positive reviews of the spectraflex tweed cable and purchase one through amazon .com . because the new acoustic electric classical i received as a gift has an end pin outlet i bought the spectraflex with the right angle connector . although i have been using the cable for only a few weeks i am very impressed . the connections on all the guitars and basses on which i ve used it are sure with no loss of signal no crackles . perhaps most impressive is the fact that i can turn the right angle connector around and never have any change of signal . finally i can be confident that when i play something will consistently come out of the amplifier . by the way the old school tweed look is a plus too .
i love lynx products these caps fit properly and do what they are supposed to do . i would buy again .i wish there was a guide somewhere that shows you what cars these sunshades fit . i bought this one super jumbo for my toyota camry hoping it would fit . well it did not fit . i had to return it and order the regular jumbo sunshade . the regular jumbo sunshade fits the windshield like a glove . quality is good and it folds up to about . so if you have a toyota camry do not buy this one ! ! ! order the regular jumbo size .amazon can you please look into getting some sort of reference guide that will show customers the correct vehicle application ? this would make buying this product a whole lot easier .cpsthese were a very hight quality product and i received them very quickly thank you amazon . i ordered three to use for a disconnect system on my scooter they worked great . i cut them in half and connected them into my lighting system so i could remove the seat frame and the trunk easily .
we bought this for about bucks and got sage lined wicker baskets to fit within it for organization . great table that does the trick . fits almost everything we need for clothes and we have a diaper depot hanging off the side to fit all the changing table items . i am sure the product would be great . . . when it fits the table . this did not fit my kitchen table nor any other table that we needed it to fit .very space saver and affordable ! i stacked for newborn size diapers and size diapers and it fits perfectly even when i pull one diaper at a time the other diapers don t slide through it . i can t believe how inexpensive this item is that comes with a great quality . it fits very sturdy at the side of savannah shore changing dresser table . definitely recommend this item if you don t have enough space in your nursery ! ! ! !
title says it all .i bought two of these . to compare i put them side by side with slight spacing in my gallon aquarium . these little babies were telling me that i had a degree difference withing an inch of space .do you fish invertebrates a favor buy another thermometer .i don t work for seachem but i should because i swear by the company s products . i run a canister filter on my gallon bow front corner aquarium which most people say is crazy . however with purigen and matrix my numbers are perfect and my tank is pristine .i have this and the fluval c in a gal tank and i must say i like them both . however i give a slight edge to the fluval only because i like the way the media is stored . the fluval s media is stored in individual vertical cartridges whereas the aquaclear s media is layered on top of each other . when it s time for cleaning or changing media the fluval is just more convenient . i think there both good filters . watch some video reviews on both if you re not sure . heck one reviewer even compares the filters . i don t think you can go wrong with either one . just my .
bought these picks for the impending strat i ll buy already have sets of fender strings i will be ready !what was it brillcream ? a dab will do ya ?something like that this is all you need for contact cleaning . worth the coin .this pedal was purchased to replace an oem pedal for my synthesizer it works as expected and has proven to be durable . i don t hesitate to drop it in my gig bag knowing it will be ready to rock and roll at the next show .
get the large one it s not too large but an appropriate size i would assume after receiving the large one that the small one is quite small . i have a lbs cocker spaniel mix and he loves treats . the quality is great and i have seen at pet stores at a very costly i price .these are mini and good for small dogs but i should have noticed how small since i have a larger dog .i have a medium size dog and it s really just too big for him . if you have a great dane large golden retriever or something that likes to play tug this will be good for you . i have a sort of a beagle rotweiler looking mix and it s just too big for his jaw .
i used to get marketing calls almost every day with calls in the months leading up to the holidays hitting my phone both in the morning and evening .finally i had enough of the marketing call hassle and decided to fight back . i put a telezzapper on my christmas quot wish list quot and received one as a gift . i was a little skeptical about the thing and wasn t really sure if it would work but a few days after getting the unit the telezapper was on my phone line and i was waiting for the first telemarketer call to arrive to get zapped . i was also waiting to see if it would zap my dsl connection since it s on the same phone line .i didn t have to wait very long . the phone rang i picked up the receiver and in about a second i heard the tri tone signal and then said hello . . . the line was silent . i called out again and got no response . i just zapped my first telemarketer and it was great !i booted up my computer to test my dsl line and it didn t skip a beat . i also checked my caller id and it still registered numbers .finally something that actually seems to work !a few things to note re record your message machine to allow a second gap at the beginning so that the telezapper can beep and not garble the beginning of your message . tell your friends about the device on your phone and tell them not to hang up when they hear the tones . some of my friends just thought they got a wrong number and hung up to try again . if you re not expecting any calls you may want the call to go to your answering machine first to get zapped and then pick up after you re sure there s a voice at the other end of the line . if you pick up the receiver before your answering machine picks up wait for the tones to go off before putting the receiver to your ear the tones are loud .overall this is a great little unit and it really does work with my marketing calls dropping by at least .the next thing i need to do is to place the telezapper on my nd line my fax line to get rid of all those junk faxes !works like a champ ! ! i m having a lot of trouble with nonprofit groups calling to fundraise . repeated calls to their membership offices yielded no relief and i hate to simply not give money to worthy causes in order to stop their dial a beggars . i still will give money but i had one group calling me eight times a day ! enough ! ! what s worse is that a lot of these groups also raise money by selling the names and addresses of their donors to similar groups so you really wind up getting a lot of calls .i got my telezapper for around installed it four days ago and believe me it is already paying off . a dozen calls a day from the dreaded toll free number or out of area callers have now dwindled to nearly zero . i use caller id with mine as well so hopefully i d be able to simply return a call from an organization i actually would want to speak to .i m leaving off one star because my zapper is loud when you pick up the phone it emits those three tones that are at the beginning of most phone company we re sorry you have reached a number that has been disconnected recordings and if you re not careful to wait a second or two before putting it to your ear it ll blow your mind . there may be some way to turn it down though . it d be swell if you could simply press a switch to make it do its thing instead of having to listen to the tones on every call but it s a small price to pay for freedom from incessant number calls .i ll tell you this i ll not be without one of these gizmos again . i couldn t find any other workable options my phone company won t allow customers to block calls on an individual basis . now i can read a book or watch a program without being interrupted by fundraisers . thanks telezapper ! let me know when you guys develop a program that ll get me off the mailing lists of all the solicitors too . . . we have the uniden cordless phone and recently had some problems with the battery lasting less than a day on a charge . consequently i tried to call customer service however uniden only offers email customer service . i finally found a texas number for them where one has to pay to call themthis is a far cry from panasonic or sony which both offer free toll free support . apparently uniden is too cheap to offer a toll free support number and they want you to pay for the phone call . to add insult to injury when i did finally call their pay support number i had to wait twenty minutes for someone to answer . simply pathetic . i would avoid this company . apparently uniden does not want to put any money towards customers so why should customers pay for their phones ?
i have this paired with the behringer c studio condenser microphone . it matches the mic well color wise and fit . the c fits the mount perfectly . i recommend this mount highly .http www .amazon .com behringer c studio condenser microphone dp b cz rlk ref sr ?ie utf qid sr keywords behringer c al ser el producto fender original se ve que es robusto . . y con una buen duravilidad . . hoy lo instalare . . saludos desde venezuela ! !the yamaha guitalele sounds absolutely beautiful . it s like a mini classical guitar except the recommended tuning is a d g c e a a d followed by the standard g c e a tuning on a string ukulele but it can also be turned to e a d g b e standard tuning on a guitar .on the standard tuning for a guitar however the strings sound a little floppy . a reviewer suggested using an extra hard high tension string like thed addario extra hard tension classical guitar stringsto get around the floppiness on the e a d g b e turning . you can use a capo with this instrument . mykyser capoworks on it just fine .the guitalele measures x x at their widest points . the construction quality on my copy is tiptop except for a minute area where the neck meets the soundboard which is lighter in color because it missed an application of wood stain not a big deal really . the guitalele has a satin non glossy finish which is a lot less prone to the unsightly scratches a high gloss finish might incur .the package includes a black nylon gig bag .for a high quality instrument that costs a tiny fraction of the price for a full size guitar the yamaha guitalele gl is a good buy just under a ninety as of this writing .
the multipurpose copy paper works well the the printer .my family and i are enjoying both the printer and the paper .use with canon printer and canon inks for outstanding color prints . have compared canon to other papers and canon papers always is my choice .pros small footprint relatively quiet good quality printouts uses the hp a cartridge this size cartridge is rated for pages vs hp successor cartridges for personal laser printers eg hp a cartridge which is rated for pages refurbished toner cartridges are widely available cons no windows drivers compared to my previous printer samsung ml the prints a lot slower especially noticeable with multi page pdf documents in conclusion this is a good little printer for light occasional use .
i just received these and i m really disappointed . number one they are made in pakistan . number two they are incredibly thin . i keep looking at the package and it says there are in there but it s hard to believe . these are going back .these are excellent . i bought some cheap ones and they are no where near as nice as these i love minei got these thinking they were the same size as other brands size small . . boy was i wrong they are smaller than extra small sizes in other brands . . so buyer bewear ! but they are good shelds they work good and stay in place .
these d addario medium acoustic guitar strings come as individually packaged sets of three with the necessary six strings in each set . being new to guitars we had no idea how often the strings would need to be replaced so this three pack seemed like a good starting point .the strings are good quality produce accurate tones according to our auto tuner and have held up well .highly recommendedcfhexcellent steel guitar strings each string has a color coded end each string bag has three bundles of two strings which makes it even easier to figure out which string goes where . purchased a set box and each box was in a seperate sealed bag for freshness . i went with the mediums . try the light if you are a beginner .this tuner is wonderful . you can tune all strings in same time . it s halpfull in stage because you don t need to test each string individually .
i ve bought this product with another brand of so called micro mesh bag . don t do that . the beads are very tiny and come through drawstring bag . draw string bags are in my eyes for carbon or any other heavier media . i now only buy this product in the manufactured pre measured micro mesh bag in ml . these bags are welded which is amazing . so nothing gets throught these bags . i use two in my gal . i love that you can regenerate the purigen beads . you can only regenerate them a handful of times i ve regenerated them times so far but you will get your moneys worth . i buy about bags of the ml to not have any downtime for filtration . i highly recommend those product for any fish enthusiast .i have these in an outdoor rubbermaid storage box . the iris airtight pet food container means i have double the protection for my lb . bags of dry dog food . after years of use i ve never had a problem with my dog food being kept safe from the elements . i do lock the outer storage box lid . i did not put the caster wheels on the container which makes it fit in the outdoor storage box perfectly . an awesome product that i recommend as perfect . i don t understand why others say that their dog food bags do not fit . i am buying standard dog food bags from petco and there is still room enough to store what little is left of the last bag which is about empty .this locks well but is easy for a person to open . it holds about medium sized bags of kibble or one of those enormous bags . i m pleased with the purchase .
we wanted to print to finish like what you would get from a school picture photographer and this was it . definitely not glossy but one step above white paper matt finish .the matte paper is ok but i would purchase glossy paper for a sharper imagethis is your standard matte finish office tape . it works just fine clear and matte not shiny . dispenser dispenses appropriately . nice to have on hand .
this gate has been great for the doorway to a room that we are in and out of constantly . i initially purchased thesummer infant sure and secure extra tall walk thru gate white but i had trouble with the latch staying closed not something you want with an ambitious baby around ! sure it is more difficult to step over this gate but it will never come unlocked to allow a child to break loose . it is easy to take down anytime you need with one hand easy to carry around and the plastic does not mar the door frame or paint on the wall i lean it against for storage when not in use . the gate can be left on the door frame when the door is closed .for us the summer infant door will not close with the gate up lever handle not a knob on the door so for naptime and bedtime the gate had to be taken off . this involves unscrewing all four pressure mount posts using two hands to carry the gate one on the door part one on the frame and finding a place to put it where the metal would not damage walls or furniture . i think it would be more appropriate for a place where removal was not often necessary . and the noise ! a baby grabbing the bars and shaking can make quite a racket !we purchased this gate for the top of the stairs . we live in a townhouse and have an unusal stairwell i suppose . installing this gate was a great pain ! we could not find a stud in the wall to match up with the areas we would need to install it at and had to purchase toggle bolts to better secure the gate into the wall . . . .so a toddler putting lots of force on it would not rip the gate and the drywall out thus tumbling down the stairs . also we have molding and while the gate does come with extenders to work around over the molding it didnt work for us . we had to install the gate above the molding thus leaving a to inch gap from the floor to the gate . this is bad ! our daughter has tried to squeeze her way under the gate to get down the stiars and almost managed to do this feet first . luckily i am never out of view of her upstairs nor not upstairs with her small townhouse ! and only purchased it for the safety of knowing she wont lose her balance at the top of the stairs . i have only used this gate for a top of stair gate so i have nothing else to compare it to . hopefully it is only that i live in an oddly shaped home and it works great for most other folks .note it does take a lot of measuring up and making sure that every point matches up perfectly or the gate will not operate properly or smoothly . i do however like the top lift bar to open the gate and it is easy to unlock and lock back into place with two button ontop the lift bar handle . while i still had problems using it as a top of stair gate i do think it would work very well as a doorway gate .i have a medal banister on my stairs and have been having a lot of trouble getting a gate to fit . the kidco gate in combination with the y spindle has given me a safe and secure option for the bottom of my stairs .
i put two pickups in my resonator guitar a magnetic and a transducer . this is the imd improvised musical device solution to using both pickups without building a little box with two volume controls . i plug two cords into the mixer one from each pickup and blend and balance the two pickups . it works . it cost a a little more than buying the parts to build something like an electric guitar wiring setup but it works out of the box so the labor cost is almost zero . bonus it s an active device so it can boost the signal . only con is that it runs on v and doesn t have a battery option . i can live with that .i installed this in a super champ x . as others have pointed out you ll have to turn the treble down after installing it . that s because it s designed for making solos stand out . i .e . for adding punch . if you re a lead guitarist this speaker will make your guitar sing .however if you mostly play rhythm i d stick with the stock speaker .i want to put two of these into my x blues deville to increase its range and make solos sing while letting the stock speakers give me some bottom .what a great little gizmo . i play both acoustic and electric guitar at my church and there is only one input on the board for me . no more unplugging plugging in between songs . just a push on the pedal and i m switching noiselessly between guitars . i can also adjust the input level for each guitar as well .
this does not only protect but cleans stains road film etc . off the paint and bring its to nice clean shine . my cars have ranged from light colours white and silver to darker colours red and blue and this works perfectly to clean and protect . sometimes depending on how dirty the paint was applications would be done to restore the finish . safe on clear coats and glass this is perfect . also one heavy shower does not remove the wax . give it a try .first off don t get turned off by the name yellow is the color of the stuff it won t turn your paint yellow ! it does look great on yellow paint though also reds and darker colors like dark blue and black . for lighter colors you are better off going with something else collinite is a great choice .pros drippy wet looks . you ll want to grab a towel and dry your paint its that wet ! decent durability approx months on a car parked outdoors fills in minor swirling leaves paint nice and slickcons stains trim rubber black plastic needs to be applied very thin otherwise it can be hard to take off can streak if used on a hot surface or if too much is usedoverall this is a great wax that has been around for a very long time because it looks so great . its a total steal at the price .used this to clean the vinyl in the interior of a corvette that was supposed to be charcoal but had developed a chalky white nasty residue since delivered new from bowling green . this cleaner sprayed on to a microfiber towel removed all of it very easily and the best part is that it left no residue on the vinyl . it is alcohol based so don t spray it all over the place inside the car spray on towel then clean . i then applied a coat of meguiars protectant natural shine with a sponge and wiped excess and the color is now a low luster no gloss charcoal that is beautiful as it was intended .
this expandable file is sturdy and well constructed . it is a perfect size for letter size documents . it is not recommended for legal size documents . they are inches long and will have to be folded to fit . use the longer version of the expanding file for those . back to the matter at hand . . .this file will hold hundreds of pages . it seems quite durable and should last quite a while .these are great if you have a large quantity of papers . they are good for in boxes or outboxes and can accommodate large envelopes or large stacks of papers where others won t .i do a lot of scrapbooking and am always looking for good sheet protectors that are acid free and archival safe . these are the clear version . they are very thick i can hold one up in one hand and it almost stands straight up without flapping over . they have three reinforced holes on the side to put in a binder and a notch at both the top and bottom so the page turns easier . i use x paper or i cut down paper to insert in the sheet protector . the pre cut paper has approximately inch wiggling room . when i cut down a larger piece of paper like a x to fit into an x sheet protector sometimes ok lots of times it doesn t fit so i have to re cut it . with these sheet protectors even if i cut the piece a tad bigger it will still go into the sheet protector yay ! . the pages do not cling to the sheet protector when i m trying to put them in . i also use heavy weight paper back to back and it works great in these sheet protectors .i think these heavy weight sheet protectors are the best of the best . i have others that that light weight and a tad narrower so the page has to be squeezed in or re cut . i don t know what other good stuff to say about them i ll check back in years to let you know if they really are archival safe lol .
i love this filter so much i put one on every tank . i use it in conjunction with my other filters as a daily filter and should i need to i can place the polishing unit in it to give the water that extra clear appearance or to rid the tank of parasites should that ever occur .i took one and cut it in half for a pre filter cover . i use it for an actual insert to the filter if you don t use the carbon add another filter foam and you have another sponge ready to go and cycle another tank . these have many uses ! yes i recommend i put this in a gallon tank which uses a mechanical filer with carbon filter . so i put this pouch right next to the carbon filter with the hopes of having a clearer water .well it s been about a week and i don t see any difference . things could change but i don t see any indication of hope for now .maybe i m using the wrong kind of filter ? updatethis product works . i don t know what i was doing wrong in the previous setting but i bought another bag to substitute the carbons my fluval filter has two compartments for carbon bags . the water is as clean as when used carbon bags and i don t need to buy any more carbon bags anymore . if you have doubts about this product like me remove carbon completely and you will see the difference .
fits my low clearance mazda that comes with alloy wheels and inches of clearance between the inside of the tire and the suspension . have not tried it in the snow yet .when i stepped up to a foot fifth wheel trailer my standard chocks looked undersized against the trailer wheels . these fit the bill . nice and strong .i bought this steering wheel cover to hide the peeling leather on my jeep grand cherokee limited steering wheel . i measured the inside dimensions of the wheel . i did not have to heat or stretch the new wheel cover it fit perfectly and looks great . it s also much easier to keep clean with interior protectant .
does what it does and has what it said .works good so far .buy it when you can have compatible staplersmaybe i overlooked the information but you can t use just any regular headset or earphones with this unit . you have to purchase the panasonic kx tca headset . the unit does not come with the optional headset and the two models they did this in the instruction guide are discontinued . i purchased this phone particularly for the hands free feature it will be useful if they pointed out that only a specified headset works with the phone .this phone is being used in a small business and has so far been working very well . set up is extremely easy did it without the manual . the sound is crisp and clear . one of the features i enjoy most is the fact that you can use certain features on the handset as well as the base . last but not least . . . .that wonderful feature . . . the do not disturb button . . .great for telemarketers and phone stalkers .
not sure why most bulbs are sold in single packages but these light bulbs fit my gallon aquarium hood perfectly .i use this in conjunction with the zoo med turtle tuff splashproof halogen lamp watts . it clamps on the side of the tank and works great .this watt heater is safe up to about inches from the surface for birds . on the surface of the heater the temperature as i have measured it a dozen times averages to degrees . warmth is noticeable two feet away with the heat emitter . i use it in a silver dome hood that one can find for work lights . this heat emitter is as good as one can possibly expect for just watts of power use . with an inverter it can even work off a car battery for a couple of hours .
these are really nice for our dell monitors . the wider monitors really need the wider platform for stability and to not look funny .that being said these are very durable for plastic construction offer adjustments of the feet and allow storage space under the monitor which would otherwise be dead space .very well made robust .i use it for tying up my heavy duty cords in the garage where extra width is a plus .this is a quality dispenser and the tape included makes for a nice package . heavy base and tractive rubber bottom for serious staying power when pulling tape .
i didn t have a large enough sink to initially bathe my son inside of so we opted for buying a portable tub . i must say this was the easiest way of bathing a newborn baby ! i love that it comes with a little hammock so that they little ones that can not support themselves up can rest and relax in the tub . i also love the little shelf where you can put your products inside so that they re not all scattered around when you need them . we ve even taken this tub for when we go out of town and it s just so convenient . my son is now months old and he still loves taking a bath in this . he gets really excited for bath time and i honestly think it s because of how comfortable this tub is . i highly recommend it !my mother in law bought this bath for us to use when we were visiting and staying at her house . immediately after placing my daughter in it i wished i had gotten this bath instead of the one i had . i didn t use this bath until my daughter had outgrown their bathroom sink so i never used the hammock but i attached it to see how it would work and i can see how perfect it would be . i love that babies can lounge in it when they are younger and then sit up straight at the other end of the tub as they grow . the tub is very deep and roomy . when i have another baby i will definitely be getting this tub for myself .i used this with my first child until he could sit up without wobbling . however with my second child i only used it for about the first month . the sling is the best part it cradles the baby so that you can easily wash the child by yourself . i stopped using it with my second child because i was already filling the tub for one child so i just figured it was easier to bathe them together . now i am using a seat that a friend gave me a that supports the baby in the tub so once again i am pretty much hands free .
fits all of my cords even my apple cords perfectly . works exactly as advertised .nice product works as described .works well and as expected
this is one of those products that you hope you never have to use or take advantage of . but it s a great idea that more manufacturers should get involved with .azoo also offers a similar battery backup unit for about plus they have a self contained ac battery combo pump for continuous use which recharges its volt battery priced at about .one reviewer complained that the power cord didn t work and that his unit only functioned with battery power . news flash ! ! that s the way it s supposed to work ! ! this is a battery backup unit ! !the way it works is simple ac power holds a relay open . when ac power fails the relay closes and completes the battery circuit to power the pump . the power cord serves only to keep the relay open not to power the pump .unlike as in other reviews here the unit i have isn t all that noisy maybe it s a new model . the one thing i don t like about it is a stupidly short power cord only inches ! ! not good for mounting more than inches or so away from the aquarium or high on a wall to prevent backflow . make sure you install a check valve in the air line . also you should know the included air line is way too short .recommended for emergency use . stars . .this is exactly the same extension tube included with my aquaclear power filter .if you have a tall aquarium and you want the intake near buttom i highly recommend this extension tube .i bought this after many people suggested it for the sole purpose of gas exchange in my saltwater tank after a power outage . granted i have no open outlets for this to actually work as intended the pump is off when plugged into a live outlet and only turns on when ac power is lost but manually turning this on during the last power outage worked like a charm . cheap reliable safety item imo .

i download a lot of sheet music for reviewing and for sharing with some of my piano students . i want to preserve the music and am putting together binders using the sheet protectors to put the music pages back to back . these sheet protectors are heavy weight enough to be very durable but they are also crystal clear for easy reading and allow for easy page turns while playing . ink from the printed pages does not stick to these protectors and they are acid free . i think they ll be great for my project !this book holder is made of plastic and seems a little flimsy but so far it s holding up decently . the back stand uses two pieces and is adjustable . there are two tabs in the front which you can move forward and backward so that you can turn pages more easily or insert new books without fear of ruining a page . they are also a problem . i have found that they can pop out from use as they only have a fitted notch keeping them in place at the bottom of the unit .i can also see how a book larger than inches in thickness can be an issue as the depth of the base is roughly an inch deep . i ve not yet had to work with this i use it for typing up class notes from notebooks at this time with a book of that size but i can picture my coffee cup coming into play if i ever use it with a book of that size .i bought this in order to be able to prop heavy books in front of me on a table and also for use as a tabletop music stand on the occasions when i don t use a regular floor music stand .the item is well made of heavy weight wire which is to say round metal rods bent precisely . it folds flat and can be easily stowed either flat or hung from a hook . folded the dimensions are x x . unfolded and ready for action the space between the two holders is . the arms that extend upward to hold the pages in place are . these arms therefore do interfere somewhat with the turning of pages . no easy way round that . the spaces to hold the book are only so you can t put a really thick book on this . that is a drawback as you have to consider the entire thickness of the book not just when you are reading in the middle of it . the illustration which i consider a bit deceptive shows what appears to be a dictionary open to its middle . no way could that happen on this stand with my webster college ! also this device holds the material at quite an erect angle that cannot be adjusted . it seems an appropriate angle though .the stand comes with little rubber tips in a plastic bag so you have to put them on the exposed metal tips yourself no biggie . i do suggest a bit of super glue having lost plenty of these protective tips over time .
i prefer the ventaire bottles with the wider nipple bases . these nipple bases are really narrow . if you are looking for nipples that are likely better for breastfed babies i would go with the wider nipples . because of the difference obviously the tops are not interchangeable but the bases between the wider bottles and these thinner bottles are interchangeable . these are easy to use and wash they make my baby less gassy and she can hold the bottle if i need her to . i still prefer the wider bottles though since she is generally breastfed . i have switched to ventaire bottles over the drop ins tommy tippee and avent bottles because i like these the best .these only fit on the older style bottles as they lock in with the lid which on the wide mouth glass bottle is much bigger . the traditional bottles i imagine would be great but these are useless for me unfortunately .this is a nice rack to place bottles on . i use avent bottles for my baby and they fit really well . just wish it was a bit larger to fit more stuff on it especially the nipples which are larger than regular bottle nipples . overall it s nice and i would buy it again .
they are cheap when bought in the pack and they are very quiet . i need to order a couple more packs though !i bought this after buying a red and blue clip on tuner . these are the best tuners for the money . the display is very stable and it s simply fun and easy to use .these are great strings . nice bright tone . the three pack was the best deal when i ordered them . get some !
joyo continues to surprise me . this thing is all metal looks very sleek is true bypass and all around works well .the individual bands actually light up which is pretty cool .the only reason i didn t give it stars was they forgot to drill a hole for the power indicator led left of the footswitch . you can see the led on nearly every other joyo pedal for an idea of how it should look . however it doesn t even show up in the product picture on amazon . it wasn t a big deal i just drilled a little ish hold and it fits through .works as it shoukd better instructions could come with it with a larger size text . also how to open to replace battery as well as the specs on the battery are lacking .i was honestly amazed at how flexible this cord is . i really like the right angle plug for my amp it doesn t make the wire stick out like a straight plug would . good stuff .
bought these because we were using a medela pump and philips bottles . of course the breast pump and bottle industry can t make it easy for everything to work together . these adapters fit great onto the pump and the philips bottles . don t feel forced to buy all new bottles or a brand new pump just to make your system work !we use these for both medela breast pump parts and dr . brown s bottle parts . works flawlessly in the top rack and fits a lot of pieces .these converters worked perfectly with my medela swing breast pump and my medela pump in style . i loved not having to transfer milk from one bottle to another .
these did not fit my suburban the description said w x hook so i assumed that to be included . it wasn t and i was unable to use these on my suburban .i welded a piece of flat stock on the insert for the motorhome . this adapter is for my dodge grand caravan .the p arrived exactly as described but my order was lost for days between the printing of the shipping label and pick up by the p .o . no explaination was given when i contacted the company . other than that i m very satisfied with both the p s function and performance . my only problem was mounting the unit in my tundra . the plug in adaptor which i also purchased mated up perfectly with the pre wired harness included with toyota s optional tow package . older tundras and some of the models came with a pre wired harness about foot long but my was delivered with the new and improved shorter version something to do with safety and is only about inches long . the longer harness coupled with the plug in adaptor allowed mounting the p to the right side of the steering wheel by the center console out of the way . unfortunately some later model tundras like mine have the pre wire harness which restricts mounting the p just to the right of the hood release and directly above the emergency brake pedal . if i m not extreemly careful with my size shoe i inadvertently step on the face of the p when applying the emergency brake . if you leave the mounting screws a little loose you can tilt the p up which gives you a little more clearance between the e brake and the p and all is good . .
this product is great . the shipping was great . so far this has lasted me months and going .i have a yr old dog who get s this with his food days per week on top of his supplement pillandi will definitely buy again in the next days .my dogs need this every month the price was good and it arrived promptly just in time for their treatment .great rabbit food . great ingredients . she loves it it is a great price here and the pound bag lasts for months and months . will buy again !
overall recommend this product . the product fits perfectly and is manufactured with quality .note this product is made in the usait is nice to buy a product that is not designed to break in our plastic society . this is a well made metal product . it is big though but i would buy this product again .made in germany not communist china .good quality . excellent set .prompt shipping . very satisfied .
does what it does and has what it said .works good so far .buy it when you can have compatible staplerswhat more can i say . it s made out of cheap plastic but it does what it s supposed to do and it does it well .it met all my expectations and does what it is supposed to do . easy to operate when put to the task .
i bought this phone after returning an at t . ghz cordless set . i was a little wary because of the poor quality of the at t phone but the reviews on amazon gave me the confidence to try this uniden model .the reviews here are spot on . the phone has excellent range and voice quality and its minor detractors are just that minor . here are my observations pros this system is expandable to handsets including the handset on the base . this gives maximum flexibility in deploying in your home or small office . don t be confused . get the tcx handset . msrp . this is the one that is recommended for provided with this phone i believe amazon recommends some other handset . very good voice quality . clear signal no interference . this was a major detractor for the at t phone . ring tones musical ringers . you also have the ability to set personal ringtones for people in your address book . you can set different ring tones on each handset . up to numbers in your address book . however the phone book and cid system share memory so it s a total of numbers . hm . but each phone book entry can have numbers so you don t have to have multiple name entries for person e .g . mom home mom work . however the multiple entries are not delimited by text so you have to remember which is home and which is work . directlink walkie talkie mode . you can set two phones into direct mode and do a walkie talkie system . however you also have an intercom capability as well . multiple handset conference call capabilities . if you pick up a call on one handset someone else can join in just by turning on a second handset . dropping off is easy . . .just turn off the phone . there s also a privacy mode in each handset that enables you to turn off this function . do not disturb function can be set on the base it will turn off all the ringers on all the handsets . advanced caller id . capable of normal caller id plus call waiting caller id . caller id to phone book . can store a caller s info into the directory . room baby monitor . can listen to the sounds from any room that has a base handset . speakerphone on base and handsets . nice ! customizable handset banners . name them for the room where they belong ! remote access . standard stuff . only a two digit security code though . one key speed dial . set up to speed dial numbers . press the speed dial number and hold and it will bring up the corresponding speed dial entry . it doesn t dial until you re ready just in case you picked the wrong speed dial . normal answering machine features . call screen toll saver etc . i wish it had a dial out notification .cons no dial in remote room monitoring . this would be nice to dial into the system and hear what s going on . phone books and cid shared but not synchronized . you have to copy the phone books from one handset to another instead of it being sync d across all handsets . you also have to delete cid from each individual handset . base display is a little convoluted and confusing . the only way you can see if the answering machine is on off is when it s actually off an icon appears . this was a little confusing . most machines have a little glow light button that turns the machine on or off . you have to do this through the ui . shorter answering machine record time . only minutes up to messages .all in all this is an excellent choice and value .many cute features on this phone include being able to program a name with a specific ringer verbal caller id just says the number or unknown caller different screensavers etc . the range on this phone is excellent and i can hear quite clearly from a distance . also being . ghz it won t interfere with wireless routers and wireless cameras . excellent buy !i am disappointed with the phone and am returning it because sound quality noticeably poor it is tinny to me and folks i call zero consideration of voicemail . this phone has an answering machine if i could buy one that didn t have one i would but you have the ability to turn it off . on or off if you don t use it set the rings to or more so that your voicemail kicks in first and someone leaves a message on voicemail the phone has no way of indicating that there is a voicemail message for you to pick up . the user has to pick up the phone and listen for the stutter dial tone to detect whether there is a voicemail . other phones i ve owned years older have the flexibility to deal with this quite common situation .the phone has good points it has a solid feel to it the volume of the speaker phone is good and the basics like lit keypads and easy to use menus are there .but for me the voice quality a key factor is lacking and the issue of voicemail notification combine to make the phone not one that i would recommend purchasing .
simple and does it s job . but for my use it extends a little too far out . it would be nice if the arm was about the length of the width of a typical lamp housing for those who need the lamp closer to an edge then the center of the terrarium .simply made but not really cheaply made . but they could have put a little more into coating the product as mine has already began to chip from adjusting it s height . would also be nice to have more user friendly and adjustable cable ties anchors .i have a tall birdcage and this makes a great shelf for my birdbath . it is discrete and fits nicely .perfect size easy to clip on jeans or a belt and love the fact you can tighten it or loosen the drawstring easily .
i bought this for our grandson for his st birthday . he loves music and he loves his magic cube . it is easy for him to push and he figured out that each side makes a different sound really quick . it is very sturdy and the music quality is good for a toy . i would recommend it .my triplets who are very different loved these when they were babies . we didn t have the entire set but did have most of the items . this brand and these items are durable bright colored fun wonderful toys so learn with and have loads of fun !my month old is teething and really loves this toy . he can very easily hold it can chew on any part of it and each part has different textures . besides sophie the giraffe this is his new favorite toy !
bad design . . . the two doors that cover the hose and charger cords are not hinged or tethered can easily be misplaced . battery has been overheating during charging and has melted the bottom of the unit . led indicators show low battery charge .i do not trust it . i will keep it as long as the pump works .it does what it is supposed to do that is to increase placement distance from the car to the electrical outletdoes what its supposed to do . it carry s gas from the tank to the hose then on to the rv .
i didn t like the arm through one part and your head through the other so i cut it apart and just hang my uke from my neck and the top of the sound hole . works like a charm . . . . . .is more easily adjusted and the felt lined sound hole clip has not damaged my uke at all .this thing is a little jewel . i have a jazz guitarr oacute n i .e . a modified mexican mariachi guitarr oacute n that is custom strung down to the third e below middle c which is e at . hz . this little tuner does the job . it works clipped onto the head and on the bridge also but a guitarr oacute n bridge is a bit wide for it so clipped directly onto the lower edge of the sound hole i .e . near the the most treble sounding string . there it works perfectly and consistently even on that lowest e and it s entirely out of the way since my right hand is coming at the strings from near the bass most string .bold strummer mentions that it buzzed on his classical guitar and initially i found the same problem but it turned out not to be the tuner s fault but mine . after tuning i had gotten into the habit of turning it face down against the wood of my instrument . when i did that it made just enough contact with the surface of my instrument to create a buzz . it took me two weeks to figure out what was making the buzz since the noise was coming directly out of the sound hole even though i had the tuner clipped to the head at the time . when i realized it was the turner all i had to do was not turn it down against the instrument when i wasn t using it . ever since then no buzz . brilliant huh ? c ?another reviewer s idea about getting two of these so as to keep a spare packed in your gig bag is a great one . at this price why not ? this is a great little item .i bought these to replace the stock machine heads that came on my hondo ii the paul which i bought in . the stock ones were loose lots of backlash in the worm gears and the guitar kept going out of tune even after the strings were fairly stretched out but still new .they went in easily if you follow this hint if your machine head holes do not need to be enlarged disregard this hint the holes for the old machine heads on the hondo ii were . in diameter and these new grovers need a . diameter hole . so i had to find an accurate and clean way of enlarging the holes . it s almost impossible to use a drill even in a drill press without splintering the wood on both surfaces of the headstock . i read online suggestions about using a round wood file and reamer etc . . so what i did was first use a threading tap for metal screw threads which at the bottom had a . diameter and at the top had a . diameter . this is a standard threading tap . i chucked the tap into my battery powered hand drill set to low speed and used the threading tap to cleanly and carefully enlarge the headstock holes to . in diameter . then i used a tapered reamer from both sides to enlarge the holes to the required diameter . quick clean easy . if you have a different size enlargement to make use the appropriately sized taps and a tapered reamer to get the holes to . diameter .another hint which you should follow is to replace only one machine head at a time like when changing strings . you don t want to take the tension off the neck and mess around with the truss rod . at least i don t want to !now the guitar stays in tune and is easier and more accurate to tune .a very worthwhile upgrade ! zero backlash in the worm gears on the grovers beautifully chromed and smooth as silk .

i ve purchased a variety of scratch removing products . many of them worked well but almost all of them left noticeable swirl scratches sometimes worse than the original scratch i m trying to remove especially on high gloss black paint and clear coats . this product works like a charm with minimal swirl scratch marks but suggest you try it on an inconspicuous spot first .removes fine scratches not anything deep into the paint . but gets out minor scrapes and scratches . put a coat of wax on the area after using this product and it will shine beautifully .used this on a black dodge charger with clear coat and the sparkly paint .it did a good job of removing finger nail marks under the door handles and minor scratches where things were dragged over the back bumper to put them in the trunk .it did not harm the clear coat .i would buy this again .
i should have gotten the honda cap . this fits ok but the screws are not captured in the cap . with the original cap the screws cannot fall out . considering the position of the screws when mounting this captured screws are an advantage .very quick and easy mounting and really adds to the look of the rear of the jeep . these are metal and not a cheap plastic and mount with included screws into the existing lens cover screw holes .easy to install . i used my own screws because of the material that i was mounting the bracket on . i had to tape one of the light adapter plugs as it was a loose fit in the bracket .
this product came with the wrong parts and it is unusable without the correct parts . the two plastic parts that make the cross which the cards hang from were incorrect . there are supposed to be two different parts and this one came with two of the same part .frame is cute . it has real weight to it so it doesn t feel or look cheap at all . note that it can only be used for verticle pictures because the images on the sides are set to be vericle .love these . . . . different colors the bottoms have a number on them and the holes match the number when possible is a triangle four is a square etc . . . also the number of holes matches the number on the cup . . . this toys will grow with my lo and has a small enough footprint that it can travel with us easily !
i use this with fairly light mics seenady dmk drum mic packagefor details .while i generally do not mic bass drums when i do this stand allows me to do it my way which may seem unconventional to some folks . i place the mic on the batter side of the drum about three feet back . since this can be problematic with the floor tom and throne and hi hat hindering access the boom and adjustability of this stand are a great help .where the stand shines if micing amps . some small amps such as thefender champion electric guitar amplifierare usually placed on a raised surface to keep them off the floor . this stand will reach any stand that is chair seat height . for larger amps that are on the floor or tiltback stands this mic stand will still allow you to position the mic where you need it .my use is relatively narrow kick drums and amps . but for each this stand is excellent in my opinion . with the mics i am using it is heavy enough to remain stable and for where i need to place those mics it allows me to do so with relative ease .i have mine attached to one of the support arms on myon stage ks xx pro double x keyboard stand . while this attachment is designed for both square and round tube supports i was unable to use it with anon stage tier folding z keyboard standeven with the top tier removed . the reasons for the problem with the latter stand is the friction fitting on the attachment bar was too small for the oblong support tube and had it mated the height of the attachment bar would not have cleared the top of the keyboard .when attached to theon stage ks xx pro double x keyboard standwith anon stage msa tb adjustable microphone boom blackattached to the top screw in post that perfectly mates with the boom this attachment bar boom combination easily clears the height of either keyboard i use aroland rd nx digital stage pianoor aroland v combo key stage keyboard .bottom line make sure your stand can accommodate this attachment bar according to the manufacturer it will work with most x style stands and carefully measure the height of the top of your keyboard from the center of the support arm to which this attachment bar will be inserted . the total height of the attachment bar after insertion is approximately . . if your keyboard is still too high for the attachment bar boom or other mic holder to clear you can gain an additional with ashure a x mic mount extension tube .i ordered two of these one to hold music and one to hold a netbook computer . i am very happy with how it performs in both situations . high quality solid support and good design decisions all around . the angle adjustment is very solid and it should be able to hold a very heavy book of music or a medium sized computer .the arm is just long enough that if turn the platform sideways you can lean the music stand back next to the mic stand that it is attached to . i will try to add pictures when i get a chance .this is really two products that work together a short boom arm with a mic attachment and a narrow music stand that mounts onto a standard microphone thread base . i am using one stand attached to a mic stand and a second with the arm removed mounted directly onto a gibraltar multi mount microphone clamp . major bonus points for making a solid piece of gear that is also modular and flexible .note the music stand easily detaches from the adjustable angle part for storage . this is great but be aware that the lock nut does not do a good job of locking so if you turn the stand upside down the it will fall off . this could be a problem if you experience frequent random gravity fluctuations .final verdict i own two and am considering buying one of the full width mus arm models also .
i originally purchased the deltran battery tender jr . to keep the battery on my vehicle charged as it s advertised of being capable of doing so on the packaging . this battery tender did not charge the battery on my car within the hour window and turned off has a built in timer . i called deltran and was told by customer service that the deltran battery tender jr . was too small to use on a car truck battery and that i should have purchased the deltran battery tender plus . i eventually purchased the deltran battery tender plus and the deltran . ft . extension lead dbt . the deltran battery tender jr . works fine on my walk behind lawn mower with electric start and should be fine for anything with a small battery . i would suggest that you purchase the deltran battery tender plus so you can have the option of using it on more equipment . deltran should change the label on the deltran battery tender jr . if it s not really intended for car truck batteries . check out batterytender .com for deltrans complete line .this is a very nice charger for many batteries but it states agm not good for many . an agm vdc vmax or optima type rv or marine battery requires a special charger that will deliver amps not . this is for a very small agm battery . this cost over and i will use it for regular flooded lead batteries but must buy another for agm or gel batteries for my rv . a specialty battery requires a specialty charger i found out . i do recommend this would buy again and i hope this helps .i bought this to charge my rv batteries and my riding mower batteries over the winter . the items works great no issues with overheating or overcharging would recommend to others with rv batteries and mowers .
this is simply a perfect stapler i cannot think of anything to improve . next time i need a stapler i will buy another of these .it sees heavy use and never jams . it can staple relatively thick documents although for really thick documents you need a special stapler with longer staples .it takes normal staples . it is easy to load . you can unlatch the bottom and use this stapler like a staple gun to staple directly into a cork board wall or telephone pole .just used this stapler to staple sets of page documents . jammed once . this is a solid stapler . heavy and metal .does not come with staples . uses standard size .if you are going to staple many papers and often i do recommend a stapler with a lever but they cost a great deal more .you can open this up to staple on bulletin boards push down on the lever on the back underside of the stapler .you can rotate the base plate push up from underneath so that it staples normally the two points bend in underneath or outward the two points bend out underneath . the outward one has less grip but is easier to remove .this all metal stapler is obviously meant for heavy duty office use . it s not big but it is extremely heavy . it requires more force to use than the easy touch stapler but can staple through a sheet of copier paper without any issues especially since you can easily pound on it and it won t even notice .in addition to stapling it can tack as well as pin . there s a catch at the base accessed from the bottom press to release the base for tacking . don t try to pull it apart like most staplers .what s pinning ? that s when you staple but instead of the legs of the staple bending inwards it bends outwards . it is useful for temporary binding . it s a lot easier to remove obviously since you can just slide the almost straight staple out . to pin you push up on the anvil from the base and rotate it . very effortless and the spring loaded anvil locks securely into position when released .if you want something that stays on a desk and can handle lots of abuse this one is a good choice . my favorite hand held stapler is a plier type the bostitch b hdp . it s not a desk stapler but it can punch through more sheets of paper or depending on the staple used without breaking a sweat .
this tascam us usb audio interface is exactly what i was looking for to record from our wireless mic with xlr outputs directly to my pc video editing software . we professionally produce instructional videos and needed this for voice over work on existing footage . before getting this convenient little unit we had to record into a camcorder and then import it into the pc so this saves us a step when we only need to record audio . here are my observations plug and play connected to my pc via usb and was instantly recognized usb powered no external power needed a big plus when using my laptop good sound clean and clear input multiple inputs xlr mic rca stereo line and hi z guitarmisc xlr input is not powered not a problem for us includes audacity software but we did not need to load ithighly recommended !cfhi do live shows online and my older behringer mixer does not have the built in usb port so these digitizers do a great job for me . i constantly get comments about how clean and clear my sound is and while i largely attribute that to the mixer this digitizer is just as important a link in the chain . very simple to use audio out of the mixer goes into this digitizer plug the usb cable into my computer my streaming software sees it and people hear me . i am definitely a behringer fan .i primarily use this as an usb adapter for my headphones so that i can connect convert the . mm headphone jack into my pc .the audio adapter is well built . it has a yellow led light that is solid when plugged into an usb port and blinks when there is a device that is connected to it through a . mm jack .installation was flawless . windows bit installed drivers immediately .no issues . no nonsense . simply works !

i have mine attached to one of the support arms on myon stage ks xx pro double x keyboard stand . while this attachment is designed for both square and round tube supports i was unable to use it with anon stage tier folding z keyboard standeven with the top tier removed . the reasons for the problem with the latter stand is the friction fitting on the attachment bar was too small for the oblong support tube and had it mated the height of the attachment bar would not have cleared the top of the keyboard .when attached to theon stage ks xx pro double x keyboard standwith anon stage msa tb adjustable microphone boom blackattached to the top screw in post that perfectly mates with the boom this attachment bar boom combination easily clears the height of either keyboard i use aroland rd nx digital stage pianoor aroland v combo key stage keyboard .bottom line make sure your stand can accommodate this attachment bar according to the manufacturer it will work with most x style stands and carefully measure the height of the top of your keyboard from the center of the support arm to which this attachment bar will be inserted . the total height of the attachment bar after insertion is approximately . . if your keyboard is still too high for the attachment bar boom or other mic holder to clear you can gain an additional with ashure a x mic mount extension tube .this cover does not fit a full size acoustic electric hohner guitar . i measured the whole at but this cover does not even come close to fitting ! it measures in diameter so check your guitar closely !i m using it for my alesis q midi keyboard . folds up easy so i can tuck it away . it may not work with a keyboard smaller than keys . as you lower it the support spreads out wide . good quality . adjustable height and for the dept of the keyboard .
very nice tone and effect for a one knob pedal . if all you need is a simple chorus effect this will satisfy .this jewel does give a vox ac tone depending how its used . for direct recording it does . if used with an amp maybe . but however you use it it is sweet .it does know when your guitar is in tune ! does it for you so you don t have to do it by ear .
if you are tired of carrying buckets back and forth the fish tank this one is for you . it attaches to your faucet and you can siphon and fill the tank . i use this on the laundry faucet which i needed to buy the additional brass adapter . it allows me to leave one piece connected to the faucet and the other to the plastic connector . then when i need to use it it snaps in place to the faucet and it is easy to remove .works well for my needs gal breeder aquarium . its a little hard to get adjusted perfect and to clean . advice is to keep away from air stone . mounts easy and securly . attached directly to my fluval intake hose .fit my gallon long wide high just right . the two glass pieces came already inserted into the plastic piece that allows the glass to be lifted for feeding . the other extra plastic piece goes onto the rear glass piece in case you have filters in the back and need to cut slots out for them . however i don t use that plastic piece and have a inch and a half space that fits well for my filter and heater . it also comes with an attachable handle that makes it easier to lift the glass .
i m using it for my alesis q midi keyboard . folds up easy so i can tuck it away . it may not work with a keyboard smaller than keys . as you lower it the support spreads out wide . good quality . adjustable height and for the dept of the keyboard .i have mine attached to one of the support arms on myon stage ks xx pro double x keyboard stand . while this attachment is designed for both square and round tube supports i was unable to use it with anon stage tier folding z keyboard standeven with the top tier removed . the reasons for the problem with the latter stand is the friction fitting on the attachment bar was too small for the oblong support tube and had it mated the height of the attachment bar would not have cleared the top of the keyboard .when attached to theon stage ks xx pro double x keyboard standwith anon stage msa tb adjustable microphone boom blackattached to the top screw in post that perfectly mates with the boom this attachment bar boom combination easily clears the height of either keyboard i use aroland rd nx digital stage pianoor aroland v combo key stage keyboard .bottom line make sure your stand can accommodate this attachment bar according to the manufacturer it will work with most x style stands and carefully measure the height of the top of your keyboard from the center of the support arm to which this attachment bar will be inserted . the total height of the attachment bar after insertion is approximately . . if your keyboard is still too high for the attachment bar boom or other mic holder to clear you can gain an additional with ashure a x mic mount extension tube .this is a great little keyboard for use with garageband on the ipad . garageband recognizes it as a controller for the keyboard smart keyboard sampler smart guitar smart bass and drums . you can even solo on the akai keyboard while the smart keyboard autoplays an accompaniment ! in addition to offering the superior feel of a real keyboard this akai keyboard has much more consistent touch sensitivity than what s built into garageband for ipad .unlike other keyboard controllers i ve tried this one plugs and plays with the ipad no powered usb hub required . you do need apple s camera connection kit of course to add a usb port to your ipad . it s not loaded with gimmicks just the essentials and the essentials work very well indeed . the keys are of standard width which is large enough for fumble free playing . it s lightweight compact and thus perfectly suited as an ipad accessory .
does what it does and has what it said .works good so far .buy it when you can have compatible staplersthis lead is good quality and predictable lead that does exactly what it s supposed to do . it s strong enough but also marks boldly .what more can i say . it s made out of cheap plastic but it does what it s supposed to do and it does it well .
these appear to be quality and perform as expected for leads . no issues and price is right . a lot cheaper than the leading brand s leads .while this fuel system cleaner is pricey compared with many others it has the highest amount of poly ethyl amine pea and as a result it has a very bad smell . however it is the best fuel cleaner on the market and i use it every oil change . this is cheaper and is at least equivalent to the other popular fuel system cleaner by amsoil . it is also about x stronger than regular techron and it s about the same price when on sale . excellent product stars .these filters are of a better quality than stock cost about the same or less than stock and are mudh easier to remove . even the feel between stock and these k n s is noticable . they use better quality cases filter media and gaskets . highly recommend .
first of all the handle is not installed you need to root around in the box for it . takes one second to put on .just got finished cutting out flashcards from cardstock of them so over cut and sheets of regular paper in half cuts . also tried it on photos .pros it easily cuts sheets of cardstock lb weight consistentlyraised edge makes it pretty easy to keep stacks of paper straight .it will cut slivers as small as mm wide off of sturdy paper photo paper or cardstock .easy to store it is pretty lightweight . with the green handle installed it is in including handle by in by . deep the handle part you can lock the arm in place .cons with regular paper it has a harder time with slivers it tends to smoosh the paper a bit .i wish it had labels across the top not just of inches and cm but where to align for cutting standard sheets in half for both long and short directions . i ended up marking these on it with a sharpie to speed up my project .this is not a product for use in a school or if you have to cut hundreds of sheets of paper every day . it is great for home use .i do a lot of scrapbooking and am always looking for good sheet protectors that are acid free and archival safe . these are the clear version . they are very thick i can hold one up in one hand and it almost stands straight up without flapping over . they have three reinforced holes on the side to put in a binder and a notch at both the top and bottom so the page turns easier . i use x paper or i cut down paper to insert in the sheet protector . the pre cut paper has approximately inch wiggling room . when i cut down a larger piece of paper like a x to fit into an x sheet protector sometimes ok lots of times it doesn t fit so i have to re cut it . with these sheet protectors even if i cut the piece a tad bigger it will still go into the sheet protector yay ! . the pages do not cling to the sheet protector when i m trying to put them in . i also use heavy weight paper back to back and it works great in these sheet protectors .i think these heavy weight sheet protectors are the best of the best . i have others that that light weight and a tad narrower so the page has to be squeezed in or re cut . i don t know what other good stuff to say about them i ll check back in years to let you know if they really are archival safe lol .i ordered these to have on hand to laminate paper documents and other items that are on card stock and bend shred etc . i am very happy with these they have the guides on them so that you can cut what you need from the sheet to fit the item you are laminating . they work very well and are easy to use but one note of caution be sure to slowly apply the sheet to your item so that the sheet doesn t wrinkle up because once it is on it will pull the writing off the item if you try to straighten the sheet to remove the wrinkles .
this stand works fine if you don t need a shock mount . the base is wide and heavy enough to secure the mic well and defeat most vibrations . i ran into trouble when trying to mount a r de nt a mic on a shock mount . the low height which would otherwise help stabilize the mic left too little clearance between the mic and desktop . if you think you might upgrade and someday use this stand with a shock mounted mic you re better off buying the slightly more expensiveon stage ds b adjustable desk microphone stand black .btw my copy of this stand also did not have the inch male thread .i mounted this on top of my on stage tripod mic stand to hold my small format mixer during gigs . works greatthis mic stand is solid and a good value but it s a one trick pony . the picture that is currently featured at the top of the listing here is incorrect the stand comes with threads and does not come with an adapter . not a huge deal if you re using a standard mic clip .the height is about . inches total and i m using mine to mic a kick drum right at the port . if you plan on using the stand for an amp or to mic something on a podium or desktop i d highly recommend you check out the adjustable desktop mic stand from on stage . i have one of those too but it was too tall even at it s shortest setting to mic my drum port but the adjustable height is very handy .
what can you say these are mailing labels for large envelopes or packages . they are plain white come in sheets of ten with the usual supporting formats in office suites and online at the avery website . the one key aspect of these labels that makes them different from the standard labels is the trueblock that masks any text that they are laid over no more seeing through the label to the prior addressee .as far as i am concerned these labels fulfill all of the claims made by avery and work splendidly . p first before you order these pay attention to the dimensions listed in the description . these are return address labels the small ones you stick in the corner of the envelope not the usually larger address labels that contain the address where you want your letter to go . they are therefore smaller than address labels . don t order these expecting to get larger labels . that said these are excellent quality print easily in my inkjet printer and as the package says are easy to peel off the backing sheet . i used one of the templates i got from the avery website i m on a mac using microsoft word for the mac and designed some nice looking labels . don t expect to fit more than lines of small print on each label . like i said these are small .this set of mailing labels from avery is a nice set where you get sheets with labels on each sheet . while they are good for envelopes they are the suggested size for current fulfillment by amazon fba sellers which is what i find value in . i dont send many letters or cards out so using it for fba .as said avery is the standard in the label making department . they are not the only ones but outside of amazon they are at target staples and office depot among others . but honestly the price that amazon is currently offering at off at the time of this writing you can get sheets for . . . bucks which is what you would pay for sheets at any other place . so its the best deal you are going to get ! !there are tons of different sizes for all different reasons . this set advertises that they are the send to address type label which is a perfect size . as usual you might meet up with the issue of only needing a few labels for addresses or whatever project you are doing and you have the rest of the sheet to deal with . its not always easy to feed printers and set it up to utilize the rest of the sheet .i like avery and tend to get their stuff as they print best on the sheet and they are most accessible in a pinch .
the diper depot works well with our prince lionheart whipe warmer . it s ridgid plastic construction makes it a stable platform as compaired to the soft vinyl organizers . my only whish is that the hinges on the lid of the diper dispenser could be made a little sturdier .we are very happy with the tub . it is light well made made in the usa ! thank you ! ! ! we buy a fair share of made in china stuff so it is nice to see a made in the usa product . the drain in the bottom is a great idea as well .i bought this item at a local specialty store and the clerk assured me the item was bpa free . when i got it home and opened it i saw the dreaded recycle code on the white part . i contacted baby bjorn to clarify . here is what they said babybj ouml rn and plastic safety when it comes to the material used in the production of our products we put significant effort into finding materials that meet our high standards of quality and safety . to guarantee the safety of our plastic products all babybj ouml rn kitchen and bathroom products are tested by specialized technology resources str an independent global provider of quality assurance testing . all plastics used in the production of our kitchen products fulfill the demands of the european eec and the american fda standard for plastics and are classified as food safe . through testing all of our kitchen products have been designated pvc free phthalates free and lead free . recent studies by health organizations such as the national institute of health have raised concerns about the safety ofbisphenol a bpa in plastic products . bpa is an industrial chemical that is used to manufacture polycarbonate plastic .polycarbonate plastic is the plastic that has caused considerable recent controversy because of its use in baby bottlemanufacturing and because it has been proven to leach bpa . polycarbonate plastic is not used in the production of any babybj ouml rn baby products and all babybj ouml rn products with a plastic component are bpa free . more specifically the babybj ouml rn plate is made of abs acrylonitrile butadiene styrene plastic which is certified bpafree . while both polycarbonate and abs along with other plastics have a recycling designation of there is no knownhealth risk associated with abs . i decided to keep it and see how it goes even though i prefer using glass or stainless steel items . i like that this one is not made in china like so many things tend to be .
i got this . inch organizer and the . inch model too . both fit perfectly into my file cabinet but i prefer the . organizer because the spacing between the wire spacers is smaller . i put just one folder in each space so that they stand up straight making the folder label very easy to see and identify . i ordered another . organizer to put in the same file cabinet drawer . i have the . incher down below in the lower drawer for bigger file folders like ones stuffed with old letters and product manuals as well as folders i don t access very often so i can bunch them together with other folders in the same space . it s not as easy to identify them that way because they tend to lean into each other but if they re folders you don t access very often it doesn t matter and the folders take up less space .i have used about a fourth of my box of smead folders and have found them to be quite good . the reinforced top keeps the tab from being easily bent over or distorted and makes it easy to find the folder when i need to in the cabinet . the surface allows for my folder labels to adhere well and i can write on them with both pen and pencil . some other folders are hard to write on due to their waxy surface finish . i like these because i can add notes to them easily .i would have given them five stars but the packaging is too fragile . i had to tape up the box to keep it from disintegrating at the corners .growing up i always remembered my dad s two multi drawer storage cabinets and how he had thousands of screws nuts bolts washers and odds and ends in them . whenever we were working on a project or fixing something he d be able to tell me i need a machine bolt and i just grabbed the appropriately labeled drawer out of the cabinet and bring it to him .now that i have a house of my own i need a couple of these . one of my drawers had been filling up in the past year with tons of extra fasteners washers and odds and ends and i found myself sometimes buying more of a fastener i already had simply because it was difficult to sift through all the little baggies to find the fastener i needed .so i bought two of these stack on cabinets knowing they don t have dividers or labels in the box and got out my trusty p touch label maker . i put all my bits and pieces in different drawers labeling each one as i went and i can now find exactly what i m looking for when i need it ! stability ease of use at first i feared the all plastic construction would make drawers hard to use and before i had anything in the drawers they would slide or shift way too easily even if i just bumped the table the cabinet was placed on . however once i loaded all the drawers they were much more stable and the entire cabinet didn t move when the table was bumped . durability the construction of this cabinet is the same as my dad s old cabinet but his had a metal frame meaning it ll probably last through another century or two . the plastic used here may warp over time or become brittle so i m not expecting a century of use but it seems to be holding up well to pretty heavy use so far . the drawer guides are simple and allow for easy drawer removal just pull out then pull up the front of the drawer . size of drawers as you can tell by the picture the drawers are either small good for maybe red wire nuts or a couple hundred small screws or medium size good for a few locks some extra hardware from cabinetry or some outlets and switches . since i m storing mostly little things bolts screws nuts washers wire nuts electrical connectors etc . the drawers are the perfect size for me and the clear face of the drawers lets me attach a small label and still see through to what s inside .overall a great organizer for the price there are better options on amazon and elsewhere but nowhere near this price .
i got this comb for my bichon it does not work at all . it works on my cats ok but it will not go through my bichons hair at all and he still has fluffy puppy furrwhat can i say . . . .he is an old cat and the cat will lick it with no problem thank goodness and it does workthis item will catch most of the cat litter from the cats paws as he she exits the cat box . helps to keep the floor or the carpeting cleaner and makes maintenance easier . i love it ! and the cats like it too .
the snugli is a great quality product . my friend gave me a baby bjorn carrier but i like this one much better . at first it seems like the straps are complicated but after a couple uses it is simple to use . my husband and i can both adjust the carrier to fit our different sizes . the hip strap is one of the main features that make this carrier so much better than bjorn . the hip strap like a backpack helps to distribute the weight and gets some of it off of your shoulders . i also like the fabric allot better than the bjorn which quickly gets worn looking . my baby a preemie now months likes to ride in the carrier facing in but loves riding in it facing out . this is a great buy .after hearing all the positive comments about the baby bjorn carrier i registered for it and got one as a shower gift . for the first few weeks we couldn t use it because my baby s head flopped around too much even when the carrier was tightened to its maximum head tightness and our son is a big baby . so we purchased the nojo sling which my husband found pretty comfortable but i never really liked because i felt the weight was not evenly distributed .i am in good shape work out and lift weights but on long walks the bjorn carrier really hurts my shoulders . the straps cut in when i wear it for power walks which was the purpose of my getting the carrier . i m fine for about minutes to a half hour but after that i m constantly tugging at the straps and trying to evenly distribute the weight .for this reason i m looking into getting the bjorn active which appears to have better padding . my suggestion would be that if you really want to be active with your carrier be careful to get something with good comfortable shoulder padding . your shoulders are carrying the weight of your child in this carrier .this pillow is cheaper and more functional than the boppy ! my son loved this pillow and the sling was really helpful
i was hoping to use the clay bar to remove water spots on a new truck but the one provided with this mequiar s kit was worthless for this purpose . the kit does include everything you need to apply the products in the kit which is a plus and probably the reason the kit is so popular .very quick and easy mounting and really adds to the look of the rear of the jeep . these are metal and not a cheap plastic and mount with included screws into the existing lens cover screw holes .installed on a acura mdx and it was painless . . . worst part of the install was getting out the interior panel holders as i did not have the proper tool .
whether you use plant substrate or not these root tabs are a must for root feeding plants ! you ll see noticeable response from the plants within hrs . assuming all other conditions like lighting are favorable . heavy root feeders which are vigorously growing should get a new tab at mos . don t add these right at the base of the plant . never vacuum the gravel when using root tabs there is no point in wasting your money if you re going to vacuum the gravel . . . if the tabs are released into the water column an algae storm will break loose . planted aquariums should never have the gravel vacuumed anyway as it disturbs the roots of plants and also removes all the good stuff plants feed on . just hover the vacuum about or inches above the gravel to remove detritus if you have to .pros high quality good value easy to usecons algae problems when used incorrectlyi actually buy these and put over the intake of my filter in a gallon shrimp tank . very easy just cut a plus sign in the middle and trim the outside and wala ! no more shrimp or baby creatures getting into your filter .i really wish people would really educate themselves about betta splendens and their housing requirements . these so called betta kits are not acceptable by any serious aquarist . this tank is clearly too small . a betta fish needs a larger tank that is big enough for a heater to fit inside it . bettas are tropical fish and they do need a heater to regulate their body temperature and keep them healthy room temperature water will not help keep a fish heal its fins if it has fin rot or shredded its fins for some other reason . secondly bettas are intelligent curious creatures who likes to swim around and through things . this tank does not provide the space for that kind of activiity . with this little prison er tank the fish is just going to sit there and eventually bite its tail due to boredom . if you want to get a betta fish at least get a medium kritter keeper a mini hyor heater and a few silk plants and nice bridge for the fish . i wouldn t even use this fish prison for water changes or as a hospital .
my tricky dogs can t get this open . they can however roll it around the kitchen . it also keeps the food fresh .it is a high quality item probably the highest of all that i have seen . however this will not work for smart dogs or cats !granted the dog probably wont be able to open the lid but they don t have to . the tray on the inside does not lock into position . it only takes a small amount of pressure to push on the side of the food compartment and make it rotate over to the next one ! my australian shepherd had this figured out in a matter of days and even my coating the open compartment in apple bitter spray did not stop him .this thing is useless if you have a smart animal .it is now completely useless to me . i m going to purchase one of the autofeeders with the reservoir bin that drops food into a bowl cut the bottom out of the bowl and mount the thing high on the wall where my dog cannot reach it . it ll drop the food onto the floor and he can have a blast cleaning it up . i think this is the only way i m going to be able to get any of these things to work with him .we have two of these to help with feeding a diabetic cat who needs a midday and overnight snack to avoid hypoglycemia .pros we opted for two meal units rather than one meal unit because it gives the cat a larger easier to reach food compartment there s no wheel mechanism to get out of synch and gives us more options for washing etc . we ve been pleased with this choice so far and would go the same route if we had it to do over again . the units are easy to operate and offer up to hours of timing options . the roomy food compartments can be taken out and run through the dishwasher . we use chilled canned food in ours along with a couple of ice cubes . the ice cubes help control the food temperature and add moisture to the food as they melt . each food container can easily hold a . oz can of food and ice cubes . our two cats took to the feeder right away . one sits staring at the closed containers for long periods of time apparently willing them to open for her . she has not made a serious attempt to open them yet but the feeder can withstand the occassional prying paw . as an added bonus using this unit for early morning feedings has quickly conditioned the cats to stop their annoying bedside wake up calls . they go pester the feeder instead of trying to wake us up . that alone is worth the price ! works fine with a rechargeable aa battery and one battery lasts a long time .cons for us precise timing is very important . the unit s timer seems to do very well if you are setting it for whole hour increments of four hours or more anything less is pretty iffy . when i thought i was setting two units to open at the same time test run they actually opened about minutes apart . not a big deal unless you have two hungry cats and one open food bowl . the units seem pretty flimsy especially the mechanisms that latch and lift the lids . i don t know that they will last very long . i really wish the unit would make some sort of noise to alert cats when it opens . as is it opens almost silently much quieter than the can opener that brings them running ! so food sits open until they wander in and notice it . this is especially a concern with a potentially hypoglycemic cat but i can t imagine that it is ever ideal . i wish the food trays weren t plastic as this is not the healthiest option for pets . among other things it can cause kitty acne that black crusty stuff on cat s chin . the unit is not made to work with an ac adaptor and there is no low battery warning light or signal . thus it is a worry that the battery will run down and the feeder won t open while we are away .all in all it is a good very basic unit to help manage feeding cats and small dogs for short trips between catsitter visits on longer trips and for daytime or nightime snacks for cats with special dietary needs .i just wonder why there does not seem to be a top of the line timed pet feeder out there . a sturdy model with stainless steel food cups a digital timer built in storage for cold packs and an optional feeding chime would be worth spending money on ! until the day it is invented this one seems to be the next best bet .
if the thought crosses your mind that you need a foot rest then i would certainly recommend this model . its a pretty wide inches base that gives your feet plenty of room to rest and move around or have your feet apart comfortably . its fairly heavy so you know the steel can handle some weight . there is no assembly you just pull it out of the box and place it on the floor . if you have sleek floors it has rubber feet in the corners to prevent it from sliding around . the top area is covered with a comfortable yet slightly gritty pattern that is good for shoes or bare feet .once on the floor it is easily adjustable with your feet just by pushing up or down . once there it stays snug without feeling loose . you can adjust the tightness of the foot rest with the two nuts on the inside .while simple in design its perfectly functional and a solid piece of furniture that will outlast most furniture .like many other people sitting at a desk is awkward for me it seems as if the chair has to be high up to reach the desk resulting in the floor seeming to be too low . i usually end up sitting cross legged or with my feet resting on the chair legs . this foot rest allows foot angles that feel natural and it virtually lifts up the floor ! it has four rubber like pads on the base to help keep it from shifting around and a rubber like top to keep your feet in place . the width is wide enough that many foot positions can be used . right out of the box the one i received was set at the perfect tension so that i can adjust the angle using only my feet resulting in being able to adjust foot rest positions as needed .while it s more functional than decorative in style it looks better in person than in photos and virtually disappears when underneath a desk . the metal is gray and the rubber like sections are black . there s a little m brand sticker on the front left corner but it s easily removed if unwanted .because my current desk has a pull out keyboard tray which extends the depth of the desk space when it s in use it s a bit awkward to move the foot stool back and forth by getting beneath the desk . i need to move it forward when using the desk and back when not using it . without doing this i am unable to push the desk chair underneath the desk . this maybe wouldn t be an issue however with a desk where the keyboard rests atop the main surface .this foot rest is easy to set up and is very sturdy . the top has a nice grippy surface that really holds my feet .the only gripe is that it is a bit easy to tip if you put one foot on it close to either edge .
i use stoner s invisible glass strictly when detailing cars others or my own . it doesn t streak and applies well . it s alcohol based so its safe for window tint unlike ammonia based products such as windex . unlike other stoner s products it can be purchased in a traditional spray bottle rather than a pressurized can . great product !this stuff is good for cleaning and leaving a nice long lasting shine especially on dark vehicles ex black dark grey red etc . some reviews are correct is saying it doesn t hold suds but you must understand that this product contains conditioners which will do that . its best to use a bottle attached sprayer on hose with solution in it . this will make suds suds but want last as again it has conditioners in it . product smells like hair shampoo gold color doesn t make paint change in appearance either some products after long use stays attached because of wax buildup can make your vehicle appear to look the color of stuff you are using . good stuff way better than mothers . if it doesn t clean like you need then go get a bottle of blue dawn detergent .works great and has a pleasant citrus smell . but man does the mist burn your eyes . made my interior look new and dried to a natural low shine . did not attract dust or stay wet like other products . i will be buying more of this .
behringer doesn t have the best of reputations but some of their gear does a great job at the price . this is one of them . this gives me plenty of clean volume to run my headphones . i run a project studio with an apogee duet as my interface . i needed this because sometimes i need to monitor something while another person in the room is recording monitoring a track .my main headphones are beyerdynamic dt pro sennheiser hd sony mdr v and then i have some others . all of my headphones are comfortably driven by this headphone amp with plenty of gain on tap and i get very good volume and even at the exact same volume as the input i find that the sound is improved by using this headphone amp . it s hard to describe but it just feels a bit fortified and a little bit stronger . i ve had a presonus headphone amp before that cost many times as much as this little behringer headphone amp and the sound was no better .the volume pots are very smooth and there is no noise that i can hear that is introduced by this amp . make sure you use a quality sound source because this will faithfully amplify anything that goes in . for instance if i run a cable from my imac s built in headphone output to this amp and turn up the volume i can hear a little buzz and random digital sounds but that s not the amp it s the source . running the output from my apogee duet the sound is very clean and strong .there are some annoying things about this amp . obviously the external power supply is annoying there s no on off switch and it s light enough that when everything is plugged in it doesn t want to stay in place . however that s nothing that velcro tape on the desk can t fix and the rest of the problems are stuff you have to live with when you get something that does so much for less than the price of a decent pair of headphones .i ll start off by saying that i m a proud owner of gibson es acoustic electric pono msd e blackheart bh h blackheart bh a weber vintage series a inch ohm watts in an open back solid pine cabinet a jensen mod inch ohm watts all tube fender tweed champnow that you know the gear i have what i can play through an amp and what i can plug an amp head into i ll sum up my review with this what you get out of this amp is completely dependent on your speaker cab the cables you use and how clean your power is . got good gear ? this little amp will sound great .the detailsthe amp itself is tiny . i have an electro harmonix pedal that s bigger than this amp ! still it packs a punch . with the gain at about up and the volume at half i get great clean tone and enough volume for a small venue . crank the gain up more and it gets louder and more distorted as you go . yes this little amp will go from jazz country to rock metal with a twist of a dial .the line in and headphones jacks are a nice touch that none of my other amps have . if you want to quietly play along with some tunes you can . practice time just got better for your neighbors .the one lone tube in the micro terror is the pre amp tube . mine came stock with a jj tubes ax . i understand that s standard . a jj is nice but it will not warm up this little hybrid enough for you to get even a whiff of tube tone . dig out an old phillips rca sylvania or ge to get this guy to sound a bit like its big brother . i had an old ge made in great britain lying around and popped it in my micro terror warmed it right up cleaned up a bunch of high end tinniness .still compared to my two tube bh h or my all tube champ this guy does sound more solid state than anything . but compared to a buddy s roland and solid state ampeg it s downright mellow .no effects loop means that your time based effects reverb echo chorus can get noisy . so if you like pedals stock up on volt batteries to avoid power adapter noise add in .speaking of power adapters a previous reviewer is right . the external power brick for this guy seems fragile . i m not a fan of the thin line from the brick to the amp . it s holding up but one round with my cat and i ll be looking for a new power supply .the rubannoyance one cheap cable anywhere in the mix will result in annoying hiss even at low volumes . i found that out quickly . so get a proper speaker cable and a high end instrument cable or you will hate this amp . i m running it with a gls gauge speaker cable and a planet waves american stage instrument cable both available here at amazon or any good guitar shop .annoyance this is a watt amp right ? well . . . if you don t run a ohm speaker you won t get all watts . the micro terror self adjusts to the power needed to drive your speaker by stepping down output . yes yes . . . don t quote physics to me . at ohms i still get good volume . but at ohms like my bh it sounds like a or watt amp . that said i m actually a fan of the tone i get with my ohm weber in its pine cab . the inch jensen speaker in my champ while nice can t put out the low notes like i d prefer and the jensen mod is too clean . but the weber a sounds fantastic to my ears even with the loss in volume .annoyance the micro terror is so small and so light it ll tumble right to the floor if anyone kicks your chord . unlike a nice pound amp the chord won t pull out . so be careful .mitigation for annoyance the all steel chassis can handle a tumble from three feet up onto hardwood floors . . . though it will gouge your floor .and then there s the standard annoyance that comes with owning any guitar amplifier if the power is noisy or ungrounded you will wind up with hiss no matter what . i always carry a monster hts and run my amp through it that really helps in cleaning up signal noise . if you don t have one get one . the are cheap and they work . the summaryafter all that i can still say i love this little amp ! i ve gigged with it and it sings well . plus the added gag of tiny ukulele tiny amp always draws a laugh . . . until i crank the dial over and shred some faces .for the price you can likely afford to pick up worth of guitar speaker chords and wind up with a healthy rig . and for the price this is a solid star amp . i know i m happy .what you need to know about this mic this mic is very directional . you must keep your mouth in the sweet spot at all times for best results . pulling back an inch gets into tinny muddy territory and an inch too close makes for a strong proximity effect . i found that a palm s width from the tip of the mic works best . as long as i keep my mouth there the results are predictable and good regardless of the room i m in . also if the mic is aimed too low on your face like at the lower lip or chin you ll sound like you have a stuffy nose . aimed too high like at the bridge of the nose sounds sneering and nasal . right at the upper lip works well for me . the bass cut and presence boost are convenient . use a plastic thing like a guitar pick to switch them as metal will scratch it . i ve played around with the switches and in the end both set to flat was best . initially i thought the presence boost was a good idea but in a mix it made my vocals too honky in the upper mids . flat s where it s at . flat sounds most natural . being a dynamic it won t sound as open and airy as a condenser might . though it takes eq well and you can eq that in . if you remove the foam and use a pop filter you do get more highs but after working with that for a while i realized it doesn t always sound right seems to unbalance the highs above k toward sibilance a little too much but it might work for you . after using it for a few years i learned that starting with a bad mix that is too bright or blaring and then adding in the sm b on vocals causes the mic to appear dull and muffled but really it s the mix that s the problem . whereas if i start with the vocal sound and make it clear and natural and build the mix around it the mix turns out to have a natural sound that s not too bright or dull either . yes it rejects room sounds more than a condenser but not gobsmacked amazingly so . it rejects what s behind and to the side but in front it s pretty sensitive . so if you re singing with an echoey room behind you it will pick that up . so don t think this will make you sound like you re in a dead control room unless you actually are in one . hang some blankets or acoustic foam behind you and you re set . being that it records about twice as dry as a condenser it takes reverb pretty well in a mix meaning you can add reverb and delay without having your vocals drop too far away and undefined in the mix . so what does it sound like ? the sound is very natural and true to my voice . it truly is a vocal mic first and foremost . that plus the dry up close characteristic are this mic s top selling points . it works fantastically on death metal growls and clean singing atop sparse acoustic clean backgrounds . it does have slight color in the mids i agree with the frequency response chart indicating it has a slight scoop hz slight boost hz but it s still natural sounding despite that . the color is tailored to the voice reduce the honky boxy mids accentuate the main vocal intelligibility range . that s one reason why this mic is considered flattering on vocals . it still has body though definitely not a thin sounding mic . this thing is heavy and rugged . the capsule is surrounded by this truncated cone like metal screen enclosed on all sides . the screen is like the kind you see behind microwave oven doors . what i like about this mic is that i can throw it inside a bubble mailer or wrap it in a scarf for storage and not have to worry about crushing or damaging it and it doesn t need a big case like some condensers and especially tube mics do . so it s actually compact in practice and quick to set up with one of those detachable mic adapter mounts . even without the adapter it has a convenient free rotating collar to screw it onto a mount stand so that you can hold the mic in place while screwing it down . this mic needs db gain for loud singing db for quiet singing db for whispering . make sure your preamp is designed for at least db of clean gain . some cheaper usb interfaces only go up to db . if your interface lacks the juice no worries get yourself a cloudlifter and it ll add db of nice clean gain and it s phantom powered too .overall i would prefer a condenser in a good room since it allows me to move a little more without coloring the sound and because it has a more openness and air compared to this one . but since my room isn t perfect this will do . the biggest pros are that it s natural sounding and that even with reverb and delay it stands out in a mix . it s especially good on spoken voice as it was designed for since unlike a condenser the sm b does a very good job of not picking up as many mouth clicks mouth noises and background hissing .in the end if i had to get rid of all my mics and keep only one for vocals for the rest of my life it would be the sm b . mainly because i know i can conveniently use it anywhere anytime and get reliable good results .edit forgot to say when you listen to mic shoot outs on the net often times the tip of the sm b will be positioned the same distance as the condenser . this is a problem because the sm b s diaphragm is actually back a few inches . so the condensers will be closer to the talent or lack of talent than the sm b in such cases causing the latter to sound more duck ish honky un detailed or thin due solely to distance factors and is thus not characteristic of the intrinsic mic color . in shoot outs where the proper distance was used you d be surprised how much the sm b sounds like a good condenser . it really does . of course it may be missing air or conversely be less prone to sibilance but as i said below you can easily eq that in since this mic takes eq very well . seriously a db shelf in the highs . another thing i wanted to add is that the gentle bump in the k to k region for vocal definition that his mic has can sound slightly honky or strident or blaring depending on some sources but again you can eq that down a bit . and finally when shure says this mic has a flat response that s not true it has color and the frequency response charts show it . yet the color gives it a larger than life natural sound on voice so it sounds natural even though it s not completely transparent and honest .
this tascam us usb audio interface is exactly what i was looking for to record from our wireless mic with xlr outputs directly to my pc video editing software . we professionally produce instructional videos and needed this for voice over work on existing footage . before getting this convenient little unit we had to record into a camcorder and then import it into the pc so this saves us a step when we only need to record audio . here are my observations plug and play connected to my pc via usb and was instantly recognized usb powered no external power needed a big plus when using my laptop good sound clean and clear input multiple inputs xlr mic rca stereo line and hi z guitarmisc xlr input is not powered not a problem for us includes audacity software but we did not need to load ithighly recommended !cfhi primarily use this as an usb adapter for my headphones so that i can connect convert the . mm headphone jack into my pc .the audio adapter is well built . it has a yellow led light that is solid when plugged into an usb port and blinks when there is a device that is connected to it through a . mm jack .installation was flawless . windows bit installed drivers immediately .no issues . no nonsense . simply works !very simple device to connect a quality dynamic microphone or instrument using a direct box to the usb input of a computer . i plugged in my mic and plugged the cable into my pc . win automatically searched for and found the drivers in about three minutes . i then recorded some vocals using audacity a free open source download . recording was whisper quiet with no background hiss or noise at all . recording level was great not sure why some reviewers said it was too low . note that this will not provide phantom power nor does the item description imply that it will . usb only provides vdc and phantom power usually requires vdc . unless there is some kind of power converter which would be much too large to fit in this compact package it is impossible for this or any similar sized cable to provide the higher voltage that phantom power requires . use this with a dynamic mic or direct box and if you use it correctly you will be very happy !
this is an excellent final coat wax for your car . in my case i use the meguiar s nxt polish wait several hours to let it cure then apply this wax . i use it on my car that has color my other car is white . be aware it is harder to buff this . i maintain my cars by hand and became tired thei first time i used it . i washed clayed hand compounded then did coats of wax . the next car i did i paced myself and washed compounded one day . then the next day i polished and waxed the car .this product still amazes me how it works i found out about it on a chat forum and thought i d give it a go .small cal full of the solution in a bucket full of water wipe on your car one section at a time then dry it straight away and i swear to god it looks like you have waxed your car my wife was amazed at how good it looked . i don t know how it works but a few days after washing my vehicle it rained like it always does and the rain beaded on my hood and just ran off . excellent product .was my first time cleaning an maf sensor on a car . i used this product on two vehicles . works great and evaporates very quickly so as not to leave residue . if you ve never done this before just note you have to wait a little to let the thing dry before trying to start your car once it s back in .
the xp is a very good canister filter .the good ? decent sized trays priming intake tube configurable outflow tubes all you need in a box package with exception of biomedia .the bad ? the quick disconnect is not heavy duty and can be distorted by any tension on one of the tubes especially the output resulting in a leak because the o rings do not seat . also the o ring are not a tight fit and cannot handle much pressure . if you have any inline accessories that constitute a significant load ie . uv sterilizers co reactors etc water will leak past the disconnect o rings and onto your floor after flooding the top unit on the inside ! worst of all this happens after about an hour or so and is not readily apparent !bottom line i would much rather not have the convenience of the quick disconnect and instead have some external ball valves . my xp leaked on my the first time i used it . i searched online and this is a common problem .this was purchased to replace the one that was missing on a filter . it allows proper angle adjustment on the aquaclear filter and works as intended .container is made in a pretty heavy duty plastic the hinge where the lid connects to the container is pretty weak but aside from that the rest is pretty well made . the lid has a strip of rubber foam along the outside edge where it comes into contact with the lid of the container which provides an airtight seal .generally speaking pretty easy to use and is as described .
i think the chair would serve it s purpose for a little while but the way the arms go together and fold for storage travel seemed way too cheap for me . the paint on the metal was scratching off when i twisted the arms to fold it . i only tried it on a counter so i can t say how it works on a table with a skirt but i returned it and spent more money for a better made chair by phil ted called metoo . the phil ted chair folds flatter than this one and is lighter but doesn t come with a travel bag where this one does . i can live without the bag for a chair that seems safer to me . and the metoo chair does go on my table with a skirt .great product does what it needs to do if only the product works better for small baseboards under in . the template does not do well on baseboards since it will be short a few cm depend on how thick the baseboard is in depth .overall pretty sturdywhy i love this toilet . . . .it does not have all the bells and whistles of some of the toilets out there . . .but really why do you need them ? this one is easy to clean . . .must be pretty comfortable because my kid will sit on it and read in the bathroom . . .it is the perfect height . . .and has a nice seat back . . . .best part it doesn t tip over yet at least . not sure how it works for boys . . .but for a girl it worked well .
these locks just cannot be beat . they were featured on hgtv to baby proof your house which is how i found out about them in the first place . they cannot be opened at all by the child unlike many of the other items out there . you have to not only have the key to open the door you have to know how to manipulate it to open . if you have chemicals that you have store within a child s reach there is no other better way than this lock to make sure that child is safe . i feel very blessed that i found out these locks exist because my little one is extremely curious and figures out everything ! trust me you won t be disappointed . regarding the installation my husband is not a handyman he s a musician and if he can figure it out so can just about anyone else . buy them !my only complain is that it is supposed to swing closed by itself and it doesn t exactly do that it will shut some but not all the way so you have to keep an eye on it . on the plus side once you get the hang of it it is very easy to open with one hand ! a very necessary feature !i wanted this product because i didn t have to buy special bags for it and it also came highly recommended . the only problem i have is with the handle you use to open the top compartment . the way you have to shove your fingers under it and pull is just too tight . i can t tell you how many times i ve chipped a nail or hurt my fingertips because of the force needed to open it . that would be my only complaint .
very nice inch notebook and a slant ring which actually holds more than the circular ring . very sturdy and well made ! ! ! !this is a . mm lead pencil . it is machined metal in construction and has a drafting instrument feel . the point indeed has a very long non retracting sleeve to stabilize the lead so that you can use templates rules french curves and other drafting tools with this pencil . the grip section has both cross hatched machining and rubberized interior providing both a strong hold and yet a softer grip . the grip section rotates with a small window to allow you to indicate which hardness of lead you have loaded . it comes with hb leads . the point section retracts fully by activating the pocket clip so it is truly pocket friendly . the first button press long push extends the point section and subsequent shallower pushes extend the lead . pulling out the button reveals a small fixed length eraser of small diameter this short length is somewhat limiting for erasing on the road but your dedicated desk eraser will probably be used in a workspace . the pocket clip is excellent it is spring hinged so that it works like an alligator clip and has two somewhat pointed tips that securely grip the fabric of a shirt pocket . but the long travel of the clip allows you to attach the pencil to a pile of papers a notebook a cable or whatnot . with a better eraser especially a twist up type it would easily be a five star pencil .it fits in my file cabinet correctly and dimensions were perfect . spacing is nice for binders and books . it does take a bit of elbow grease to get the little feet on the ends . they are rubbery plastic and its a super tight fit . great product though !
i installed two of these in about an hour . it would have been easier with two people the hole punchers included aren t great but the get the job done . the guard covered most of my railing from the base up to about an inch from the top rail . if you are going to cover a long section ft it can be difficult to get the full length to stay flat . what i did was punch a hole along the top every feet and used a zip tie pulled through the hole over the top rail to hang the sheet of plastic making sure the sheet was level and pulled tight horizontally . then i went to the bottom and every third vertical pole i punched a hole on either side of the pole as far in as the hole punch would reach and zip tied the sheet to the pole . then i cut the top zip ties and slid the plastic sheet down so that it rested level on the bottom and punched holes along the top a the same intervals at the bottom . two holes every third pole and zip tied around the pole . they supply plenty of zip ties so you can afford to make a few mistakes . the plastic is stiff but not so stiff that it breaks . the babies haven t defeated it yet .i absolutely love the handy s plus pad . i purchased of the full size pads for my son over a year and a half ago and i think they are great . my year old has slept in a full size bed since he turned . these pads really work no leaks ! are comfortable and wash up well . i only have complaints . . . . the side flaps aren t quite long enough to fully tuck under if you have a pillow top mattress although you can make it work if one side of the bed is against the wall and you pull the opposite side really tight and . the top and bottom of the pad tend to curl up after several washings . despite these complaints i have not been able to find a pad that is even near the quality and comfort of this one . the reason that i own of these is that if you truly want full coverage on the bed for a child that rolls all over while sleeping you need to use with some slight overlap so to use and for back up . i also use one full size on the spinmaster flip open sofa to keep spills and accidents from staining the sofa . the full size fully covers the full length of the sofa . i think this is a must have product for parents of toddlers that don t want to be constantly changing bed sheets or trying to wash a children s sofa that really isn t meant to be washed . fyi . . . if you like basic comfort s ultimate crib sheet then you ll also like their handy s plus pad . the handy s plus pad is basically the ultimate crib sheet with side flaps and without the snaps . in fact the pad portion of the handy s plus pad full size is almost the same size as the ultimate crib sheet . fantastic product . our child loves playing in this pack n play . even if we don t put toys inside the walls are moderately entertaining for our child . the sun has a mirror plastic kind that sort of warps images the butterfly has crinkly wings fabric with plastic inside for noise another side has a bug with wings inside and the final side has a squeaker which is really hard to use .it s all one piece so no assembly ever required . the sides are collapsible with the push of a button on each side . the ground mat that the child sits on servers as the exterior of the case that holds the pole assembly together when folded up . and there s a light plastic zipper bag with handle that serves as a carrying case . it packs up into a long rectangle probably x x feet .pros pack up or unpack in under a minute no assembly required just set it and lock it into place like a collapsible baby stroller . sturdy build child won t be able to tip it over and it would never fold on itself . soft but strong mesh walls that child can see through but can t stick fingers or small objects through mesh .cons this is a minor complaint the squeaker on one of the walls is impossible for a child to squeak you have to press it from both sides of the wall because it s sewn so tightly as a side effect of the sturdiness it s very heavy . on the plus side of that it is made of sturdy materials .
this one is a total waste of plastic . i used it once a day and it lasted . i hate evenflo products but went against my better judgement anyway . the motor weakened by the day . it is loud ! ! ! all noise no work ! i had to squeeze with the motor at the highest setting to get just a little .i would get about a total of oz after min . when i called the company which has the worst hours they just sent me a bag of parts and said you figure it out . it took wks for them to arrive . parts made no difference . first they said no return . i said like hell you wont . then they said only half the msrp with me paying shipping . i still have the damn thing . not even worth going to the po for half the price minus shipping . i ended up with a free brand new medela hand pump from wic if i had only asked from the get go . with that one i got a total of oz in min . next time around i will fork out the money for the electric medelas . cost more but they know what they are making .i had noooooooooooooooooo idea . . ! ! ! i only recieved this pump no electrical one and i wanted diiiiie ! i was in pain for days after i gave birth irritable because of the lost of sleep and trying to conform to the babies temporary sleeping pattern . i had a low milk supply and breastpumping for hour for only ounces this was not a joke ! i wanted diiiie i tell you . . i would finish pumping and da baby would be getting up for a feeding . . . noooooo ! already i would think . . . yes and with only oz to show . here i go with the stupid manuel pump . . . no . . i now know better . . . . electronic and a good brand so what you pay . and change its worth your sanity sleep time energy and appreciation for the bond with the baby . my milk supply in time grew not soon enough i am still nursing and again the manuel pump and i did not have a good relationship . we started off badlyi was very unhappy with this pump . i m a first time mom and didn t realize that in some cases spending the extra money is sometimes necessary with baby supplies . in the hospital i was supplied with a medela harmony pump to use and was very happy with it i thought this would work the same at home . i was very wrong ! ! ! i live in a small town and we had a hour ride home from the hospital . by the time we arrived home i was very engorged and desperate . my newborn had latching on problems at first so as soon as we got home i assembled the pump and sat down to use it . nothing happened . i thought i was having letdown problems so i tried hand expressing and was suprised to find that i was spraying milk everywhere ! there was just not enough power to pull out the milk . i was very upset about wasting my money . it s not like this is a returnable item . luckily the hospital had sent me home with a medela manual pump and that worked great until i could find a decent rental . please listen to the low ratings on this pump . i didn t and i regret it . i could ve spent the additional money and purchased a good recommended pump . i ended up throwing this pump away and i cringed when i did it it felt so wasteful !
you would figure that using this kit is a no brainer screw it in and pump right ? there are no instructions that come with the set . although i guess common sense should have told me to use the ring with the system i didn t . the first time i pumped the bottle leaked on me . so i learned . . . use the ring ! i am not lowering my rating based on this since it is my error for not using the ring .i also have found that i can pump directly into different brands of storage bags using this connector when i used my medela pump with the very old avent naturally drop in liner bottles no longer sold but i occasionally see it on ebay . the drop in liner bottles i have were given to me by someone who bought them ten years ago . these are the drop in bottles that came before the avent tempo drop in bottles . i do not know if you could pump directly into the avent tempo with any type bags as i have not tried it . but with the original avent naturally drop in bottles i can insert any brand storage bag with the zipper below the screw in part attach the pump connector to secure the bag and pump directly into a storage bag . this way i don t have to transfer from bottle to bag .based on the product pictures and product description i could not figure out a couple things . how many conversion connectors came with this set ?this package comes with four connectors for the regular avent bottles and to fit the via storage system . . which pumps does the conversion kit work with ? these are the pumps as listed on the box medela pumpsevenflo comfort selectameda purely yourslansinoh double electricplaytex embracedr . brown s natural flow electric manualupdate april i have been using the adapters for a couple weeks now and have had no leaks when using the ring . in the mornings i will pump directly into the avent bottles withphilips avent bpa free classic bottle sealing discsin place to store in the fridge . that way my mom can just attach the nipple to the bottles . no more transferring from the medela bottles with the awful nipples that collapse due to the vacuum created when the baby drinks .as for pumping directly into storage bags i have used the nuk medela and lansinoh bags with the avent drop in bottles and find that the lasinoh bags work the best with this system . i am ordering other types of bags to try . . . but so far lasinoh bags work the best . if anyone is interested i can post a picture of the adapters connected to the drop in bottles with the storage bags .the kit came with two sets of adapters to connect directly from the medela pump to most bottles the one pair fits avent old new style natural bottles perfectly . so much more convenient to pump directly into normal oz bottles !when i bought this system i was concerned if it would be compatible with the pump i chose ameda purely yours ultra . the answer is only if you also buy the playtex breast milk storage kit . the kit comes with the adapters that you need .with respect to the nipples that come with this set our baby eventually got used to them but it took a few days .
it fit my american vintage s strat . my guitar had an hole pickguard . i ordered an hole pickguard and it fit like a glove .the guitar is ply plastic black white black . this is what most black fender genuine replacement pickguards will look like .i am happy with the purchase .looks better than the expansive one my grandson has . he keeps using mine ! ! ! arrived early and is of great quality . fits my very old acoustic just right !i bought this after mistakenly getting the same model in a size . this one actually fits and works great one both my acoustic and electric .
my baby had latch problems which caused me tons of nipple pain . this helped us both to make it through breastfeeding . although it definitely helps reduce the pain it tends to move around which can be annoying . recommendation lubricate it with lanolin first to help it stick to your breast .so i just noticed this pillow looks like a piece of poo . however it is very comfortable and perfect for pregnancy . i have the worst hip pain and this pillow helps alleviate that pain .this pillow has been a life saver throughout my pregnancy . it helps to keep you sleeping on your side and supports your hips belly and head . i sometimes even catch my husband using it !
i bought these mics to fit a shure mic and a gls mic and it doesn t fit either . a little too small .one thing i love about this extension bar is it will fit over the relatively large diameter down tubes on my hi hat stands . i use anon stage microphone inch gooseneckto connect to the bar then i attach either anady dm drum and instrument microphoneor dm microphone . the bar gooseneck arrangement is sturdy enough for that mic model .this also works well for mounting on microphone stands . i use it and a shorter gooseneck to mount the dm for tenor and alto saxophones or a dm for baritones . again it works perfectly for my situations .i always keep a few of these plus various size goosenecks just in case i need to mount an additional microphone and i am short on stands . it s one more tool to make set up less stressful .trust me when you need one and chances are you will if you re a drummer or a sound tech you will thank yourself for having the foresight to purchase it for situations i cited above and those that i have not foreseen .this didn t exactly fit my mxl v g condenser mic so i took out the bottom piece which took a little work then i was able to get the bottom screw plug of my mic to fit . it s solid and works well .

the user guide for this calculator is obviously either written for another model or by a tech writer who has serious problems . in many instances when keystroke examples are provided if you key in the information as indicated the calculator will simply give up and provide an error message .the machine works fine if you just address it intuitively after you have trashed the guide book .many cute features on this phone include being able to program a name with a specific ringer verbal caller id just says the number or unknown caller different screensavers etc . the range on this phone is excellent and i can hear quite clearly from a distance . also being . ghz it won t interfere with wireless routers and wireless cameras . excellent buy !bottom line the texas instruments ti plus graphing calculator is probably the last calculator you will purchase in your academic career it is just that powerful .it s time for me to head back to school devry university s keller graduate school of management that is . this time i am in pursuit of my mba with a concentration in networking and telecommunications . why pursue a boring ole traditional mba when new technology is to be learned ? so that means math lots of math loads of math in the form of algebra calculus and the ever dread statistics .did i mention that i hate math ! ? what does one do when one hates math but still needs to do it in spades ? buy a calculator of course but not just any calculator i needed a calculator cable of doing complex mathematics including graphing equations . my very first course called for a texas instruments ti plus graphing calculator . powered by aaa sized batteries plus cr or cr lithium battery for backup the ti plus graphing calculator is large unit ideal for advanced mathematics students high school algebra to college level calculus and statistics . the ti plus packs a lot of mathematical punch and the price of . office depot .com certainly confirms it .the ti plus calculator combines features for statistical analysis engineering trigonometric and financial functions making it ideal for a student seeking an mba . financial functions include tvm cash flows and amortization though surprisingly a percentage key is missing from the calculator .the two pound yes it is heavy kind of ti plus features a non backlit x pixel grey scale lcd screen that is frankly hard to read unless the lighting is exactly right . but the lcd display can display graphs and tables on a full as well as split screen . and the display exhibits up to characters and eight lines . the calculator can graph trace equations while scrolling through table values . and the ti plus can store and analyze up to equations .i also purchased the optional ti graph link software and usb cable . the software and cable allows one to connect the ti plus to a computer via a usb port permitting the transfer of files and data between the two devices .my thoughtsample time should be given to learning what the ti plus can bring to the table . all of the nine digits are there of course but the face of the calculator contains a whole lot more in the form of multi colored special function buttons and there are a lot of them ! however the ti plus ships with very detailed instruction manual so i plan to carry it with me at all times .as i stated above and it is worth restating the ti plus s non backlit lcd is a little difficult to read when the unit is lying flat on a desk and a lot will depend on the lighting conditions . even with the right lighting the top line of the display is hard to read .though i was stunned by the high price of the unit the texas instruments ti plus graphing calculator is probably the last calculator you will purchase in your academic career it is just that powerful . you can buy it for a high school student and s he can use it through graduate school .
i read some mixed reviews about the unit but i ve not noticed anything abnormal with mine . seems to do an accurate job and really cheap price .i read many negative reviews on several sites . i can understand how the quality may not be consistent but as a seasoned folk and ethnic musician i must say that the set i just purchased is quite good especially the lower pitched harps in g a and bb . there are minor tuning issues with all instruments especially folk instruments . this is what gives them their charm and voice . i find my whole set to be of very adequate quality and i will not need replacement harps right away as many have stated they had to do . the set is quite nice for the price !i was a little concerned after reader some of the reviews here but the warranty blue s reputation and amazon customer service convinced me to give it a try . and in general i m pretty satisfied with it . using it with one of my oktava mk microphones i get excellent sound no hum and so far excellent reliability . i m using it with audacity and a few other programs none of which have any difficulty recognizing it . there were some issues setting it up initially and i m a bit leery about the plastic construction but for what i paid i think it s a good value . for those thinking of using it in field recording stick it inside a carrying bag and tape the cable to it to prevent stressing the usb connector . you shouldn t have any problems .
it was recommended to have a soft slicker soft pin brush for my english cocker spaniel . because i plan on doing my cocker s grooming i wanted to introduce grooming tools in order of what i thought would be the least invasive . i have used this brush on my puppy s dry coat while she was relaxed on my lap . gently and lightly stroking through fine un matted fur my puppy jumped . after praising her for sitting so that i could try again she allowed me two strokes and started barking . i have tried multiple times since but my puppy will not have it . personally i like the grip on the handle it is very comfortable and easy to use . i have done the pin test on my hands and arms and do not have streaks from it . i am hoping this brush works as my puppy gets older maybe her skin is too sensitive and soft . for now i have to use the kong rubber slicker brush which she loves .the best grooming tool i have . my groomer advised me to get this comb and it really gets thru my goldendoodle s curly coatwell at least one of them love it . he falls asleep when i groom him with this . we had another bristle brush but it was way too stiff . i also use a pin brush greyhound comb and boar bristle brush on him . the other yorkies hates anything to do with bathing and grooming .
this little item saves you the hassle to carry picks everywhere wallet for example and lets you securely carry many picks with you . i tought it would include at least a courtesy pair of picks but it doesn t . i m not complaining about it but i think it would be a nice extra .great buy !i received all twelve picks which came in a small ziploc bag with an attached fender tag . the color is great . i needed a thin pick for some softer picking on acoustic . these work great though do not offer as warm a sound as rubber or felt picks . i find them to be the perfect compromise between heavy and rubber . the picks were reasonably priced and shipped via prime so i found them to be a great value as someone who only plays casually . thanks .spoi bought these to fill the dunlop pick holder that i also purchasd . nice selection . . .and the price was right .
i do like this for playing at home but it is what it is is by no means a replacement for my tnt peavey but works as it says and the shipping was quickthe item shipped in time . it is working fine . the sound is very good . the only problem i had is voltage . i live in europe and i had to buy special adapter which transforms volts to .i know a lot of items from usa that work with both voltage and but not this one .thanks anyway .i received the fender clipon chrome tuner in a very short time . i know it will live up to the finder name . very easy to use .
nicely made comb . i like the clip ring on the end and made of stainless steel will make this product last .container is made in a pretty heavy duty plastic the hinge where the lid connects to the container is pretty weak but aside from that the rest is pretty well made . the lid has a strip of rubber foam along the outside edge where it comes into contact with the lid of the container which provides an airtight seal .generally speaking pretty easy to use and is as described .worked like a charm on my aquaclear filter pipes . be careful though as the flexible metal structure can be quite flimsy 
great stapler . uses high quality staples . does not jam . does not warp the staple . not sure what else we look for in stapler but the kind of solid reliable staplers i like .this swingline model is a heavy duty stapler that will hold up to any kind of stapler jobs you need to do whether it is at home or at the office . it is a little pricier than some staplers but is well made and will last .this swingline model is a heavy duty stapler that will hold up to any kind of stapler jobs you need to do whether it is at home or at the office . it is a little pricier than some staplers but is well made and will last .

i use these instead of dish rags to wipe up small spills clean the bathroom dust the furniture and clean windows . not the same one of course . then i throw them in the wash and reuse them . make sure when you wash or put them in the dryer do not use a softener .fits right in the sink and is perfect for daring your dishes . i like it because i can wash my dishes stack them in here and give them a quick spray saving water in the meantime !really great stuff it can pick up dirt and easily be cleaned in the bucket really great if you are using a two bucket wash .
if you re looking to this pack to replace the pack that is sold now without the storage discs don t buy them ! they do not include the plastic storage disc cover either and are only a dollar or so cheaper than the pack . i think amazon sells the discs separately but you should still buy the pack instead of the pack . definitely not worth it and once i opened them to see if they contained the disc i couldn t return them .so the container they come in is a little hard to open and close for small children but no less the fact that it comes in it s own organizational container is very pleasing . the bottom of each of the dinosaurs states what dinosaur it is a model of . i use a set of flash cards with information about the dinosaurs in combination with these dinosaurs to teach my son while we play . these are nothing more than dinosaur figures but they are very accurate with no odd color combinations like purple with pink spots or something silly like that . they are made of hard durable plastic . i think they are slightly expensive for what they are you can buy similar products at the dollar store but those products like the educational value of these ones . overall i would recommend these my son finds them fun to play with and they stimulate his imagination . i only give them stars because they are slightly expensive .i purchased this bottle warmer for my second baby because it was a life saver for my daughter . it stores bottles in the compartment and comes with a small ice pack . do not store milk with this ice pack for more than eight hours . the pack is fairly small and does not cool the milk for long . i use a freezer pack and store one bottle at a time . i would add a time chart just to know approximately how much time it takes to heat up a bottle .
this works great . it s sturdy and fit s nice and snug in a standard gallon bucket . i will be ordering more of these in the future .just recived these prefect fit would tell any one in of these to buy these you wont besorry you didworks great . fairly easy swap . just be aware the front window regulators are the same on whether you have a suburban or tahoe or one of their gm family members . not so for the rear regulators . the full size suvs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones . the vehicle input feature amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference . the pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at but the vehicle id feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit . beware ! ! ! ! just so you know the dorman and fit the full size and the and fit the tahoe size vehicles .
being a musician i wanted something easy to bring with me to catch the jams . with the support of this little recorder i have about of what i have played over the last year available to me .sound quality there are many options to select from sample rate type mp wav and a number of other options . i have mainly recorded wav at when i am done recording i normally will edit it in a daw and then convert to mp for storage . i would say the audio is good not great but certainly right on for what i am doing considering the price . power is about hours of continuous recording . i can fit about hours on high quality on the gb card . this is usually a little more than i require when jamming . i have used the usb power when available and that has performed well .i have been pleasantly surprised with the audio levels . many times at a jam you don t necessarily get to pick an appropriate vantage point to record everyone equally . several times it had to sit next to the drummer or on the stairs or on the window sill in one case and i was worried about being able to pick up all the instruments but on the default settings it seems to pick everyone up and not get saturated . one instrument may be louder than another but then i tweak it adding compression and eq as necessary to further enhance .the only times it has failed has been i didn t have enough battery i didn t format the card and it ran out of room or i forgot to press the record button twice before recording . the first arms the track the second begins the recording . for the price i bought two and just keep one in my guitar case . . . i have not had reason to use the line in for the recorder just the external mics .just got this . it is my first pedal of any sort . it has many tones and a library of other settings i can play with . i just plug in my headphones and i am off in my own world when i play . i can change the sound of the guitar to match whatever i want or at least get close to what i want . i see myself using this for a good while before i need to upgrade . this also came with an ac adapter even though the box said it didn t .i bought this amp to use for practicing the electric guitar . there is so much debate out there about amps vs solid state this is a solid state . people will make ridiculous claims if you choose not to purchase a tube amp to practice through . you re not getting the right tone man . . . . the problem with that is there are several companies out there marshall fender vox orange etc . . . .and they all have a variety of tube amps to choose from and they all begin in price around this one . so i figured before i committed to a company maybe i could just use this fender to emulate some of those sounds i want .that worked out beautifully . though i am very much a beginner i have a greater appreciation for the nuances an amp s eq can have on your guitar s tone . i thought i needed pedals to have some of these effects instead i can just change the channel to a preset and there is all the flanger reverb modulation i need . i have got to the point where i understand about how just adjusting my volume switching pickups and using the built in guitar knobs can alter my tone enough to stand out when i want to .i would not have been able to do that without this amp . this amp helped me develop as a beginner so i wouldn t waste money buying other things beginners think they should get . excellent amp and i recommend getting this over the mustang ii . save the difference for your real amp that will come when you actually know a little more .
easy to apply and work fabulously . i just applied it to the front rail as we won t use the sides rails once the convertible crib is made into a bed . so for total protection buy two and cut one into the lengths of your side rails . apply early before you think you need it !this is a great product ! i have a sleigh style crib so it works great for us . we only had to cover sides of the crib rails and had a little left over . very easy to install and doesn t come off .our son uses the babi italia pinehurst classic crib . . .bought the ultimate crib sheet for it but it doesn t fit the crib very well . it is good for backup use if my other regular sheets are in the wash though . it just has problems fitting around the big corner crib rails so i am forced to attach the snaps on the regular rails instead which makes the sheet not be able to stretch to look completely flat .today i just found another use out of it though after feeling that it was a waste to buy this . my son has been pulling up to stand and teething on the top side rails and actually made teeth marks with paint coming off ! ah ! so i improvised and used this crib sheet to cover the top rail it fit perfectly in length and snaps perfectly together to stay on . it would have cost about the same price to buy an actual . . . rail cover so it works out . he usually only teethes on side too !
they do work . exactly as advertised . hane no fear on buying these . fit the chevy silverado wt tailgate rods .it worksworks just like it needs to . perfect fit for the tailgate on my chevy when the oem clip busted .
it s typical avery quality . as nice or nicer than the hallmark labeled brand at a more competitive price and produces quality cards .a word on photo quality . using a epson artisan printer with the correct paper will produce better photos than you will get at a typical photo lab . i highly recommend the epson photo papers as they are designed for the epson inks and the epson printers specifically . i tested the epson premium photo paper glossy and epson ultra premium photo paper glossy and recommend both . looking at the same image side by side on the two papers the differences are almost imperceptible . the detail and color are identical under the most careful scrutiny . a few differences emerge under very careful observation the ultra premium paper is slightly heavier paper this adds to its stiffness . when picking up a x photo from the edge there is about half as much bend vs the premium paper . the ultra premium paper has an iso brightness of versus for the premium paper . this makes no difference in color rich areas of photos but in light highlights if you stare long enough you can convince yourself they are brighter in the ultra premium . telling the difference in brightness requires good light identical photos side by side and far too much scrutiny . the premium costs about . cents per x sheet in packs of the ultra premium costs about . cents per x sheet in packs of given the quality differences are almost imperceptible and the price difference is almost double i d recommend the premium for every day use and the ultra premium only if you are entering a photo contest or have money burning a hole in your pocket . photos on the premium paper will be better than you d get at your local walgreens or costco .epson ultra premium photo paper glossy x sheets s balance and materials for higher quality prints and gallery showings . for me it rivals ilford and about half the cost .
this product works as advertised but you should beware . these are right angled and they will not fit in a lot of pedals including the crybaby wah .you have been warned ! ! !i have this paired with the behringer c studio condenser microphone . it matches the mic well color wise and fit . the c fits the mount perfectly . i recommend this mount highly .http www .amazon .com behringer c studio condenser microphone dp b cz rlk ref sr ?ie utf qid sr keywords behringer c works with a lot of mics and with a little modding it worked with my mxl v g which is all i needed it for .
i bought this for my stratocaster build and it works perfectly . the holes lined up it felt sturdy and it is a genuine fender part .it isn t completely black though . there is a white stripe running around the outer edge . not a problem for me but it may be for some .this was very easy to put together ! top just slips on the folding bottom part of stand and is very adjustable . love it !like many here the case could be an inch bigger . for my ibanez i cut the bottom material along the edge against the side wall enough to take out the bottom foam and then put the material back . now mine closes without pressure on the bridge .
there is an acceptable itsy bitsy leak left . you can watch fixing oil seal leaks fast video on youtube by scottykilmer . you need ounces for car engine or transmission usage and ounces for power steering . i am going to order more for power steering and transmission usage .this is a water additive that can potentially increase your cooling capacity by a few degrees by lowering surface tension and increasing boiling point .used to replace transmission fluid in acura integra automatic transmission perfect length funnel to preform this process . sits perfect above engine t pour fluid in . cap on hose is nice to prevent mess .
i don t know how this will work with other midi instruments but i tried it with the roland td drums and although it does transmit the data the drum map is totally off . the respective triggers hihat hihat pedal etc are translated into all sorts of wrong information and while you can manually compensate for some of it on the pc end of it it was just a freaking hassle . i needed this to be more flexible and able to record directly to my notebook which doesn t have a midi input but i gave up in the end and went with my desktop pc and its midi interface .i carry this in my bass gig bag so i can plug my phone into the mono aux input on the back of my genz benz bass head . handy for rehearsals when the band needs to listen to a track while working out an arrangement my bass cab is full range fearful . before picking this up i used a couple of cables adapters to go from stereo to mono and it often seemed i never had quite what i needed on hand .i m pretty new to using mics and pa systems but have used dynamic mics in the past recreationally . this condenser mic is way larger and heavier than a dynamic mic i was surprised when i took it out of the box . it is as good looking in person as in the pictures . three things for the benefit of other newbs . i learned that condenser mics are very susceptible to moisture and so you have to purchase a windscreen if you re going to use this for vocals since moisture from singing into the mic can damage it . . this has a cardioid pickup pattern you don t sing directly into the end of the mic like a dynamic mic . this should stand straight up on a mic stand paying attention to which way the mic is facing since it there will be a lot of attenuation on one side of it . . it requires phantom power . you need a pa that provides v power to use it .when i first used this mic i tried singing into the end of it and couldn t hear myself very well . later in the evening i was standing off to the side and could hear myself so loud that i had to back away about a foot from the mic . then i remembered reading about the cardioid pattern and stood it up straight on the mic stand paying attention to the orientation of the mic . it was so sensitive that i really had to stay backed up from the mic and it was easy for two or three people to stand around it for vocals . i have a rainsong ws acoustic electric guitar i was playing and was able to turn off my amp completely because this mic picked up the instrument and my vocals so clearly . other musicians were impressed by it as well . i payed just under a for it which i think is a great value for this product .
they do work . exactly as advertised . hane no fear on buying these . fit the chevy silverado wt tailgate rods .this was a fraction of the price of the ones at the store and fit perfectly for my lexus rx awd .this is a very solid product . i had purchased another brand that claimed to be universal but it did not fit the larger airstream coupler . the product fit although i did have to turn it backward key hole facing the trailer .
i ordered these tire irons to change the tires on my buell blast the fact that they include a pouch to keep the tire irons in is a great addition . i used them to mount my rear tire pirelli diablo and it really held up to the job . i was think that with the way that i was cranking on these that it would bend but not so . i would have to agree with other reviews that to have another pack so that i would have tire irons to use while mounting is a good idea . i know it ups the price a bit but it s worth it . i did get my tire mounted with just two but i did notice there was a point where i wouldn t have minded having a rd . . .great tire iron i would recommend these . .after my local bmw motorrad dealer nicked my cast alloy rims on the last tire change i decided they would never work on my bike again . so now i change tires myself and these tools are excellent for the job i use plastic rim shields to prevent rim damage . mine have gray handles but say usa on them so i believe they are indeed made domestically which is another big plus .tire repair kit was purchased in the event i get a flat tire having no spare . i got rid of those terrible riding runflat tires and decided to carry a small air compressor and these plugs . just hope i don t ever need either but there s always aaa .
the picture is slightly misleading . this is only the mounting bracket it does not come with any wiring . but is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a wire flat cable . the bracket is flat on one side and curved on the other . the curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch . the connector on the end of my t connector fits well and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket . it sure beets having the connector flopping around !very quick and easy mounting and really adds to the look of the rear of the jeep . these are metal and not a cheap plastic and mount with included screws into the existing lens cover screw holes .needed to replace a broken mirror . this one fit right onto the existing metal holder that was still cemented to the windshield . it has a lock screw to hold it in place . if you need to replace the metal holder it is included but no glue is supplied . overall it is a perfectly fine basic mirror .
durable pups seem to like it can be used indoors or outside . the pups have been able tear it apart .i love this leash for my dog . my dog enjoys it as well because he can go more places . my dog is a small dog and i got a med . size leash for him because he can pull real well and he loves the extra long leash .i ve owned trained and titled dogs for over yrs now . these leads have improved using the newer stronger strap system the old ones were terribly heavy . being german made you know they are well built . i own two black russian terriers both well over lbs and my male is as strong as any dog i ve ever owned or trained .these are not training tools or for dummies who try and stick their hand out to stop the leash and get burned that is stupidity . the lead has a hand brake that works excellently .i ve used these leads on my rottweilers too . i don t use them for training just hikes and long walks . i even used them for tracking puppies until they are used to tracking leads .use the lead for what it was intended for and they are great it allows your dog s to walk freely and leave their marks and stool bombs without having the lead to always pull in by hand . short leads for dogs especially young dogs hate them for bathroom runs . flexi s work wonders .training leads are for training dogs flexi leads are for trained dogs . duh . . . .
this is the large ? i can t see how anything any smaller could be of any use at all . the lines for the strings and frets are very close together .the harmonica barely fits the holder and there is no adjustment for distance from the mouth to the harmonica . i can t get the harmonica adjusted close enough to play it unless i modify it .item is really convienient . small unobtrusive size w good illumination for easy reading . i like the swivel design swivel display that allow you to connect it to whatever side of the headstock you want . price can t be beat either .
i received my order today and as other have mentioned there is only one cap although the pictures show a package containing two . i re read the information given and it does not make it clear that there is only one . at that number the price is outrageous . go to a pet store . they are much cheaper there .half the cost of month front line with individual packets sold in stores . just open the large dose packet pour it into the amber colored container draw the proper dose out of the container with the needleless syringe apply to your dog .i just received my order today .the box does have individual doses .this is what it says it is .
i thought i d write a short review as i have a friend who owns one nd i wish i had gotten one instead of my big stroller . i got a system stroller the kind you can put a car seat in or use as a stroller and it was nice but it just did not get used much . my shopping cart cover is what sees the most wear tear ! one of these snap go jobs would have been great and i would have spent instead of for about the same thing ! it has all you want while your little one is in an infant car seat and you will find that as your baby gets bigger you might change your mind about the kind of long term stroller you would like . i found i needed a double stroller as i ended up with another baby in mos ! or you may find you will desire a jogger or just an umbrella stroller later . the point is this is perfect as a first stroller and for those on a budget it s a great option not to mention that you won t have to tote a heavy big stroller just to carry your car seat bound baby !i actually am one of those moms who bought a fancy travel system but i ended up sticking it in the closet and using this stroller most of the time ! it is so much more convenient . initially i bought the snap n go just for travel to accomodate the car seat provided by the rental car company but i loved it so much i kept using it at home . i can grab it out of my trunk and it literally falls open ready to go don t worry there is a clip to keep it closed for when you need it ! . so incredibly easy . don t underestimate how much you will appreciate having a cup holders that actually accomodate different sized containers b a tray area for your keys cell phone etc . c a huge basket so you don t have to cram everything under the stroller d wide set wheels so you won t constantly be kicking the stroller when walking e great turning smooth rolling f a stroller you don t have to fiddle with for minutes to get your carseat attached . it really is a great product . only downside . . . .hard to find a solution for shading the sun . note . . .obviously this stroller has no educational value ! but i m being forced to provide a rating for all categories so i ll just give it a for everything . this was on my must have list . the plan . . .to use it in my perego p to snuggle my little peanut and protect his head from the detachable back strap . i bought the snuzzler with every intention to use it but i haven t . i haven t used it in his p because i ended up buying the kolcraft universal car seat carrier . i m not using it in his infant car seat because i m already using a jj cole bundle me . it would be too bulky . i tried it in his swing but it creates to tight of a fit . i tried it in his bouncer . . .can t snap him in . . .too bulky . so why would i rate if i haven t even used it ? that s basically it . is it worth buying something you may not even use . my advice would be to be sure you are going to use it before making the purchase .
we use these to put color logos on the inside of the plate for display on the front of the vehicle . back ground can be painted in on the inside of the plate for better contrast .this comes with rubber feet that you install on the bottom . each foot is circular with a slot running from one side to the other that perfectly fits around the metal grate on top of rv stoves . the board itself has pre drilled pilot holes and a template that allows you to determine which holes to use for your particular stove . it s a very well done product . the feet keep the unit in place during travel but it comes off easily when you want to use the stove . the finish is very nice too so it looks excellent in place . highly recommend .this is a sturdy and inexpensive license plate holder that allows for the plate to sit on the edge of the holder because of it s design . good product .
i love our co sleeper ! ! ! we have twin boys and they are weeks and just now transitioning into their cribs . they have sleep in the co sleeper since coming home and it is perfect ! the original size is great for twins or for one baby who is bigger . the weight limit is lbs . for the higher level which sold us as the pack n plays are only lbs . i can t recommend this enough it truly has been a lifesaver to just reach over and have access to a baby . you can also buy lifts but our bed is pretty tall and we didn t need them .love the co sleeper . i have twins and both fit in it great . our bed is an average height and the sleeper is still too short to be right next to it though . wish it was just a little taller . the fitted sheet for the bassinet does stain easy but overall great product .we bought this because we loved the idea of having our baby be able to sleep next to us in bed without the dangers of being in the same bed . this co sleeper allows me to see and rub him if i need to without getting out of bed . the bassinet just seemed akward next to the bed . the co sleeper has a siderail that can be lowered so it almost feels like your baby is in bed with you but it s much safer . at first it was hard to put up down and we thought it was broken but once you figure out how to work it it s easy . i think whether you buy the mini or regular size just depends on personal preference or room size . i purchased the mini because i didn t think we would have our baby in it for very long and the mini would be big enough to serve it s purpose but my son is months old and although he doesn t sleep in it he still likes to sit in it next to our bed . the sheets are expensive . but i bought the koala cradle bassinet sheets from babies r us for . each and they fit perfect ! i m so happy with this purchase and can t imagine what i would have done without it .
i primarily use this as an usb adapter for my headphones so that i can connect convert the . mm headphone jack into my pc .the audio adapter is well built . it has a yellow led light that is solid when plugged into an usb port and blinks when there is a device that is connected to it through a . mm jack .installation was flawless . windows bit installed drivers immediately .no issues . no nonsense . simply works !should you need to connect a condenser microphone to a phantom power box so that it will work with an ordinary amplifier or mixer without phantom supply this is a good length for the link .the behringer usb premium input mixer is just what the doctor ordered . nice unit and works perfectly for vocals guitar bass guitar and keyboards . don t lock yourself down with a bad usb cable
this piping works great . it does everything its supposed to do . fits nicely on my air pump and my aerating stone .works just as i thought . it s sturdy and looks nice . this can be used for almost any bird or small animal cage . it s a nice shelf they can sit on .it s aquarium airline and it works . nothing else to say really it s one of those simple products that does exactly what it is designed to do .
this cover does not fit a full size acoustic electric hohner guitar . i measured the whole at but this cover does not even come close to fitting ! it measures in diameter so check your guitar closely !this is a great value . i contacted the company for measurements inside the case to see if it would fit an ibanez rg series . it fits perfectly . thank youas a lot of epiphone owners have learned cases designed for the gibson es clones won t fit epiphone guitars as the epiphones have a slightly larger headstock . this case however fits my dot custom like a glove . the padding is perfect the top is arched to precisely fit the guitar and the build quality is better than you might expect at this price level .
the product works very well based upon condition of your interior . it will not make your car new but it does work . hope this helps .highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering suspension work . you will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover .i hate to use the pickle fork . the pickle fork is the last resort for me as it will damage the balljoint boot .i prefer to use the snap on balljoint remover . if that one cannot fit then i will try this tool . if this tool will not fit then i will resort to a pickle fork .this item does what it s supposed to do protect the tow ball . i m very satisfied with my purchase . the price was reasonable and it works . what more can you ask for ?
because of the shape of this phone it will not charge in my answering machine unit . you can get it to talk to the other units by taking off the battery cover and putting it in the base . but you need to charge it in its own cradle . that can be a pain sometimes . i do like the navigation system on it better than my original handset from the .i have my electrical phones and cellular in the house . however here in miami we do get serious storms and hurricanes during which time electrical phones do not function . therefore i have now this extra unit connected to my printer scanner which i use while sitting at my pc and should we have a hurricane can transfer to my bedroom for regular communications . you will be surprised how many time the phone lines do not go down but you cannot use the other phones because there is no electricity ! great deal . only wish it had lights on the buttons which i believe is supposed to have but i don t see them at least on mine .the uniden tcx offers all the same features as the handsets that came with several other multi handset uniden phones . it is a solid phone handset with the . gigahertz frequency ranking as one of this phone s greatest attractions . i have found that i can stray a good distance from the base and it will still function normally . my home and yard are not huge but i still had problems with fading signals with my older phone . i often had to reposition myself if i was outside in order to get my old cordless phone to receive the signal . but with uniden tcx there is no need to reposition myself or the phone . the signal is still clear even when i am standing in the corner of my property .the lcd display on the uniden tcx is nice . it isn t very large but it lights up in an orange color and it shows many bits of information like the date and time the phone number and name of a caller when an incoming call is trying to ring through a battery charge indicator an indicator telling you the number of different caller id s that have come through and an indicator telling you which handset you are using you can program each one with its own number . the lcd contrast and the ring volume can be adjusted on each handset making it customizable per room . you can even change the display to read in english spanish or french .uniden tcx is compatible with many different uniden phone systems . but in order for this expansion handset to work it must first be programmed with your main phone . this requires entering specific code numbers into your main phone s base unit . if you do not program the phone will not work . programming is simple instructions are included for programming into different main phones and it must be completed or the phone will be worthless .there are only a few things about the uniden tcx phone that are deserving of criticism . first it can get a little tedious trying to program new names and numbers and one needs to be careful not to get carried away because it can take a long time to get everything programmed just right using abbreviations is a good idea to speed up the process . second i don t like the flashing red light in the upper left hand corner of each handset . this is a charge indicator that lets you know the phone is charged and ready to go . there is nothing wrong with letting consumers know this but to have a light that continuously flashes can be a tremendous distraction . third the base is small and light and it can easily get knocked off the table or desk on which it rests . fourth i would prefer a plug that didn t have a block attached to it . this makes it easy to grip but it also means the plug has to be inserted a certain way or it will partially cover the electrical outlet directly underneath it .overall in spite of a few inconveniences i am still satisfied with the purchase of my uniden trx handset and i may add another one or two handsets like it in the future . they sell for a reasonable price and they are compatible with many different uniden phones . clear sound slim design and countless features make this auxiliary phone a nice addition to any uniden household in need of extra phone units .
this is an excellent basic binder . it s a usable medium size with slightly stiff round rings and a handy fold out front cover . the cover is an inoffensive shade of white . a sheet of thin clear plastic is wrapped all the way around the outside providing slots to slip in a full sheet of title cover paper at both front and back plus a strip of paper to label the spine . likewise a strip of the same plastic extends all the way around the inside to about a third of the height of the binder . this provides front and back slots to slip in a sheet or two of paper that you haven t gotten around to punching . i buy such binders six or so at a time .this is your basic everyday three round ring binder . nothing outstanding . pvc free .i think attaching the ring assembly to the back cover instead of the spine might make it a little stronger . my personal opinion is this binder would be perfectly adequate for storage but i m not sure how it would hold up to every day use by a student especially in a book bag . i don t know why they say the inside pockets are opaque . they re transparent like the outer over covers inches tall . they would be handy for an index card contents list etc . you can customize the front and spine with your own designs or labels behind the clear over lays .it comes in basic blue black and white . it had never occurred to me before but i suppose the binder size refers to the height of the rings not the width of the spine . i don t guess that s an earth shaking difference but it might make a difference if you re multiplying the width by the number of binders you can fit on a specific shelf . the width of this binder is actually inches wide .long . x and solid .not your typical x box the fellowes boxes are heavy have reinforced holes where they are tied shut a plastic pull out handle on one end and the usual holes on both sides for lifting . straight for stacking that xtra length sure is welcomed !perfect for magazines comics documents and easy to fold together .
it s a depth gauge . not much to it it does the job so you can better measure how much tire tread you have left . handy when you re looking to replace a tire and debating on whether or not you need to replace two tire or have the new one shaved down . a handy little tool .i bought this because i was in need of one for my car . it is simple to use and does the job for an inexpensive tire gauge . you can use it to measure your current tire gauge as well as deflate your tire if you have too much air .my experience with slime has been limited to bicycle tires where the product does a good job sealing up pinhole and other small punctures in the tire tube . i have never used slime in an automobile tire but since the materials are basically the same i would assume that the product would work in a similar way .for an automobile where the flat occurs makes a big difference . if your car is parked and notice your tire is flat this kit would probably be quite useful . you can at least use the compressor to pump up the tire and check how bad the leak is . if it is a fast leak you can try using the slime and see if it takes care of the problem . the car does not need to be jacked up to use the product .if the puncture happens when the car is being driven the problem is more serious . when you drive on tire that is significantly deflated or flat most times you will do heavy duty damage or tear the tire . if that happens slime won t help . the tire will need to be replaced . the instructions state that slime will not work on punctures greater than inch . so basically slime is intended to address only minor tire damage .the smart spair kit is a pretty good deal . it consists of a ounce bottle of slime and a compressor which plugs into the lighter outlet . according to the label a ounce bottle should be adequate to treat one averaged sized tire . the ounce bottle is available at amazon for about nine dollars . subtract this cost from the price of the kit and you are getting the compressor for less than fifteen dollars which is not a bad deal . the compressor has a pressure valve ten foot cord and on off switch . it is pretty noisy and seems to have a reasonably quick pump rate . it is rated for use on a minimum amp circuit . some older cars have lighter circuits rated at only amps so you may want to check this before you buy .hopefully i will not have to use the smart spair . based on the good though limited experience i have with slime i thought it would be good to have around just in case . there are many situations where changing a tire at the side of the road can be hazardous . a kit like this could be valuable to those that are not capable of jacking up their vehicle and changing the tire . it does not take a mechanical genius to follow the directions .
reads the temp in c or f and seems accurate .it does what it is meant to do and does it very wellthis works perfectly with my aquarium exact temperature is displayed and also a convenient green zone marked to know the temperature for tropical fish .this does the job but it is hard to get an exact temp with this .you can see the zone of say to degrees f but you can t getan exact temp with it . if you want to keep your tank at an exact degrees f then you should get a different thermometer soyou know for sure . otherwise it is fine and is better than thestick on temp meter .
these are terrific every day labels . i ve tried them on both my laser and inkjet printers and have had no issues with smudging or jamming .the labels are thick enough that they don t appear see through . they hold ink well . the adhesive is very strong no worries that the labels will peel off in the mail .i highly recommend these for you everyday no frills address labels .these are wonderful . they go thru clean and the edges tear well . as long as you use them according to the directions these look almost like you had them done professionally . they can be used on laser but are specifically designed for ink jet which accepts ink differently .the avery easy peel labels are really easy to work with . my inkjet ink doesn t smudge and the labels are super easy to peel . i highly recommend them .
the x inch mirrors are a good fit for honda pilot . i had to order via amazon since i couldn t find these anywhere it appears local auto stores only carry the x inch size . these little blind spot mirrors are a must buy item they cover the blind spots on either side of the vehicle very well .would recommend getting a size smaller than what the sizing chart recommends as i measure aroun my leg as recommended and the chaps were one size too large . . otherwise they are awesome quality and buildsizes listed in reviews and the two in the description . x . x and . x . x don t match to what i received . . .the bag i received is in between what has been listed in the descriptions . x x empty .while seemingly a good quality bag with a fair amount of straps and attached rain cover hidden in the heel of the bag it seems the manufacturer or seller has no idea how to use a measuring tape !the bag itself is quite nice . . . good padding rubberized bottom to prevent sliding small pockets on either side and zippers seem of reasonable quality .for the price and bag quality i m not complaining . it works great on my cb and it does fit on the pillion of my vt c without having to remove my rider backrest so if you have standard seating or a touring adventure style this bag will do well for you as a pillion bag and with a little strap adjustments it also fits vertical on the front or back of a sissy bar or horizontal on a larger luggage rack . . .
i have to say i have not been disappointed with this warmer other than it should not be used with the playtex inserts bottles which is why it gets stars as it cannot sense the heat properly and makes them way too hot and doesn t shut off . my best advice ? read the directions ! i was shocked at how little water it uses and thought i was reading it wrong . do not use more water than the directions say for your bottle size ! it is correct and when followed it heats the bottle perfectly every time . all of the water disappeared and the light turns off when it s done . i honestly cannot understand how people could say they read the directions and it still didn t work but hey that s just me . definitely recommend ! if you have the inserts you can always use a plastic bottle and pour it in . a must have for when baby is home with daddy grandma or anyone else that doesn t have a ton of experience with properly heating a bottle esp . breastmilk .do not buy for glass bottles . says nothing about this on the website but on the box . very dangerous because gets so hoti was looking for something that can let me use my medela pump and pump right into my avent bottles and found this adaptor to use . i usually pump and feed right away so this saves me using the medela pump bottles and then pouring into another avent bottle . the only thing is you must remember to put the adaptor ring on the avent bottle before you put this adaptor on if not it will leak if you don t stay upright . this package comes with the adaptors for the avent nurser kit too but i ve never use it and i wish they just sell them separately .
this little jewel is so small it can hide in your hand but it delivers decent tone at a decent volume to your headphones for practicing indoors or outdoors over traffic sounds even . its ts plug goes directly into your bass s instrument cable jack and it has one trs output jack for your headphone plug . but it also has a second trs input jack which allows you to connect your computer or mp player or cell phone so you can hear yourself playing over play alongs or any such music source both directly into your headphones .its on off switch has a third position for overdrive distortion which i never use . it has both gain and volume output controls and both work . it also has a tone control but i cannot discern that it does anything . could be that i just have a defective sample but i don t care because the tone is fine just as it is .others have described this little headphone amp as seeming somewhat fragile and i don t argue with that it does feel a bit thinly made and the xaaa battery door does seem weak . but i just take a little extra care not to drop it or bang it around in a gig bag . if the battery door eventually falls off i ll use duct tape and when this little thing completely wears out i ll buy another . it s just too handy and easy to travel with not to own and as i said it does the job .edit still working fine .i don t know how this will work with other midi instruments but i tried it with the roland td drums and although it does transmit the data the drum map is totally off . the respective triggers hihat hihat pedal etc are translated into all sorts of wrong information and while you can manually compensate for some of it on the pc end of it it was just a freaking hassle . i needed this to be more flexible and able to record directly to my notebook which doesn t have a midi input but i gave up in the end and went with my desktop pc and its midi interface .this gadget works fine to connect an electric guitar to an ipad or iphone or a computer but the particular one i received has a defective input socket for a inch audio plug . it doesn t snap in place . just sits there waiting to let the plug slide out . that makes it fairly useless . i may have simply gotten a defective one .
this stand is designed to work on electric guitars not acoustic or acoustic electric guitars . the arms that support the guitar are short and not adequate for acoustic guitars . this is however perfect for my lp and sg guitars . i love its size and portability .love it i finally found one that supports my strings alvarez jumbo acoustic guitari started experimenting on strings i say why wouldn t i try to use bronze strings for my acoustic guitar ? awesome i like the brightness of sound it produced . i m hooked to bronze strings . thanks to martin for making the best bronze acoustic guitar strings !
i use these for aftermarket batteries for v power wheels . can charge with a battery tender and fit together nicelyof all the battery chargers on the market the battery tender is the best . the device is small and portable works exceptionally well for maintaining batteries and does not over charge over charging can decrease the overall life of your battery . it is simple to operate and can be left hooked up to a dormant battery while it is not in use . the battery tender can be used while the battery is hooked up to a vehicle mower etc . or not . highly recommended . i comparison shop a lot before buying anything hopefully you can benefit from my time investment and review .the battery tender alligator clips allow me to charge a battery without having to install the ring type terminals on the positive and negative posts . i can also charge a battery without having to remove it from a vehicle or removing the cables from the battery . a very handy item to use with my deltran bank charger .
one way check valve . not a real big deal .comes with hoses and clamp as pictured . i think it even comes with a sticker .what is there to say ? comes with for the spare . kind of sucks they never include a spare wheel key .bottle came as described have not had to use it but it comes with the tpms safe sealant in most flat kits .
the picture is slightly misleading . this is only the mounting bracket it does not come with any wiring . but is is well designed to let you securely mount the end connector of a wire flat cable . the bracket is flat on one side and curved on the other . the curved side fits well on the tube of my trailer hitch . the connector on the end of my t connector fits well and the weather cap comes out through a slot in the bracket . it sure beets having the connector flopping around !installed this with a curt hitch on a crv . it plugs into the ready made connection by the driver side quarter panel . i store the extra cord beneath the table in the storage area and just run the cord out through the rear door when towing . the weatherstripping protects the wiring from damage . very easy and no splicing and wiring to mess with . hope this review helps .i purchased this to be able to attach a high end hydraulic assisted bike rake on the back of my jeeps jks with the rear tire still on . it fit perfectly and teamed with the bolt lock blt receiver lock keyed specifically for your line of vehicle it can be kept in the jeep and my daughter doesn t need anything but her car key .the extender is exactly as advertised well made fit perfectly and does eactly what it is inteded for .
i bought this samsung printer to replace my college age daughter s brother laser printer to work with her macbook . the samsung s price small size and company reputation convinced me to get this and i m glad i did . the printer comes with two cds one for windows vista and one for non specified os which definitely contains the drivers for macs os x . and up . windows me nt and several linux os red hat fedora core mandrake . . and suse . . are also supported . i was able to get the printer up and running on two different macs with different versions of os x within minutes .a power cord paper dust cover and a laser toner cartridge are also included . customers will have to purchase separately a usb to printer cable such as belkin f u pro series hi speed usb cable six feet or use whatever they use now to hook up their computer . the speed is decent up to ppm and the quality is typical monochrome laser . although it is a little noisy on start up this compact laser printer prints smoothly and relatively quietly once it gets going .don t expect heavy duty construction . it weighs a lot less than most laser printers and the price reflects it . still this creates a high quality end product for those on a budget or with limited shelf space . also look at brother hl monochrome laser printer debbie lee wesselmannthe avery white x inch ink jet printer labels work just as expected . they adhere well and are easy to print . most label printing programs should be able to handle this standard size and templates exist for programs such as word if needed . a solid choice for half sheet labels .almost any address will fit . even long complicated five line addresses just use smaller font size line spacing . the brother p touch software gives you complete freedom with the label appearance . these work great withql printer . note printer automatically cuts each new label from the roll
i just can t seem to get comfortable with this big pillow . i ve heard that some people love it and can t sleep without it during pregnancy . . . i m not one of those people .i read the reviews about the smell but since most of the reviews were positive i hoped that was an old solved problem . the chest arrive and was spacious and cute . my tot liked opening the lid and would not get hurt running into it . but the smell was noxious ! it smells like just produced toxic plastic . i aired it out for weeks ! in another room . then taking drastic measures realizing that it ruins the chance of return but hoping to keep this oh so cute box i dunked it into a cold bath . after it dried which it did without any problems btw it still smelled . so did the toys left in it overnight . sadly the chest went to the curb . . .i m using this pillow for about a week now and here s what i noticed .i m at weeks and my belly is not too big but it still caused me a lot of trouble while sleeping . i had to spend about minutes every night getting comfortable enough with all the pillows and of course by the time i do pretty much i d have to get up and go to the bathroom i now use the snoogle pillow along with only ! extra pillows and it does help .i ll skip the pros part as the other reviewers did a good job describing them . but here are the cons that could definetely be improved by the manufacturer . the seam that goes all the way on the inside curve of the pillow is very stiff when the pillow is stretched around your body . this is very uncomfortable as i usually feel it either on my shoulder neck or the chest depending on the position i take .it is touching all those soft areas and feels almost like a cardboard across the skin . . the fabric of the pillow is kind of rough and it is not too pleasant for the skin of the face . i am thinking about sewing the case out of the softer fabric but it could be a little complicated because of the odd shape and the length of the pillow . . the price . it has been mentioned before that the pillow itself is very simple made so i guess it s the idea that costs that much .all these items could probably be improved by the manufacturer so the product really does make a perfect pregnancy product .
this chair was very useful because the tray and the seat belt really anchors the child into the chair my yr old son already figured out how to get free of typical restaurant high chairs with seat belts . and the height change option is nice to have have not used it yet . the removable white sectional plate and plate cover ended up completely useless for me personally .although i have a basic fisher price booster seat as well as this deluxe booster seat we have children my husband mainly prefers using our brica high chair sear cover with disposable placemats to reduce of big bulky items to bring to the restaurant .grandma was not ready to give up leather seating in her car and wanted something to protect the leather from damage when a booster seat was installed . the prince lionheart two stage seat saver seemed to be what i was looking for . not only was it somewhat more rigid than other seat protectors but it came in tan so that it matched my car s interior . additionally since i live in south texas the lighter color is more desirable for purposes of keeping the vehicle s interior from getting so hot . there should be no issue with the seat saver staining the lighter leather black as based on reviewers comments some other brands do .the prince lionheart two stage seat saver was easy to install . the base filled one of the back bucket seats the seat saver s back needed to have been about longer to completely protect the booster seat back from coming in contact with the vehicle s seat . further it would have been helpful if each side of the prince lionheart two stage seat saver had tabs that extended over the seat back . that would have prevented the booster seat straps from digging into the vehicle s seat when the booster seat was correctly installed . because of the vehicle s seat depth the prince lionheart two stage seat saver s front flap does not bend at the marked area but still provides a bit of protection to the seat edge . having a little one who likes to drum his feet makes me appreciate this feature i do wish the flap had been a bit longer and had multiple grooves for bending .there was no sliding of the britax frontier sict booster seat which was installed on this seat saver the booster seat held firmly in place . the backing on the prince lionheart two stage seat saver is a rubber like mesh similar to the material used to keep floor rugs from sliding . since i have not yet had the seat in place during one of our very hot texas summers i do not know whether there will be a sticking problem . i will probably remove the booster seat during the summer unless our little one is visiting so that i can avoid this potential problem .i would have rated the prince lionheart two stage seat saver a . if that rating had been available . with the exception of the suggested changes i am very pleased with this product .this potty seat is simple comfortable and easy to use . i have only found one toilet that it did not fit on . only potty seat we ll use for our kids . we love it ! seat is made in sweden .
pros small footprint relatively quiet good quality printouts uses the hp a cartridge this size cartridge is rated for pages vs hp successor cartridges for personal laser printers eg hp a cartridge which is rated for pages refurbished toner cartridges are widely available cons no windows drivers compared to my previous printer samsung ml the prints a lot slower especially noticeable with multi page pdf documents in conclusion this is a good little printer for light occasional use .i previously gave this printer stars . however beware . if you print say pages in a row the printer slows from its rated throughput to only ca . pages per minute . hp tech support confirms this and indicates that a cheap printer without a fan overheats and compensates by stopping the continuous printing . . .it could not be expected to do any better . then why is it rated at ppm ?what nonsense . the printer is misrepresented . if you only print a couple of pages at a time then this is fine . but if you print out program code or book or article manuscripts this is a big problem .all things being equal i would have to call the hp officejet one of the best all around printers copiers scanners around . i have reviewed enough all in one units now to appreciate a great model when i get to play with one and after a month of testing i can honestly say that the officejet has really impressed me .printing is probably the main reason anyone would purchase this unit . the print quality is simply fantastic . printing text only pages is very very fast much quicker than i was expecting from an ink jet printer . so quick in fact that my nine year old daughter even commented on it just this morning . i used the officejet to print out a letter to her school . she asked which printer it would come out and i pointed to the hp . it was done printing just a few seconds later . her reaction ? wow that was a lot faster than the silver and black printer . the silver and black printer being the lexmark i reviewed back in june .fast is not always good if the print quality is not up to par . the officejet has nothing to fear . using standard high gloss photo paper and printing a photo from iphoto i was simply amazed at the print quality . i have printed many full page color photos over the last few years and i can honestly say that the officejet s print quality is one of the best for an ink jet printer . while no speed demon printing a full page color print the print time was respectable .paper is loaded from the bottom front of the unit so it is much easier to see how much paper you have left at a quick glance . not so with a rear upwards facing paper tray such as those found on most lexmark epson and other printers . i much prefer a lower front loading tray to the other types . my only grip here is that there is no protective cover for the paper tray meaning that if you don t print something every few days dust will accumulate and be run through your printer when you do .be aware that the officejet is not a post script printer so graphic professionals will want to look elsewhere . there is also no built in print sharing with the officejet nor is it compatible with rendezvous but you can share it via usb print sharing built in to os x .speaking of os x if you are not using mac os x or mac os . and are still a happy os . or earlier user you are out of luck . like many programs and hardware coming out as of late the officejet is not compatible with pre os x operating systems . nor is it compatible with windows nt . or dos either . scanning is done via the hp director software which you can only get from the included cd rom . to deviate from the standard review process for a moment i would like to point out that hp while having great products for the most part has a woefully inadequate support website . the above mentioned hp director software cannot be downloaded via their website . when mac os x . was released i had some initial problems printing to the officejet . the problem was unrelated to the hp software but in my search for a cure i did learn of the poor quality of hp s support pages . what happens if i loose or scratch my hp cd rom ? i have to order another one . and as of today s date there is still no software update for the software on hp s website . the same software hp director also controls their digital cameras with their hp director camera . there is also no update for that program online even though i cannot get it to work under . correctly . for a company the size and with the reputation they have i expect better from hp .getting back to the officejet and scanning i have found that the scanning works great . while i don t especially like the scanning software the officejet ships with it does work well . you can access the software directly through adobe photoshop as well via the import hp all in one scan in the file menu . you can scan photos or documents from x dpi up to x dpi . the flatbed scanner performs about the same as most other scanners and copiers in this price range and there is nothing here . it work fine has an auto crop feature etc . . .the true strength of scanning however if the page top load automatic document feeder on top of the officejet . you can set the printer to scan multiple documents not pictures up to pages which is a great feature one many small or home business users will appreciate .usually when reviewing a multi function printer scanner fax machine the fax aspect is the least impressive . using built in fax software you have to have your computer turned on to control send or receive a fax . not so with the officejet ! hp realizing how nice it would be to be able to send and receive faxes has taken the need to have a computer out of the equation . simply plug the officejet into your phone jack and you can control all the fax features from the built in lcd display . this is a great feature one i overlooked when my testing first started . i now feel that this is one of the best selling points to the unit and one i did not realized i missed so much from other units .specification print quality x dpiconnectivity usbprint speed black up to ppmprint speed color up to ppmcompatible operating systems microsoft windows se me xp macintosh os . os xscanner type flatbedautomatic document feeder sheetsmedia sizes letter legal executive cards x to . x in using adf color fax yesfax transmission speed sec per pagefax memory pagesfax autoredial yesfax pc interface yes sending onlyfax auto reduction yesfax delayed sending yescopy speed black up to cpmcopy speed color up to cpmcopy settings stand alone copying fit to page from glass only reduce enlargemaximum number of copies up to copiesbit depth bitlevels of grayscale software included hp photo and imaging gallery hp director hp photo gallery hp image editor hp instant share hp photo prints hp creative projects hp quick x prints hp memories disc dvd creator readiris ocr hp send to programsdimensions w x d x h x . x . in x . x . with tray fully extended weight . lbwarranty one year limited hardware warranty backed by hp customer care service and support one year technical phone support plus a toll free number in north america onlythis is a great printer for both the new and veteran computer user wanting an all in one printing solution . fantastic execution in functionality and usability . small compact design in an attractive package .well worth the money and investment .mymac rating out of 
we have three of these and they are working very well in our two story house . it is great all around with just a few minor complaints the ringer has just two volume levels . however one can use different rings to soften the sound if you need to fine tune it . when using the intercom mode your own phone rings . i d like to be able to call down to my wife if i need something for our sleeping baby but i can t because the ringing of my own phone would wake up the baby . i don t know why my own phone should ring . the room monitor is convenient . i know it is a phone and not a baby monitor but i use it for that on monitoring mode . it would be nice if a light could flash at a certain noise threshold . the answering machine volume is the same as the welcome message screening volume . i like to turn the volume up to listen to messages . if i forget to turn it down again the next time the phone rings the welcome message is very loud possibly waking the house or broadcasting your callers message to guests . the only way to turn down the volume is to turn on the speaker phone and then lower the volume . using the handset to check messages is a nice feature . however the default is speaker on the handset for this so i have to quickly turn speaker off when checking messages . i use the headset to listen privately in case it is something i don t want my kids to hear so i d like it to default to having the speaker off .again i d like to say these are great phones with good sound and they have been very durable despite being in my year olds grasp more times than i care to mention .i m happy with this phone . only thing that i don t like is that the ringer volume on the low setting is still quite loud . it s either got an extremely loud ring or a very loud ring . no quiet ring option . aside from that the phone works great and has all of the features i need . and for the amazon price you can t beat it !i purchased this phone used because i managed to break my plantronics ct which i loved . . .okay maybe that s a strong word but i liked it a lot .at the time i did conference calls at night about hours in length about times a week .for the most part sound quality distance from the base unit reception battery life were all comparable to the ct .but there were things this unit that made this unit not as good as the ct .weird effect on my wireless laptop i know nothing about radio frequencies or such but the minute i would turn on this head set to make a call near my wireless dell laptop my laptop would lose the wireless signal . once the phone was off it was fine . this wasn t a fluke but quite repeatable as it fascinated me . my house cordless phone did not have this effect .no audible mute indicator and a fussy mute button when you are on a conference call for a long time you get up and wander sometimes you cough or want to blow your nose and knowing you are on mute is essential . on this unit i had to look at it to tell and with it s black on gray display it was only visible in well lit areas . the ct since it had no display had a high pitch beep you would hear in the background to tell if you were on mute . mind you i m sure some found it annoying but i would have liked to have the option to have that on .on top of that to get mute you had to hold the button to get it to go on . it was after another feature that i did not use .passive clip the clip on this unit was the type you hook over stuff . cheap and somewhat effective for a belt but sometimes when you have night calls you are not wearing a belt heck you may not be wearing pants . having a clip that can be opened and closed like the ct makes it possible to clip to a bathrobe or other garb more easily . a passive clip needs a more rigid material to hook to .minor issues this unit has a red light on the end of the microphone . it only tells you if the unit is on a dial tone or in use blinking . it would be nice if it indicated mute as well . since it is barely in your line of sight i did not notice it initially . it is more of an indicator to others that you are on a call .on both the ct and this unit the ct the base unit could not be near any other electronics otherwise you would get a strong buzz . easy enough to fix .i was quite pleased how far i could wander around the house though . often i was outside gardening while chatting on the phone . unfortunately this is how the ct got broken . . .
highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of automotive steering suspension work . you will need something like this depending on what access you have to install a balljoint remover .i hate to use the pickle fork . the pickle fork is the last resort for me as it will damage the balljoint boot .i prefer to use the snap on balljoint remover . if that one cannot fit then i will try this tool . if this tool will not fit then i will resort to a pickle fork .i haven t really used it yet for the reason intended changing the oil in my jet ski . so i can t comment on how well it works . the main reason for this review is to put it out there that it does not work with a chevy silverado . the siphon tube does not fit thru the bottom of the dip stick tube . it would be really nice if mityvac had a published list of what vehicles it works with and what ones it does not . i have my fingers crossed that it ll work with my jet ski otherwise there will be a new un used mityvac on slist . long story short do your research to see if you can confirm or deny if it will work with your vehicle before you buy it .there are part numbers out there for this product . . . . i have wheels on my th wheel so i ordered the larger one . . . i tried this out just for fit and i think this will work perfectly to secure wheels when one side is up on leveling blocks and can t be chocked .
they fit fine . works as described lol . comes with the screws and the cotton washers so you dont scratch the body .dunlop capos are functional and inexpensive . come on capos don t have tone . just get one that doesn t get in your way . also the people who work at dunlop seem like nice guys . thank you dunlop for keeping it real up in benicia .it sticks on forever and holds lots of picks . it does exactly what it says it does . its also very cheap .
fit my gallon long wide high just right . the two glass pieces came already inserted into the plastic piece that allows the glass to be lifted for feeding . the other extra plastic piece goes onto the rear glass piece in case you have filters in the back and need to cut slots out for them . however i don t use that plastic piece and have a inch and a half space that fits well for my filter and heater . it also comes with an attachable handle that makes it easier to lift the glass .the specifications state x . x . inches . with the wheels it measures . in height . of course it will not slide into my pantry at that height .now i either place it outside in an unsightly plain view position or drag it in and out of the pantry . i will bet in a few months that the unit breaks after pushing and pulling since the plastic is sort of brittle . the corners of the wheels are flimsy and not engineered well enough for the added stress of daily maneuvering where the wheels attach to the unit .seriously pass this if you are on the bubble of a decision .i love the flight cage the problem is that the parts were so badly protected during shipping . i believe it would be the box the manufacturer packed the product in . there was virtually no protection around any of the pieces in the box . bars were bent panels were bent and a food dish was broken . because the panels were bent it took forever to put the cage together because when you were trying to secure the panels they kept popping out of place . if you put the poor packaging to the side and look at the cage itself it s just an ok buy . the birds love it we have finches and they are flying all over the place . the perches they provide are good . at first i thought they might be too large for the finches but they are using them very easily . a real negitve are the doors . it sounds great when you hear they will shut automatically because they use springs in the doors the problem is if the springs fail the door isnt going to stay shut at all . these doors are located on the two ends of the cage both in the lower and upper part of the cage . this is a big plus you have easy access to the inside of the cage to put food and water dishes in the negitive is you can only reach in so far and then you have to use one on the two doors they have in front which are poorly designed . it uses the type of closer where you run a small bar down the side of the door that goes through little holes to keep the door shut they leave very little left after the last hole and the bar at the top you have to turn and move the rounded bar through a hole . im not discribing it very well but its not convieniant nor do i like how loose it is .in some of the other reviews i saw that people said it was flimsy if you go to any pet store and buy a cage i can tell you this with all the faults this cage has it still is far more sturdy then any ive seen at a pet store . ii do like the shelf under neith it makes it very convieniant to store the supplies for the birds . over time i can see the the pull out drawer that you need to keep clean will most likely not hold up but making referance to another product i buy on amazon i have found gorilla tape works miracles . all in all its not a super buy but it is an ok buy . the birds love it and dollar for dollar i doubt you would be able to find it at a better price and still have the good qualities it does have . i would have given it stars if it werent for how badly it was packed and the issues i do have with the doors .
no worrying about toddlers or even pre schoolers figuring these out . . .very well made and they do their job .to open them you have to depress the top button then pull down towards the floor a bit and out . it takes a few minutes of practice and some finger strength for adults to get it right but there is absolutely no sense in installing the other outlet covers that can be ripped out of the wall then choked on by a baby is there ? i ve also had a few of those other ones snap off inside the outlet which really was a treat . .should not happen with these plugs .so if you want safety these are the plugs to get . been using them for nearly years now and never have my kids come even close to getting them removed . i personally was nearly electrocuted as a child having stuck my parents car keys into a socket . . .trust me it only takes a second for a life threatening incident to happen with your child . why take chances ? ? ?pick up a few extras for grandma s house too .what a simple toy ! at first i couldn t visualize how a baby my first could find a set of stacking cups interesting and enjoyable . well at first all he did was scatter them about . then he started banging things with them . then he started holding them in his hands and walking around with them as if he had hooves . finally he started to study them and spent a lot of time at this activity .at the present time our boy is months old . now he takes the stack apart arranges the cups on a flat place goes back to get them and put them back together in the proper order . i sometimes mix them up on his flat place and turn a few upside down . he immediately goes to the pile and sorts them out in the proper orientation and order and rebuilds the stack . then he smiles at his accomplishment . it s rather amazing .he seems to find the cups endlessly fascinating . when he s whiny or grumpy i give him the stack and that immediately grabs his attention . we take them everywhere . in the bath . in the car . it s a simple and inexpensive delight .gary petersonmy daughter has been playing in this since she was months . most toys don t hold her attention very long but she will play in this for min s at the time ! it has been a real life saver ! my husband is away with the military and i have practicaly been a single mom since she was born . this toy allows me to get household things done . thank you evenflo ! do watch the jester though . . . she has scratched her forehead with it more than once by putting it in her mouth then letting go . . . it even got stuck in her mouth one time lucky i was there to get it out . . . but if you find a toy dangerous on this . . . you can always just take it off ! ! ! i only wish that there were spare toys to order so i could change them out every once in a while when she gets bored with one !
not to large not to small . the drawstring is perfect . i love that i can pull it tightly or actually latch it in place as i need it .i don t have enough room on my patio to use a screw post to attach to so i attached the ends to patio post with eye bolts . then i slipped a short leash handle on the cable so my dog can walk all around the patio .works good because i can work on stuff like the violin i am working on and have her with me . she can walk around my patio .if you are tired of carrying buckets back and forth the fish tank this one is for you . it attaches to your faucet and you can siphon and fill the tank . i use this on the laundry faucet which i needed to buy the additional brass adapter . it allows me to leave one piece connected to the faucet and the other to the plastic connector . then when i need to use it it snaps in place to the faucet and it is easy to remove .
maybe i overlooked the information but you can t use just any regular headset or earphones with this unit . you have to purchase the panasonic kx tca headset . the unit does not come with the optional headset and the two models they did this in the instruction guide are discontinued . i purchased this phone particularly for the hands free feature it will be useful if they pointed out that only a specified headset works with the phone .does what it does and has what it said .works good so far .buy it when you can have compatible staplerswhen you need a phone during an emergency or power outage when you want a phone that is reliably located on the base where someone hasn t walked away with the handset this is the ideal phone ! the phone comes with a longish cord to plug into the phone base and phone jack . if you need the standard short cord to use with a typical wall mounted base there is a slot under the base to wrap the cord instead of providing a shorter second cord . i like this ! it s nice that companies are engineering with cost savings in mind ! the phone comes with pulse and tone dialing needed to use computerized dialing . 
my son used his kid ding fitted mattress cover for over a year . it had gotten kind of gross so i decided to run quickly to the store to pick up a replacement . i made the mistake of not reading the details . this company kid ding makes two different mattress covers that look almost identical if you don t read between the lines ! about the same size one is a kid ding flat mattress cover and the other is a kid ding fitted mattress cover .i wasted my money cause i couldn t return it once i opened it and realized the one i got at the storewaterproof crib toddler bed pad x whitedidn t have a fitted skirt to wrap around the mattress ! i tried to make the best of that one but it was awful ! underneath the crib sheet it slips and slides all over the place and crinkles up like crazy ! what a disaster !i went online to make sure i get the correct one this time and i did ! ! ! this one is a fitted mattress cover by the same company and is just perfect ! wraps around the crib mattress flawlessly and doesn t move an inch ! it stays put and makes slipping on the crib sheet so much easier ! ! ! i have since bought another one ! they re great and reversible . i machine wash mine and air dry do not put it in the dryer !this fits our crib mattress tightly and keeps our baby from sweating against the vinyl of the crib mattress . we didn t have a mattress pad with our son and he would wake up soaking wet from sweating against the vinyl of the crib mattress . the crib sheet alone wasn t enough to keep him from sweating . this pad is also not too bulky so it doesn t cause a safety concern . just make sure the pad fits tightly on your crib mattress for safety s sake . we have a sealy crown jewel mattress and it fits great on it .this mattress pad is waterproof . that is all i need . it goes in the washer and the dryer . not only that it is thick and fluffy like a good quality mattress cover should be to add softness and quality of sleep to a bed . i only need one . it s quite a necessity .
it is wonderful that there are tab dividers in this package and i love the fact that these each have the insert able labels to place each tab dividers .for the money this is an ok deal . however these are light duty type of dividers and may not last as long dividers made out of plastic . these are made out of paper and can tear if you are not careful .for dividing on a short term use or very light use these are ok .if you need to buy something more durable that will last for a long time i cannot recommend these . for me i use a set of clear plastic avery dividers with pockets . and they are a little pricey yet they are of superb quality .face it you are reading a review on tab dividers . i wish i could make this a fantastic piece of literature but that isn t going to happen . these tabs are exactly what they say they are . they are paper dividers with tabs and they work well for what they are . that being said i really feel like they could have upped the thickness of the dividers themselves to they held up a little better . i don t foresee these lasting a long time in a binder you reference regularly because of how thin the material is . for an occasional use these are definitely good .i m not quite sure how to review these dividers . they re what you d expect . they . . . divide . they seem durable the punched holes are reinforced the tabs are a good size to be clearly visible and they come with extra tab inserts in case you can t make up your mind between expenses and outgoing . they will do the job little troopers that they are . it s true they re not flashy or showy but sometimes the homey virtues are the best .
i don t agree with the dimensions listed on amazon s description . it does come with pieces that are about inches long . . .which will cover one side of your crib . however i don t know what the . x part is . i measured the ones i have and the inside of the plastic measures about of an inch . . .and the outside of it is around an inch . the plastic is fairly flexible . i have the aspen in crib and it fits my rails just fine . my month olds have not pulled them off . . . .yet there is another listing for this same product http www .amazon .com prince lionheart crib rail teether dp b jbalrq ref pd sbs ba you might be able to get an idea of the size shape of the crib rail it expects .i covered just one side of their crib at first but this seems to work and i just went out to a local store and bought another pair to cover the other side of the crib .i recommend this product however you need to measure or consider your crib rails they need to be on the skinny side .update after several months of use i noticed that the varnish from my cribs has come off of the crib and stuck to the inside of the teething rails . it is the very very top of the crib rail and not the entire crib rail . i hardly noticed until i looked at it harder . i still like what the product does however i m disappointed that it has ruined the wood . my cribs are cheap anyway but still i take good care of my stuff . i don t know if someone put some furniture polish on the crib rail to make it do that i didn t . i thought this was important and wanted to make sure you know about .this pillow is wonderful . there are a number of ways to manipulate it to support whatever part of you happens to be aching that day . i use it to support my back belly and neck mostly . it can be a bit cumbersome but instead of trying to get out of the pillows grasp i remove the pillow from the bed instead .i am only and there is quite a bit of extra pillow but i just wrap it farther around my body and it s very comfortable !tag reads that it meets california s flame retardant standards but even brand new right out of the package there was no toxic smell .i absolutely love the idea of this crib sheet . after receiving one as a gift i immediately tried putting it in the crib . to my disappointment the elastics at the corners will not fit around the wide posts of my crib . for those of you that have italian made cribs i have a baby italia this sheet may not work for you either . this should come as no suprise since it is also harder to find crib bumpers that fit correctly too . needless to say if you have an italian made crib keep the packaging and the receipt . you may find that you ll have to try another brand .
this cartridge is a good solid filter for use with the marineland or canister filter and polishes the aquarium water well . i alternate between this filter and the filter media canister which acts like a regular filter . the marineland canister filter is great and easy to set up and change out the filters . i bought an extra micron cartridge and media canister to make changes faster and to have an extra micron filter so while i m recharging one i have another to put in the filter . yes ! the micron filter can be regenerated using a chlorine and water solution and reused .i also use a power filter with bio wheels . the result a crystal clear gallon tank with a heavy fish load .great power head . powerful adjustable and when used with quick filter attachment it clears a cloudy tank within hours . when not used with quick filter its hooked to a hydro v sponge filter for better bio filtration !the filter max iii pre filter was a great buy . i use it as a pre filter on my aqueon hob filter . the filter max helps keep the filter clean and allows me to extent the period of time between filter rinses and cartridge changes . this in turn really lets the biological filtration establish itself both in the filter and on the sponge .i like the filter max so much that i have purchased another for my penguin . . .the only challenge with that will be matching the round pre filter to the rectangular intake on the hob filter . . .but i will figure it out !
this fits our crib mattress tightly and keeps our baby from sweating against the vinyl of the crib mattress . we didn t have a mattress pad with our son and he would wake up soaking wet from sweating against the vinyl of the crib mattress . the crib sheet alone wasn t enough to keep him from sweating . this pad is also not too bulky so it doesn t cause a safety concern . just make sure the pad fits tightly on your crib mattress for safety s sake . we have a sealy crown jewel mattress and it fits great on it .the product overall is good . we have a crib that is arched so you have to cut to properly fit to the crib rail .if you have an oeuf sparrow crib these rail protectors are too small . not sure how they would work if they fitted !
the filter max iii pre filter was a great buy . i use it as a pre filter on my aqueon hob filter . the filter max helps keep the filter clean and allows me to extent the period of time between filter rinses and cartridge changes . this in turn really lets the biological filtration establish itself both in the filter and on the sponge .i like the filter max so much that i have purchased another for my penguin . . .the only challenge with that will be matching the round pre filter to the rectangular intake on the hob filter . . .but i will figure it out !i had been using the marineland biowheel filters but decided to try one of these filters after reading rave reviews .i have this filter on a gallon tank always buy more filter capacity than you need . the filter has been in service for more than a year and is still going . here are the pros and cons of this filter vs the biowheel pros comes apart and easy to clean motor is replacable ! inexpensive to maintain if you purchase a nylon bag and box of activated carbon which is a lot cheaper than buying carbon inserts case is transparentcons cleaning all filter media removes all beneficial bacteria otoh the biowheel is never cleaned and hosts beneficial bacteria intake tube is short outer shell may not be breakproofthe case is not plastic if you drop the filter it would probably crack break . the marineland filters are plastic and non breakable .all in all this is a nice filter .this cartridge is a good solid filter for use with the marineland or canister filter and polishes the aquarium water well . i alternate between this filter and the filter media canister which acts like a regular filter . the marineland canister filter is great and easy to set up and change out the filters . i bought an extra micron cartridge and media canister to make changes faster and to have an extra micron filter so while i m recharging one i have another to put in the filter . yes ! the micron filter can be regenerated using a chlorine and water solution and reused .i also use a power filter with bio wheels . the result a crystal clear gallon tank with a heavy fish load .
does not work for all guitars . one of my guitars has a more rounded head and it does not fit over that anyway i have tried . though with the arrow shaped holders it works as it shouldi prefer this design that is fitted to hold the exact size of a diatonic compared to the style that is made to fit any size . great quality lasts forever . you won t be dissapointed .for at great price this strap does all that it is suppose to do . it is very will made has the ernie ball logo on it and works just fine .
it can be an octave divider up to two up or down it can do parallel intervals a la trevor rabin on owner of a lonely heart it can do intelligent harmonies just make sure your guitar is in tune so it can track your playing ! it can do digitech whammy esque divebombs up or down it can do chorus like detuningit can do whammy bar flutter copiesit s a bargainit s very welcome on my pedalboardif it s what you re looking for it s not lexicon it s not tc nor does it profess to be and you know how to use it you really can t go wrong .get one and have fun ! because it s not programmable i m getting another .very sturdy stand made to last a lifetime . easy enough to adjust and can hold a lot of weight . cannot go wrong with this one .wow a bench that really holds my ass . what can i say about it you really need it with the keyboard stand . and it was necessary to the group .
the height of the pan is fine but the length and width of the pan are small .the only time i will use it is when i am washing out the other litter pans to stand in as a place holder .otherwise it is not functional for my full grown cats .great size for someone with a smaller dog and perhaps a smaller stature . i wouldn t recommend this amended size for a tall person .this is a great product ! i bought it for one of my bulldogs . our bulldogs love these toys . they are one of the few toy products that actually stand up to a bulldog ! the only thing i did see wrong is the size . . . and maybe i m just an idiot but i think that you should say size inch not size or or whatever number you associate with its size . you automatically assume that a person knows that the number size label is in inches .
can t say too much about it becuase if your system takes this filter pad sleeve then you have to buy it . and the pad does what it is suppose to do . i was surprise at how the price has gone up in recent years for this item . that is why i recommend washing the pads and reuse them until they begin to fall apart . the best way is to take it outside and use a strong stream of water from a garden hose . the water from the wash can also help your plants grow better .i bought this for my drinkwell . it is a lifetime supply lol . it needs very little rinseing before use which is always a good thing for all you that use carbon for aquarium filters etc . know how some carbon can take for ever to run clear . i will buy some more in years . . .lolthe filters seem to do okay in the petmate waterer however they don t last that long and the cats love to tear them up . i have to replace the filter every days or so with cats . my cats like the waterer but they try to attack the filter through the ramp hole .
just not a fan of big oversized wide body pens . if you have hands like frying pans then this may be your pen . on the plus side i do like the rubber grip and the fact that the pen takes the g ultra fine gel refill . the click action is very smooth and solid .this pilot precise v stick rolling ball pens extra fine point pack red ink . . .by pilot pen corp of america is very nice and just what i needed . . . . well done . .the namiki falcon is one of the great bargains in contemporary fountain pens now that it is has become difficult to find gold nibbed pens under . the falcon has a kt soft gold nib that is semi flex . the barrel is black plastic with goldtone metal accents . it has a nicely finished classic appearance . the pen is . cm long capped . the barrel is mm in diameter in the center of the pen . it has a nice warm feel and would be comfortable in small or moderately large hands . it weighs just under grams with the converter in it . i had wondered if this pen would be too lightweight for my taste but i have come to appreciate it because flexing the nib for long periods of time makes my hand tired . i wouldn t want a heavier pen but if you do the falcon is available in a metal version .the falcon comes in a handsome black box that looks too big for it . the removable tray has space for pens so i am using it to store my most used fountain pens which now include the falcon . the pen comes with a converter and one ink cartridge . namiki pilot converters and cartridges are proprietary . like many japanese pens they have a much larger hole for the ink supply than standard international cartridges . that s good since a flex nib requires good ink flow . but i m not fond of namiki inks so i ve been using the converter which is metal with a plate press on the side . it is easy to clean between ink refills because of the gaping hole in one end . but the nib is difficult to flush with an ear syringe nasal aspirator or soldering bulb . to make it easier you can cut an empty namiki cartridge in half attach it and flush the water through there .of course you are considering the namiki falcon for the nib . it s one of very few flex nibs available on contemporary fountain pens . it s semi flex . it requires a fair amount of pressure to flex to its maximum . if i am writing for a long time it makes my hand tired which a wet noodle might not . but semi flex is an advantage with my small handwriting . if i used a more flexy nib i would have to write unnaturally large . semi flex is perfect for everyday writing and letter writing . i have the fine nib which being japanese is more like a european extra fine . it writes a line about . mm wide unflexed and flexes to mm . the falcon nib does not have an overfeed and it separates partly from the underfeed when flexed but it lays down a lot of ink . it s not for thin paper . i recommend at least g paper .in conclusion some advice on writing with a flex nib don t be disappointed if the falcon nib doesn t flex as much as you would like right out of the box . it took a few days before mine loosened up to its full potential . if you re not accustomed to flex nibs look around online for advice on how to write with them . you apply pressure in the downstrokes and release pressure in other strokes . the nib has a nice bounce and this will become natural with practice . at first attempt it may seem impossible to get the pen to flex when writing cursive if you normally hold your pen in the o clock position . that would be the correct position for normal cursive writing or italic or blackletter calligraphy . but in order to flex on downstrokes you must hold the pen closer to the position . if you want your handwriting to slant to the right turn the paper . i love my falcon .
they do work . exactly as advertised . hane no fear on buying these . fit the chevy silverado wt tailgate rods .it fits fine on my toyota tacoma access cab . i bought this and the stabilizer bar to keep my cooler s from trashing my truck bed .so ez even a cavemen can use it !ok he might have a few cuts while trying ! !fit my nissan frontier s oil pan perfectly . looks to be of nice quality . torque to ft lbs on the frontier anyway 
i don t know how much you can say about picks but this is a versatile pack . you get a multitude of types and there are of each thickness . if you use a variety of picks or are wanting to test out other types of picks this is for you .i always lose my damn picks this helps . hopefully i don t lose this pick holder that would really suck because there is like ten in there !it only holds heavy picks but to be fair there has to be a spring in there so its ok . the tapered design might be to make picks eject easier ? i never owned one of these so have nothing to compare to . except . i did get those wedgie pick holders and those are definitely the way to go for picks on guitars . these are good don t get me wrong .
these discs work well with avent products . they also fit in my lansinoh bottles .these work great for the evenflo bottles . affordable and they fit well so the bottles vent but don t leak . my daughter had no issues with these nipples .this works with our avent bottles . it did leak a tiny bit but what sippy top doesn t . we had trouble using it with ourpura stainless steel bottles . they will fit but with quite a bit of coercion . all other avent sprouts nipples that we used have fit the pura bottles so not sure why these are different .
title says it all . good quality for home or studio use but not sure how it would survive if it were to be taken on tour . still for the price you get a nice adjustable stand that can be manipulated to get basically any mic position you d want from overhead for drums to fret level for guitars above or below vocalists depending on the tone you re hunting etc . versatile and great to work with .this is an ingenious clutch that engages when you step on your hi hat pedal but will drop to the closed position when you hit the lever on the top . this allows you to either ride closed hi hats when using both bass pedals yet return to normal hi hat playing when the music calls for it .be aware that this clutch has only two positions open and fully closed . however there is a way to work around this if you like partially open hi hats in the closed position for a sizzle sound . i did a work around by placing a spring on the hi hat stem with metal and felt washers on the top of the spring which gives me that opening when i drop the cymbal to closed . there was a lot of trial and error finding the right spring because each cymbal pair has a different height when mated together and i was looking for a tiny fraction of an inch opening . too small or low a tension a spring and stickwork chokes the sound . too large or stiff and you will not get the sound . however this is all personal preference and many drummers ride a fully closed hi hat anyway which makes this clutch perfect out of the box .regardless of your hi hat style if you are using a double bass this is a must have accessory . gibraltar s model is solid heavy duty and engages and disengages perfectly every time .this stand easily supports my poundfender frontman r watt x inch guitar combo ampat any height setting . in fact even extended to the highest the this stand supports that amp with no issues from the center of gravity or weight distribution of the amplifier .i love the ease of setting up and breaking down this stand . it is essentially three parts the base and two removable arms . granted that this is heavy but the added weight is there because this thing is built like a tank .in addition to being rock solid the parts mate perfectly with no slop in tolerances . the support arms slide into the base with no friction or excess movement and the height adjustment has three nicely spaced positions . you merely pull back on the spring loaded knobs to release the safety pins that engage the arms for position . once you line up the holes release the knobs and the pins solidly engage and hold the amp in place .my only complaint and it is more of a wish is the tilt of the stand is at a fixed angle . i would love it if i could adjust that too but i am sure that it would drive up the price of the stand . one final note these significantly increase the footprint of an amp on stage . specifically it increases the depth dimension by nearly of my frontman r although the difference in length is nominal . i mention this so you can factor that in if you normally play small venues with cramped stages .overall this is an excellent stand and one that is stable and heavy duty . at the current price at the time of this review it s a bargain .
fits very well on my les paul best tuners you can buy . can t say much else . bought these to replace some gold ones on a les paul clone .this is an original gibson gear replacement part . don t change your knobs or any kind of part in your gibson les paul sg or any other if not for the real deal . i have a les paul and i definetely intend to maintain its value in the long term by using original parts . besides they look great and will perform their job for many many years !
this tape is almost identical to standard scotch packaging tape except that this book tape seems slightly thicker and perhaps easier to reposition . both are clear and glossy and both are available in various widths . standard packaging tape is usually wide this particular product is .if you are looking to repair pages inside a book this will not blend in well as it is too glossy . instead i use scotch magic mending tape for repairing tears in individual pages . the magic mending tape seems to just disappear into the paper . but for torn endpapers just inside the cover i recommend using something like this book tape as you need strength or it just won t hold .our local library sometimes uses this tape to reinforce the outside of paperback bindings but they use a different matte tape for the insides which matches the paper much better .another idea to consider for paperbacks that will see a lot of use you can get book laminating film that will cover the entire book cover . wrap it around the cover edges with appropriate cuts at the corners so it folds neatly inside . i ve had very good results with this method it looks great and protects and reinforces the entire cover and edges .however for simple reinforcement of book splines this product does just fine .i use this double sided removable tape often but only in situations where i do not need strong tape . it is a very useful addition to the arsenal of tape in my home . typical uses tape a birthday card to a wrapped gift . tape an amex gift card inside a holiday card . tape a reminder to the counter . i love the elegant look of double sided tape the tape is not visible at all .i would not use this to stick something on a wall not even a piece of paper . it is not strong enough for that . maybe some day scotch will create a stronger removable tape . i hope so .at first glance this tape doesn t look like it will do the job .i grabbed a book with a detached cover applied the tape and wow !let the repairs begin ! the tape is thick enough to hold the hardbook cover on but flexibale enough to give new life to the book .this tape is very different then slapping typical clear shippingtape on a book which is too thin . with book tape the book isbasicly repaired to like new condition .
these trays are fantastic . no more accidentally dropping a cup of fasteners or kicking one across the garage and then having to hunt for it . just place everything you take off into the tray and it stays put . they are also cheap enough to get a couple different sizes to help organization during a big job .update ok . . . it does leak . i certainly would never call it water proof it is more water resistant so you definitely want to pack things in garbage bags if you want to keep the contents completely dry .we have been considering a roof top cargo bag for several years . it seems like we are running out of room when we travel . our solution had always been to just be more judicious in what we packed but now that we have a baby we began to run out of options . enter the keeper waterproof roof top cargo bag .some general notes this thing holds a lot of stuff . in fact it really is like a second trunk . we were able to fit two big duffle bags into the cargo bag and still have plenty of additional space . now quite proof more like water resistant . the cargo bag only has one zipper which is hidden under a double flap that velcros together . on our trip we only experienced a light snow but everything remained dry . the zipper works pretty well i have noticed in many duffel bags and backpacks that the zipper is the thing that typically fails . so far we have not had a problem with this cargo bag i will update my review if it does fail other things to considerif you are purchasing the keeper roof top cargo bag you may also want to considersherpak supermat roof matfor the protection of your roof . the supermat also provides an anti slip surface and should also help with gas mileage since it works as an additional wind barrier between the cargo bag and your vehicles roof . this thing will wreck havoc on your gas mileage . for us we lost about mpgs and that is with the supermat . not the easiest thing to tie down . the fasteners and straps are mediocre at best so it was a bit of a challenge to get this thing tight to the roof . consider packing during the day the bag and the fasteners are black so without the use of a flashlight it is very difficult attaching this thing at nightone more piece of advice once the cargo bag is loaded make sure you do a test drive at the maximum speed you intend on driving . once you return doube check all of the straps and do a little secondary tightening .final verdict while it was a little difficult fastening to the roof the keeper cargo bag met my expectations . starsforget about those tiny little drip pans that you have to constantly adjust to avoid spilling . this is very large and the integrated spout makes it very easy to transfer the old oil into another container .the only possible negative is that because there isn t a lid i have to store it in a garbage bag to prevent the kids from getting into it .
i ve been thinking about trying the nanoweb strings for a while but i was a bit put off by the high price they cost about twice as much as the uncharted strings i ve been buying and the comments of some reviewers that the tone of coated strings is noticeably duller . i was intrigued by the promise of long life though i have a taylor big baby that i bought used and which came with a set of nanowebs that had probably been on it for a year and they didn t sound at all like old strings . this review set gave me a chance to finally see for myself how they sound when new .i d just changed the strings on my s gibson gospel a week ago so i decided that would be my reference . the nanowebs went on my s guild d . both are well broken in solid spruce top guitars . the gospel is a bit brighter sounding but i m pretty familiar with the sound of both guitars . if they d sounded dull i d notice .as i was unwrapping the nanowebs i noticed that while they were labeled light gauge they had a . e string something you d be more likely to find on a set of medium gauge strings . the b was a . compared to the . of the d addarios i usually play . the rest of the strings were there usual light gauges . turns out that these are hd light gauge designed to have a slightly more tension and better articulation at the high end . the difference shouldn t be enough to require any truss rod adjustment so i went ahead and installed them on the d .so how do they sound ? the unwound e and b don t sound different from any other plain steel string of course . the e does feel a tiny bit stiffer when i switch between the d and the gospel . sound wise i d say they sound like a good set that have been on a guitar for a day . i wouldn t call them dull by any stretch of the imagination . if i didn t know that they were coated strings i certainly wouldn t be able to tell from playing them . so they re good sounding strings and they last a long time . that leaves the question of cost are they worth twice the price of uncoated strings ?here s the way i see it if you re a heavy strummer or playing gigs every night maybe not . you re probably breaking strings or losing them to metal fatigue long before they d go dull from corrosion or contamination . but if you re a finger picker or a light strummer a coated string will probably save you a lot of money in the long run . and if you re a hobby player who keeps a guitar around the house and picks it up once in a while to entertain friends or family coated strings are probably an excellent choice . for myself i m going to leave these on the d for as long as they still sound good . i ll update this review when i find out just how long they do last .follow up after playing these for a few days i actually went out and bought a set in the same gauge for my loar lh an arch top guitar with a carved top that gets played more than any of my other guitars . they sound great on the loar and now i have two guitars to do a long term test on .i still had the original strings on an epiphone lp guitar i bought last november . i know that s bad but buying strings can be complicated and overwhelming . it was nice to get these through vine and try them out .there is a definite difference in the sound of the guitar now that the new strings are on . it sounds cleaner and brighter .i wish i d changed the strings when i first started learning to play because these are much easier to play . now it s not much of an issue but it would have made a difference when i was breaking in my fingers those many months ago .i would definitely buy these again especially because they are so inexpensive .d addario has always been one of the best string manufacturers around . i ve used their strings for electric acoustic bass electric and acoustic guitar irish bazouki mandolin irish tenor banjo string banjo even used their octave mandolin strings on my serbian brach always with stellar results . when they said these were deluxe premium strings i knew it wouldn t be hype . i was right . i strung my guitar with these about weeks ago have probably played the guitar or so hours at gigs and in the studio . i ve never had a set of strings stay in tune over the course of minute sets but these did . and i was sober so it wasn t just an altered consciousness that made me believe they were still in tune . not only that they were still completely in tune the next morning when i played it . of course that wouldn t mean a thing if they didn t feel good on the fingers . they do . like they were custom made for your guitar . they were on my rickenbacker so i can t honestly tell you if they work good with a vibrato but i strongly suspect they would . not only do they stay in tune but weeks later they still sound crisp new . i m going to be interest to see how long they continue to sound good . i usually change my strings every other week when i m playing regularly so i m already passed my regular limit . i may update this review in a month or so when i know how long they lasted . most highly recommended !
this inch airstone is perfect for my gallon aquarium !works great but is on the small side as in not a large diameter gauge would be easier to read if it was bigger .hard to mess up a floating square . it does contain the food .negatives . . . .to me at least the post that attaches it to the side is long . this puts it far from the corner .overall size float size is l x w . pretty large .inside float dimensions are approx . l x w .this ring could be reduced by a third or half . the foam material does support algae and is quite visible unless you keep the water level up to the black trim .i m used to a simple x clear plastic ring with trapped air floats . this type stays in the corner with the surface tension of the water .all in all i ll use it but wouldn t buy another due to the size .
this pail is not only good for disposable diapers but cloth diapers as well ! it s great that it doesn t require any special type of bag . you can put in a regular trash bag if you want or you can buy their refill bags . i use it with a pail liner for my cloth diapers .it does a great job of keeping the smells in . the only time i notice a smell is when i m opening it up to throw in a diaper or to change the pail liner .i like this product so much that i recommend it to anyone i know who s having a baby whether they are using disposables or cloth diapers !these cloth diapers are reasonably priced and include a padded middle . they should do the trick for those using cloth diapers . they also work as burp cloths for those using disposable diapers .stay away from the other brands that require special refill bags . what a waste of money ! even the new and improved diaper genie can t compare to the diaper champ .the diaper champ uses regular size trash bags where the diaper genie requires special refills . i can t imagine why anyone would want to constantly buy expensive refills for a diaper pail when a simple trash bag is all you need .as for the smell issue . let s face it diapers stink . and regardless of brand any diaper pail will need to be emptied on a regular basis . i really think some people don t realize this . when i first had my son i bought a diaper champ to keep at my mom s house . when my mom used to change him she d dispose of the diaper in the diaper champ but didn t change the pail . after about a week she complained because it started to stink . i had to explain to her that it wasn t a magic pail it was still just a covered trash bin . honestly how did she raise kids ? . . . now mom s back on track and loving her diaper champ .as far as the odor issue goes i have seen no difference in odor control between the diaper genie vs the diaper champ both work pretty well to contain and control odor better than a regular trash barrel but neither are odor proof .
low price can get one for each of my vehicles . . .the stock wrench that came with the cars are too short . . . .when you need it it will be worth it .when looking at these products simply calculate the actual cost per square foot . for example this speaker kit contains . square feet for around bucks price fluxuates like its a stock or something ? can u think of anything thats worth dollars a square foot ? there are so many cheaper alternatives . dynamat is an awsome product and it does work . but for those of us not made of money search this butyl flashing tape u will be glad u did .aligator clips make the battery tender much more versatile .not many batteries are able to accomodate the pin plug this is quite dissapointing when it arrives and it is not ready to use w o clips .actually battery tender should include or at least make the buyer aware that these clips are most often a must .it would be advisable for them to include this assembly even if the price goes up dollars it is well worth getting the full compliment of accessories to get a completely functional unit . saves time and shipping .amazon does list these as a most often purchased with accessory but it is quite essential most people are unaware of this .on the plus side it is a a great product once you can use it !
when to use epoxy cementwhen you need a strong rigid workable e .g . sandable and or paintable surface adhesive particularly for use on metal or hard plastic epoxy is usually the best choice . most epoxies dry with little running or shrinkage and so are good for filling gaps . the major drawback to epoxies is that they consist of two parts resin and hardener which must be mixed in small batches and then applied with your own applicator e .g . a toothpick or popsicle stick . some are packaged in a dual syringe but that is not an adequate solution because the components must still be manually mixed in order harden to maximum strength .when to use jb weldjb weld is a very strong epoxy cement . jb weld is the cement glue of choice when joining metal parts or filling holes in metals . otherwise ordinary epoxy cement or other types of cements glues are usually better choices . some other reviewers have complained that the descriptive name weld is inappropriate to some extent that s true . jb weld can do some jobs welding can t . conversely some simple welding jobs like joining two thin metal rods at right angles are difficult with jb weld .how to use jb weldgeneral principles although jb weld makes an excellent filler and can even be used to cast small parts it is not remotely as strong as real metal used this way . whenever possible use jb weld as an adhesive a very thin layer of jb weld holding two pieces of metal together . always reinforce with metal pieces when possible . for example rather than building up a massive flange with jb weld you might be able to use scrap peice of metal to form most of the flange held in place with jb weld . the greater the relative surface area of contact the strong the bond will be .surface preparation as with any adhesive the surface must be clean and rough . clean with a solvent according to another reviewer acetone is the best solvent for this purpose but rubbing alcohol will work roughen the surface then clean with the solvent again . use a clean cloth for each application of solvent . i generally use a small grinding wheel in a dremel tool to roughen the surfaces . you can also scratch the surface with a knife or use coarse sandpaper or both depending on the material .the solvent cleaning is for removing the last traces of oil from clean surfaces . if the parts are oily even multiple cleanings with solvent may not be enough you may redeposit oil from your cleaning cloth or as the solvent evaporates on the surface . so if you can detect any oil on any portion of the part or if you have any doubt clean it with a degreaser first . if you do not have a commercial degreaser handy a paste of laundry detergent and a stiff brush may do the trick . only when you are certain that there are no traces of oil is it time for the solvent cleaning s .joining broken parts if you are joining broken parts with a clean but irregular matching surfaces limit the roughening to scratching with a wire brush or etching with an acid but be sure to wash off all traces of the acid . apply a thin uniform layer of jb weld lightly clamp together hard enough to squeeze out any excess . sometimes a thick rubber band is perfect . often you can arrange pieces so that the weight of the top piece will hold the joint together until the jb weld cures . sometimes you can place a weight such as a brick on top to apply gentle pressure . do not remove the clamp or pressure until the jb weld has cured completely . after an hour or two after the glue has set but is still soft you can cut off any excess with a knife or razor but if you don t need to cut the excess off don t . often you can build up the surfaces around a break for added strength . sometimes blue painters tape can be used to help hold pieces together while the glue sets and or to make a temporary stand to hold the pieces in the best orientation .scotchblue painter s tape for multi surfaces . a inches by yards rolljoining dissimilar parts minimize any gaps if possible e .g . by sanding if possible so that the contact as perfect as possible . if you will be filling substantial gaps sometimes it is helpful to cover openings with blue painters tape to prevent the jb weld from flowing away and leaving gaps .joining long thin parts rods or sheets try to overlap if possible or reinforce them with a similar overlapping peice of metal glued in place with jb weld . to join a steel rod to another steel rod forming a t a common and easy welding job almost impossible with just jb weld cut two long l s from a heavy paper clip or make l s from similar wire and embed those with jb weld on opposite sides of the joint . you can further strenthen the joint by wrapping fine steel wire around the rods holding the l s in place before covering it all with jb weld . be sure to thoroughly clean the rods and wires first see below . for small parts or when wire wouldn t work well unwaxed dental floss is remarkably strong and can do an excellent job of reinforcing joints when embeded in jb weld . ideally apply the jb weld then wind the floss tightly into the soft jb weld .filling holes don t forget to prepare the surfaces as described above even if you can only roughen the surfaces with an ice pick or awl . jb weld shrinks very little as it cures so fill the hole completely . if it is possible to sand the surface when the jb weld has hardened then overfill the hole slightly . since jb weld flows a little until it sets the surface should be horizontal . if not horizontal you can apply the jb weld and then cover the hole with blue painters tape until the jb weld sets . depending on the job it is often a better strategy to fill the gap as much as possible with a piece or pieces of metal embedded in jb weld that a single mass of pure jb weld .reinforcing a leaking pipe work jb weld into a piece of fiberglass cloth or with a spatula apply and then add more jb weld to any thin spots and to feather out the edges . you may have to apply several layers of the jb weld saturated fiberglass cloth . sometimes wire cloth window screening can be used .holes in car body panels etc if you can cover at least one side of the hole with a piece of sheet metal held in place by jb weld that is a good strategy the combination of pop rivets and jb weld often works especially well even if you ultimately sand the heads of the pop rivets away .tekton rivet gun with pc . rivetsmixing follow the instructions . a paper plate can be a good mixing surface popsicle sticks are the best mixing tools . beware that you must use the same amount of resin and hardener and they must be very thoroughly mixed . mix until you are certain that it is completely and thoroughly mixed and then continue mixing for twice that time . seriously ! ! !curing follow the instructions but wait longer than recommended the longer you wait the stronger the bond . a a day or two at or degrees is a reasonable minimum . note that epoxies do not dry there are no solvents to evaporate instead a chemical reaction hardens the cement a plastic resin . chemical reactions are proportional to temperature the rule of thumb is that for each degrees the reaction speed doubles . using the rule of thumb if it takes day to cure at degrees then it takes days to cure at degrees and that s only to minimally cured . okay i know that waiting this long is not practical in many circumstances you can probably get away with curing for hours at degrees but don t go much higher than degrees and take it easy for a couple of days .when to use other epoxiesfor materials other than metal particularly for rigid plastics other epoxies are usually better than jb weld . some epoxies are clear or white or specialized for particular purposes . for exampleclearbond h s clear strong epoxy adhesive syringe . ozwhen to use quick epoxiesordinary slow epoxies whether jb weld or other epoxies dry harder than quick epoxies and are generally the best choice . maximum strength is the whole point of epoxies if you don t need maximum strength you probably do not need epoxy . use quick epoxies when the hardening speed is essential when the item cannot be supported in the required orientation while the epoxy sets at least several hours or when you have to absolutely minimize flowage . super glue is often a good alternative in such situations .when to use other cements or glueswhile epoxies are ideal for a few specific uses primarily when you need a rigid cement for metal or rigid plastic there are many situations when other types of glue are better choices . epoxies are generally not recommended for flexible surfaces such as leather wood or flexible plastic and generally do not adhere well to glass etc . while epoxies may work with porous surfaces paper wood ceramics etc . other adhesives are usually better .white glue for most light duty indoor household applications which do not have to be waterproof ordinary household white glue is safe cleanup is very easy and in most cases repairs are redo able if you make a mistake . white glue shrinks a great deal as it dries and so is not good for filling holes or large gaps . for example elmer s all multipurpose white glue oz . e glue stick think of glue sticks as thick white household glue in stick form . glue sticks are great with paper but have few other applications .avery glue stic . oz pack of wood glue carpenters s wood glue is essentially water proof when dry white household glue . it penetrates and strengthens the wood better than any other type of glue . it is safe and cleanup is easy . if the joint breaks again because the wood is weak it can be re glued . for example elmer s e carpenter s wood glue ouncegoop goop will bond virtually any material including leather plastics glass and metal . the bond is clear very strong waterproof and hard but flexible . since goop is clear if a little extra oozes out it is barely noticeable . i ve used goop to repair ceramic plant pots water hoses and shoes to seal holes in air mattresses to close small holes in window screens as plumbers paste in assembling plumbing parts to i also use it to seal rust spots on my dishwasher rack the goop it also makes a cushioned surface that will prevent scratches to dishes . goop is particular good for repairing damaged electrical cords .amazing goop all purpose household goop . ounce tube silicon glue silicon glue is best for glass and when you want a truly flexible connection for example to absorb vibrations . it is a good alternative for goop for general household use on glass plastic and metal when you do not need the maximum possible strength . it is safer than goop and cleanup is easier . like goop silicon glue takes days to reach reasonable strength weeks to reach maximum strength . for example ge silicone ii household glue . ozfabric glue beacon fabri tac permanent adhesive ounceworks amazingly well on fabrics saturating the surfaces enough to provide a very strong bond but without soaking through . depending on the application fabric glue can be better than sewing . it remains very flexible e .g . it would probably be great on leather or heavy vinyl e .g . women s handbags shoes luggage etc . super glue krazy glue super glue is very strong rigid and fast . in many ways it is similar to minute epoxy except that no mixing is required . although very hard super glue is brittle and so is not recommended for flexible objects . super glue is hazardous in that it can easily glue fingers etc . together . previously i used super glue frequently on objects e .g . jewelry when a clear bond was required however goop is better for such applications safer and more conveneient . opened super glue keeps poorly even in tighly sealed glass containers so i recommended packages of multiple very small tubes .bazic super glue grams . ounces per packliquid nails construction adhesive when you need to permanently join a large amount of surface of almost any kind construction adhesive is usually ideal . if you need to join x s to make a x construction adhesive is better than nails . most construction adhesives are slightly flexible and so can even be used on leather i .e . to repair a loose shoe sole etc . construction adhesive may leave a stain on porous surfaces and may stain through thin surfaces . for small projects goop is usually a better choice .caulking compound you can think of caulking compound as white household glue with alot of inert filler to use when you need to fill holes . as an adhesive it is the weakest on this list but is strong enough for many purposes when spread over a large surface such as the back of a ceramic tile . a few years ago i made a brick column to support a mailbox . traditionally i should have used mortar which would have been very time consuming . i could have used construction adhesive albeit any excess that squeezed out would have been ugly but caulking compound was quick cheap looks good and was more than adequate for the job .i ve been a regular user of permatex silicone spray for over ten years . i use the spray mostly as preservative for rubber plastics and other synthetic materials and as a lubricant for things like lock mechanisms zippers screws and joints . i apply it to the rubber hoses and sealing strips in my car my bicycle tires running shoes nylon cases and luggage and even camera gear . silicone is also a good electrical conductor . after cleaning electrical contacts i apply a little spray which seems to improve performance and deters corrosion .unlike crc s silicone spray which can react with and deface and damage certain plastics permatex s silicone spray has never damaged anything that i have used it on . the spray comes with a tiny plastic tube that you can insert into the spray nozzle so that the spray can be concentrated and applied in a confined area like the key slot in a lock . the only real gripe i have is that the product has a tendency to foams up when sprayed and this is exacerbated when the tube is attached . the resulting spray is usually really messy and hard to apply evenly . other than this i have no major complaints about the product which has apparently been in production for over years .silicone spray is flammable but not exceedingly so . still care should be exercised in its use and adequate ventilation should be provided . the permatex spray can holds . ounces which is more than thecrc crc product . the permatex spray costs about . at my local store so you might want to check around for the best price .these are fairly solid lead cables . the cables themselves are are separate so they are an actual set or pair where others i have worked with were still connected along the length of the main lead each lead cable is about the thickness of a cheap usb cable .the banana clips are normal common the metal end is completely attached to the plastic part i have had some where they come apart of pulled to hard these are solid . additionally the connection into the lead wire is very solid and non removable i think it will hold up very well and not break lose .the alligator clip ends seem to be just fine . contrary to others results i have pairs and the alligator ends are just fine teeth all line up fine . the rubber insulator is actually fairly tight which is nice because it makes the clip easier to open and close . clips that have loose movable rubber insulator can actually be clumsy to open cause the rubber slips and slides under yours fingersoverall really wish they were combined leads not separate wires and thicker gaugegood cables and i would still recommend them if this review helped you please click the button below

i have installed a transmission cooler in my fj cruiser and use this scan tool gauge to monitor the transmission temperatures in the pan and at the converter control valve sensor . having the rig set up for towing this product is a very valuable asset plus you can watch various other parameters and sensor reading mpg s etc etc and use it also as a scan tool . . .excellent product !perfect fit for rear window on my ford excursion limited . easy to install . no spotting seen or squeaking at allit works and the support staff at linear logic are helpful if you have any issues . my local shop suspected that i have a bad o sensor that wasn t being flagged by the on board computer . with the scangauge i programmed in codes for fuel trim o sensors and air fuel ratio and can see that it all looks ok . saved in diagnosis charges and i can monitor the readings as i drive .

i use this heating pad for the feral cats houses . it kept them very warm in cold new york winterswe use this heat lamp to keep our african hedgehog warm in the winter . i like this type because there is no light emitted just heat . i nice smooth heat that will help keep her alive . we have been using it on a temperature control switch for a few months this season and i expect it to last the entire winter .i bought these heating disks for the stray cat s outside . they are wonderful we heat them at night and during the harsh winter day s and they keep those poor animals outside warm .
it s aquarium airline and it works . nothing else to say really it s one of those simple products that does exactly what it is designed to do .the product works well with my litter box but it doesn t match the color at all . it does it s job but it s definitely not tan !what can i say its tubing and its blue . plenty of tube do the job and works fine . no complaints here
fits very well on my les paul as a lot of epiphone owners have learned cases designed for the gibson es clones won t fit epiphone guitars as the epiphones have a slightly larger headstock . this case however fits my dot custom like a glove . the padding is perfect the top is arched to precisely fit the guitar and the build quality is better than you might expect at this price level .at first it look small for my guitar but it fits perfectly with my epiphone lp les paul electric guitar
these locks are awesome . we slid them into the folding spots on my preschooler s closet doors . the photo is misleading and makes it look like they lock in the middle between the doors but they actually slide into place where the doors fold so make sure to order two .used this lock for the sliding doors on our entertainment center . works great . we used it horizontally unlike the suggested vertical method .this gate has been great for the doorway to a room that we are in and out of constantly . i initially purchased thesummer infant sure and secure extra tall walk thru gate white but i had trouble with the latch staying closed not something you want with an ambitious baby around ! sure it is more difficult to step over this gate but it will never come unlocked to allow a child to break loose . it is easy to take down anytime you need with one hand easy to carry around and the plastic does not mar the door frame or paint on the wall i lean it against for storage when not in use . the gate can be left on the door frame when the door is closed .for us the summer infant door will not close with the gate up lever handle not a knob on the door so for naptime and bedtime the gate had to be taken off . this involves unscrewing all four pressure mount posts using two hands to carry the gate one on the door part one on the frame and finding a place to put it where the metal would not damage walls or furniture . i think it would be more appropriate for a place where removal was not often necessary . and the noise ! a baby grabbing the bars and shaking can make quite a racket !
i was pleasantly surprised at how well this little mixer performs . it was exactly what i needed to record myself singing karaoke on the computer . for the price it does a very good job . i don t detect any hum at all and i only get hiss when i crank the volume up too high . i recommend this mixer for your home studio . it works perfectly with my sound card . you do not need usb to get this to work .this unit is compact enough to take with you if you need a small interface to take along with your laptop for field recording . it is powered via the usb bus so you don t have to carry power supplies or worry about finding an outlet for the device .one issue is that this is not a plug and play device . you will need to install a device driver in order for your computer to recognize it . after the driver was installed i was able to get pro tools to recognize it right away without any issue . i recorded some tracks just to see how easy it was to work with and how it sounded . it works like any other interface in pro tools so you will be able to use it easily enough . the mic pre amps don t seem terribly powerful and you will have to really up the input level to get anything out of a v condenser microphone like the ones i use to record vocals and guitars . i found that the overall sound quality was okay but just okay . i wouldn t want to use this for anything important but it will work fine if you are doing a field recording of rehearsals or doing pre production in a practice space . i wouldn t recommend it for serious studio work though and i would rather drag my pro tools i o rack to a location if i was in the field .the build quality is a bit suspect on this as well . i noticed that the unit made a clinking noise when i picked it up after taking it out of the box . it seems that the bottom panel is not secure and is a bit loose . i can move the top and bottom together and apart making a clinking sound . this can of course be taken care of very easily but i would rather have a device come as it should . i have never had a problem with a tascam unit before and i have had a ton over the years so i hope this is just a one off quality control issue . the knobs feel okay but there is a bit of play in the line out control and one of the attenuators is sticky .bottom line starsrecommended for casual use but not for commercial usea looper pedal has been on my list of things i d like to get some day for a long long time . why i waited so long to get one i can t say . all i can say is how glad i am not only that i finally got one but that i got this one . it is fantastic . here s why .first ease of use . i really thought i d be slowly working my way through a long manual then slowly figuring out how to use the pedal . on the contrary i got this out of the box plugged it in and was recording my first loops in a matter of minutes . the instructions a brief clear and walk you through the steps . this manual wins on brevity and clarity in the great manual wars . as i delved deeper into the options i was able to quickly figure out how to do everything i wanted to do .second user interface . it s a pedal . it s got knobs and buttons . this makes me very happy . it s well laid out and easy to get to all the settings . once you ve got it up and running i strongly recommend setting it up so you can set a rhythm on a new loop by tapping the pedal . the work flow with this thing is just very logical and simple .third features . it has built in drum beats that are simple but sound better than just a metronome and help you get in the mood to jam out your loops . the beat is like a guide track not recorded into the loop .fourth plays nice with computers . there s a usb port and you can connect this to the computer with a standard cable not included and copy your loops to the free downloadable loop library software . there you can make some basic adjustments to them and organize them .fifth comes with an ac adapter . it actually has to since it does not run on batteries but still i was happy to see it in the box .sixth you can add an sd card not included to expand the memory substantially .all of which gives you some specifics but misses the overall experience . the experience for me has been pure jamming joy . i hear a song in my head and very quickly have the basic concept captured as a loop . you can plug your electric guitar or a mic into the input so you can capture anything you want .for the price this is a wonderful piece of gear and my only regret is not having bought one sooner . i m having so much fun with it .
when i made a larger pedal board from plywood to accommodate a new pedal tuner i could not pull the power grip tape from the old board to reuse it ! the adhesive is extremely strong and the unique locking surface is almost as strong . works great .i ve been using a standard size pedaltrain for years and was tired of the adhesive on the pedal side of the velcro strips inevitably coming loose after being moved around a bit . i use it to keep pedals in place a line m a seymour duncan twin tube classic and a live wire a b switch . the first two are pretty heavy and bulky . i needed something substantial to keep them in their spots especially during transport in the case being carried vertically with other electronics and a bunch of cables on top of them .i decided to try out the power grip and have been extremely impressed . first i stripped the old velcro stuff off of the pedals and board and cleaned the surfaces thouroughly . it all came off pretty easily . i then applied one strip of power grip to each of the bottom panels on the pedaltrain and individual pieces to the bottom of the pedals . i then let everything sit for hours as recommended .after attaching the pedals i was amazed at how well everything was secured . the pedals are only being held by the one strip on the higher panel the other strip is just padding under the bottom sides of the pedals to prevent metal on metal abrasion . however you can confidently hold the whole thing vertically and shake it aggressively without anything going anywhere .i also appreciate that you can pull pedals off of the board to move them around with some effort and the grip will release without the adhesive budging even a bit .the grip also bonds to itself unlike velcro where you re keeping track of male and female tape when replacing it .i would recommend following the manufacturer s instructions and applying this stuff to clean hard non porous surfaces . i ve heard that the adhesive doesn t work on rubber wood etc . many pedals have rubber padding feet on the bottom but i ve had no trouble prying that stuff right off before putting the tape on .you will appreciate the stability security and convenience this stuff provides . get a few rolls as a meter doesn t go as far as you d think .my issue with the pedaltrain is the accommodation of a power supply . i have a voodoo lab pedal power plus .the documentation that comes with this pedalboard specifically states that this power supply mounts under the board and it even includes mounting brackets that fit this power supply . however if you actually try to mount it to the underside of the board as suggested you re in for an unpleasant surprise .first of all regarding the two circular holes on the front of the board . the fitment to the power supply is there . . . sort of . there s no way to align them perfectly because the holes on the pedaltrain are slightly too close together . i wasn t worried about this since i doubt i ll ever chain them and only have access to outlet .the second issue is the allegedly self tapping screws that come with the mounting kit strip as though they were made of butter . once you ve got them in or attempted to do so they re never coming out . you ll probably have to break them . it s a shame to have cut corners on something so inexpensive .the main issue i have with this board relating to my voodoo lab power supply is this . once you get the power supply mounted properly on the underside of the board it can only go one place you begin to plug in your pedals and you discover that the cables supplied with the power supply don t fit the mounting location on this board . you can t plug them in because there s not enough clearance between the frame of the pedalboard and the sockets the cables plug in to .i really only bought this pedalboard because of the supposed perfect compatibility with the voodoo lab power supply i own but given that it doesn t fit like it s supposed to i wish i could return this board except i can t because it now has holes drilled in it . you have to drill the board to mount the power supply underneath it . basically i paid for a plain flat sheet metal metal rectangle and a couple rolls of velcro . needless to say i m not very pleased .
not much i can say about a standard mic stand . unless it was a cheap piece of crap . this one is not . nice heavy base plate . here is my only complaint i went to remove the upc sticker on the shaft and now i have a mess . i ll try some wd to get the annoying residue off but for crying out loud can t anyone come up with a sticker that is removable without a headache ? and as an end user a upc sticker serves nobody . why is it even there ? put it on the box it comes in but get it off of the merchandise i m buying !i bought this for my new string guild acoustic . i use oasis humidifier for my other acoustics and am satisfied with them . the reason i tried this one is because it s necessary to spread the strings quite a bit to get the tube in between them . and with strings it really put a lot of tension on them . another difference is there is nothing to do with the planet waves . you slip the included packs into the saddlebag type pouch and slide them between the strings . they should last months you don t do anything else . also comes with a rd one for the headstock . with others you have to add water and remeber to check it so they don t dry out . i also used a dampit but because it hangs from a cord it sometimes gets caught on the wiring on an acoustic electric ! i may eventually replace my oasis humidifiers with these also .i thought i would throw my two cents in about the new design and effectiveness of this soundhole humidifier .after making a few homemade case humidifiers out of things like a travel butter container with many holes drilled into it and a sponge i started thinking about how some of the cases separate the body cavity from the neck headstock cavity inside the guitar case and not allowing the humidity to flow freely to all areas especially the body where it is needed the most .even though i was getting acceptable humidification in the case i was concerned about the body being dryer in comparison so i went ahead and splurged the bucks on these . i actually bought three of them . i crank the gas heat up in the house in the winter and a c in the summer keep my guitars inside their cases and inside a closet . the humidity drops quite low but the sponges remain moist for several days before i can no longer fight the urge to re wet them . lol .two great tips in one use a regular more dense sponge thicker like the ones at the dollar store . cut them to size and stuff them in !throw away the sponge when it starts to get yucky and don t worry about distilled water unless you want to . i can t argue using very pure water compared to the possibly toxic crap that comes out our faucets but for one dollar you can get a boat load of them after you cut them to size and toss them away without any regard when needing replaced .don t worry about the thing hanging in between your strings . it will not damage anything unless you get the sponge too saturated and it leaks . i will either squeeze the excess water out or shake the container with the sponge inside until i am satisfied that it won t drip .the humidifier will not cause any stress or damage to your strings by spreading them when you wedge this inside your soundhole .if you are rough careless thoughtless or stupid you could possibly knock this loose and have it rub or fall out but i would be more worried about the guitar and what it would take for this to happen . this would be more extreme to the guitar than the humidifier or any harm it could cause .the top snaps on by squeezing the sides to release little tabs that stick through the top cover . the sponge inside is quite small and there isn t too much room for a much larger sponge . the device is simple and fairly solid . treat it gently and it will last forever . you can easily clean the inside or run it through a dishwasher . if you give the inside a quick rinse every few fills i m sure it would be a decade before anything built up to require extensive cleaning or replacement .keep an eye on it for the first few days and then weeks to get a feel for when you should be re wetting the sponge .try to keep the sponge moist when it s dry .i strongly suggest getting an oasis case humidifier or similar mini sized about x costing around bucks .this will take any guesswork out of the equation and give you fairly accurate readings inside your guitar or instrument case .remember too much humidity can cause your acoustic guitar to warp . too dry and it will shrink and crack split the soundboard top also leaving the edges of the frets sticking out like the backbone of a fish and quite abrasive !if you spent more than one hundred dollars on your guitar and live where it gets cold and or dry you would be negligent if not careless to spend the pittance to make sure your baby ain t thirsty or worse . . .dead broken !hope this helps !
this little geegaw is a stable tripod stand to hold the neck of your guitar while you restring it or perform other work . it folds into a nice small package you can store in the gear compartment of most cases . the rubber pads on the neck end prevent scratches and the feet keep it in place on the table . it may be best to invest in a non slip pad to place under the heel of the guitar body for protection and to prevent it from slipping around as movement can topple the stand if you re not careful . sure a suitably sized cardboard box or stack of books will also serve that purpose but what else would you spend the on ?while this hanger is not unattractive and is well built i could and will modify it to better suit my needs . the design of the hanger causes the neck of the uke to stand off of the wall inches at the head and inches at the hanger itself and inches at the base of the body . this is not an easy fix but it is doable .this is a well made table top stand . the weight of the stand holds the mic and wire in place with ease . i would get this stand again .
i have two of these installed on sliding cabinet doors . the doors are wood with a glossy melamine coating and the locks have stayed securely stuck for over a year . they are simple for an adult to use use thumb and finger to push both tabs down at the same time then slide door open . as long as there is or so of clearance between the doors they will slide freely with the lock compressed between them . upon closing the doors the lock s wings snap out again and the doors are automatically locked easy ! our son now months has not put great effort in trying to defeat the lock but i think it would be physically very difficult for a child his age to do so . he could easily apply the pressure necessary to press the wing down but to maintain that pressure on both wings while simultaneously opening the door is a tall order for a toddler .on the flip side while investigating the lock one day he pulled down hard on the top wing and it snapped right off . he went right over to our other cabinet and snapped the top wing off the lock on that one . he hasn t yet tried to break off the bottom wings and i believe that would be more difficult to do but i docked this product a star for the easily broken plastic . it was fully effective until age months i haven t found any alternatives that are as convenient as this and for the time being it remains effective even with one broken wing so it still gets four stars .these locks are awesome . we slid them into the folding spots on my preschooler s closet doors . the photo is misleading and makes it look like they lock in the middle between the doors but they actually slide into place where the doors fold so make sure to order two .as with everything about being a parent locks are more complicated than you d have thought or would like ! screw mounted magnetic locks the safety st tot lok locks can be difficult to install especially on drawers but have more flexibility about where you can install the lock than the adhesive locks and seem very secure . still most people may want to try the adhesive locks see below first to make it easier to get some child proofing done quickly .pros very nice secure once installed especially since the fit can be adjusted to give a tight lock when closed . works vertically or horizontally . . . that is on the side of a door or the top . can easily be switched to hold the lock open for when no children are aroundcons complicated to install especially in some situations . so you might not get around to installing them given all the other demands on your time . requires drilling a hole partway through the cabinet door from the inside for the magnetic part plus some small holes to attach may require some new tools a collar lock to keep from drilling through the door and a right angle chuck for tight spacesif you plan to be in your home for a while and want a finished secure set of locks the tot loks may be a good choice .one note if you use them often the magnetic key will wear the finish where it rubs .adhesive mount magnetic locks the kidco adhesive mount magnet locks will only work in some spots but it s still a good lock to try first for a lot of people because it works well in the right situations and is easy to install . buy some and see how they work on your cabinets . once you ve tried a few it s a lot easier to see where ll they ll work or won t work .pros quick to install after a few minutes of figuring it out no drilling required so less work and no damage to furniture or cabinetscons only installs horizontally along the top edge of a door or drawer given the way they use gravity to lock .we just use the adhesive mount no additional screws for some furniture we didn t want to drill holes into . they seem to be strong enough so far especially since our kids seem to give up trying a door after a while if it won t open they lose interest . i don t know how the adhesive would stand up to long term use or really heavy pulling .hook locks the advantage that either of the magnetic locks has over the old fashioned hook type like themommy s helper safe lok cabinet door and drawer lock is that the hooks have a lot more play they have to open a little bit to give you access to the lock . so a child can bang them back and forth they might not open the door or drawer but they will make a racket . maybe ok in some situations but not a great solution for easily accessible drawers or doors .slide locks slide locks such as theamerican red cross cabinet safety slide lock are very quick and easy to install if they fit . but they can also be pretty easy for some kids to unlock so if they are within reach they aren t much of a barrier to older kids . and even younger kids can sometimes open them by pulling or pushing on the doors . however they are a good temporary solution and can be useful to carry when you travel .flex locks flex locks like the safety first cabinet flex lock see reviews orcabinet flex lock pack are strong and easy to install and you can see by looking at them whether the lock is secure unlike the magnetic locks which are designed to be out of sight . so you might want to use them for critical spots such as under the sink or use them when you travel . and as a bonus they are so secure that even some adults can t open them ! they do take two hands to open . not attractive but they do the job if you keep them tightened .
they re so useful for our purposes beer brewing ! this size is sturdy and just right for storing bottled beer and shelving it so it can age . i also love that they re very easy to store before you need them nice and flat and fit into small spaces when stored upright until needed .tops fit nicely and are sturdy enough for stacking too .i live in an apartment so it doesn t make sense for me to have an entire filing cabinet for documents and papers that need to be properly organized and stored . this fills that void perfectly without taking up much space . i keep it in the bottom of my closet and it takes up little to no space among the shoe racks .it easily fits a large amount of letter size papers and while your smaller pieces id cards etc . may get lost in the bottom you are able to locate it fairly easily as each compartment reaches all the way to the bottom .the top is a bit wobbly and flimsy . i can see that being a concern if you were to keep it in places where water may be an issue but i am dry in my closet .all in all this is perfect for getting your stuff organized in limited space .if the thought crosses your mind that you need a foot rest then i would certainly recommend this model . its a pretty wide inches base that gives your feet plenty of room to rest and move around or have your feet apart comfortably . its fairly heavy so you know the steel can handle some weight . there is no assembly you just pull it out of the box and place it on the floor . if you have sleek floors it has rubber feet in the corners to prevent it from sliding around . the top area is covered with a comfortable yet slightly gritty pattern that is good for shoes or bare feet .once on the floor it is easily adjustable with your feet just by pushing up or down . once there it stays snug without feeling loose . you can adjust the tightness of the foot rest with the two nuts on the inside .while simple in design its perfectly functional and a solid piece of furniture that will outlast most furniture .
it smells good . the ingredient list is impressive as is the nutritional analysis .my dogs dachshunds a chihuahua and french bulldog love redbarn beef dog food roll . and i love feeding it to them and here s why it is made in the usa and contains no corn or soy . the lamb and rice flavor is wheat free as well . dogs can have or develop allergies to corn soy or wheat . it is cooked in the casing for less nutrient loss and specially prepared and packaged without oxygen so that it will remain fresh at room temperature without the use of artificial preservatives such as bha bht or ethoxyquin . it is digestible which means less dog poo and fewer cleanups . it is a complete and balanced meal but it can also serve as a protein supplement when mixed with dry food . when cut in cubes they make wonderful treats and training aids yes dogs find them that yummy . in a pinch when i am out of greenies pill pockets a cubed piece can even be used to hide pet medications .once you have sliced open the roll you must seal and refrigerate the unused portion . i usually cut the entire roll into slices and then cube the slices . a cubed roll fits perfectly in arubbermaid cup containerfor storage in the refrigerator .additional information you might find useful the redbarn manufacturing plant is located in great bend ks and their corporate offices are located in long beach ca .shelf life months . can be frozen for longer storage .redbarn beef food roll ingredients beef beef lungs beef liver wheat flour following ingredients account for egg product sucrose flax seed salt dicalcium phosphate natural smoke flavor calcium chloride sunflower oil dextrose citric acid potassium chloride choline chloride rosemary dl alpha tocopherol acetate iron sulfate selenium supplement zinc oxide copper sulfate vitamin b supplement niacin calcium pantothenate manganous oxide vitamin a acetate thiamine mononitrate riboflavin supplement d activated animal sterol source of vitamin d ethylene diamine dihydriodide pyridoxine hydrochloride folic acid supplementguaranteed analysis crude protein min crude fat min crude fiber max . moisture max crude ash max calcium min . phosphorous min . amount to feed inches per day dogs weighing less than lbs feed to per day dogs weighing lbs feed to per day dogs weighing lbs feed to per day dogs weighing lbs feed to per daycalories . per oz slice equals approximately oz we feed our betta a few pellets of this food every third day or so . he also getshikari bio pure freeze dried spirulina brine shrimp cubes for pets . ounce . we give him tubifex worms too .but back to these pellets . he loves this food . i ve read very good things about the hikari brand . given hikari s reputation i feel confident that i am feeding our betta some of highest quality food available .below is information about nutrient content ingredients fish meal wheat flour soybean meal rice bran gluten meal starch krill meal wheat germ meal brewers dried yeast dha oil spirulina dried seaweed meal dl methionine garlic astaxanthin grape seed extract choline chloride vitamin e supplement l ascorbyl polyphosphate stabilized vitamin c inositol calcium pantothenate riboflavin menadone sodium bisulfate complex source of vitamin k folic acid vitamin d supplement biotin disodium phosphate ferrous sulfate magnesium sulfate zinc sulfate manganese sulfate cobalt sulfate calcium iodate red artificial color guaranteed analysis crude protein min crude fat . crude fiber . moisture max crude ash max phosphorus min . 
general commentsdoes the job . radiant heat without light . my senegal parrot loves it . georgie s day cage is on an outside patio in south florida . i use the heat emitter perhaps days year when the temperature is between and degrees and cover the top of the cage with a large beach towel because cold windy in south florida . at night and below degrees during the day georgie stays inside .placementremember that this is radiant heat it bounces like light . i place the emitter about outside the cage about below the top that way with the top of the cage covered some radiant heat will bounce down from the cover to warm georgie s top side . his perch is perpendicular to the emitter about below the emitter so that georgie can choose how much warmth he wants by distance from the emitter . a nesting box is immediately below the perch that way heat can bounce upward from the top of the box to warm georgie s underside and the box itself absorbs some warmth in case georgie needs to retreat from a hawk cat or other perceived threat or just to nap . i am considering adding a second watt emitter solely to warm georgie s nesting box which would provide a toasty retreat even if the temperature drops unexpectedly . note that an ordinary cardboard box with a entrance hole can serve as a nesting box . or wattsthe watt is it is adequate for closed vessels such as gallon aquariums for which it is recommended . however even for relatively small uncovered cages it may not be sufficient . my guestimate based on use is that it would be adequate for a single small animal able to get within a few inches of the emitter in an open cage down to degrees perhaps degrees with the cage covered i .e . with a towel or blanket . if the ambient temperature is lower or the cage is large or contains many animals or it is impractical for the residents to get close to the emitter then maybe a watt or watt emitter would be preferred .zoo med repticare ceramic infrared heat emitter wattszoo med repticare ceramic infrared heat emitter wattssafetynote that the emitter itself of even a watt unit gets very hot and can badly burn your pet or your fingers even thought it may not feel very hot from away . be sure your pet cannot reach the surface of the emitter . and do not touch the surface to check if it is working .i suggest installing the emitter in a wire cage holder on the side not the top of your pet s cage or aquarium so that your pet can choose its own preferred amount of warmth by distance from the emitter .i suggest installing using a switch with an indicator light which will tell you whether the emitter is on or off without burning your fingers .plug in cord switch with reminder lightif your pet is a bird or otherwise a plastic chewer be sure to be sure that it cannot get at the electrical cord .i used these on the brutal winter of .they are great i would wrap it in the cover and also put a little blanked on top . they last warm for around hours enough for them to have a good night sleep .i also had some electrical pads for the coldest nights when it was under degrees .i bought two of these to give some warmth to my cat on cold days . my cat won t go near them . if i put one of them down near my cat my cat runs away . on the other hand i have found them to be great in my bed on cold winter nights . heating them at the maximum as warned on the label provides a good steady warmth i could have wished it a bit warmer . as others have noticed if the item is put outside in cold weather it certainly does not maintain its temperature for very long . the claim of twelve hours doesn t even hold if the item is put in my warm bed all night . so they are fine to heat up a cold bed but perhaps not great to provide emergency heat to animals outside .last note i overlooked the warning on the insert by accident and heated two of them in the microwave at the same time . in a low power microwave it takes eight minutes to heat one so heating two of them would be a project . as a consequence one of them melted and the inside stuff came out . i would have wished these a bit more durable at the maximum heat they are give off a nice warmth but that is all if you exceed this they self destruct .
after the battery is mostly charged this charger goes to . volts and starts boiling the electrolyte . normally when battery is mostly charged the voltage should not go that high ! ! ! the charger did not switch to a float mode either as it was supposed to .to make sure it is not a battery issue i tried to use this charger on different batteries and saw the same result . charger at . volts and boiling electrolyte . if i was not keeping a close eye on the charger it would have destroyed my battery by boiling out all electrolyte . i thought this thing is smart and automatic . did i also mention that one time i was tried to use the charger see above for results it was making a lot of loud noise because of a constantly running cooling fan .excellent battery tender . . . . . .keeps a constant charge on my battery . . . . . . . . .shuts off when it has powered up the battery . . . . . .really nothing to do but but turn it off when full .this is the cadillac of battery chargers . i put my miata on the charger each winter . doesn t overcharge the battery doesn t dry out the cells just works perfectly . it will even charge up a dead battery if you give it a few days . at this low amperage it isn t ideal for this but it will work .this is about . a new battery is about . leaving a battery discharging or not charging for a long time months kills the battery . do the math and you see you can t afford not to have one .
i installed these on a silvertone sd which is a dreadnought acoustic guitar . they are so much nicer than the strings that were on my guitar from the factory . if you are looking for a regular medium string these are real nice . great product .strings are not just strings . guitar strings are another very important part of playing great guitar . and all martin products are second to none .these d addario silk and steel strings are excellent for finger picking . a couple of notes though on the positive side they are made in the u .s .a . of american produced materials unlike silk and steel strings by a famous american guitar company whose name starts with m which are assembled south of the border on the negative side they cost more than m s silk and steel strings in general silk and steel strings squeak more on position changes than straight steel strings especially more than flat wound acoustic strings the tone is very nice and mellow sort of a cross between flat wound steel strings and nylon strings the d addario folk set is very easy on the fingers and therefore are ideal if you play a lot or if you primarily play a fairly light gauge electric string and only acoustic on occasion they really work best for finger picking whatever you do don t use metal finger picks and are less effective than steel strings for flat picking .
i m a little disappointed in hi lift jack . top is piece and welded in the middle . should have been one piece . they supplied a bolt rather than some sort of quick release pin to attach it . a bolt with a hand tightened nut will vibrate loose during transport . the hook on the bottom could have been a little deeper to grab onto other items other than round bumpers more securely . all in all a good add on for your hi lift jack but it could have been designed a little better .great tool for clamping hard to reach radiator hose clamps . its multi position locking mechanism will make sure to clamp and hold various sized clamps unlike other pliers that can only hold in the fully close position .i have two cars both of which require the large sheet metal self tapping screws to mount the plate to the nylon retainers behind the plate the ones mounted on the car that the screws screw into . problem is that diameter of the plastic ring that holds the screw covers is too small to take the screw s large diameter head . the maximum screw head diameter that will fit the ring is . inch millimeters . option replace the nylon retainers on the car but different cars have different retainers so one must search for new ones that will accept a screw . option try to find self tapping screws with smaller heads . i shopped around for screws with smaller heads to no avail . option grind down the screw head s diameter . option not good on one car i used sheet metal screws that have a smaller diameter but do fit the rings and wrapped the threads with tape . this sort of works but i really can t tighten them down satisfactorily . so i have to check their security now and then . i m leaving the other car as is for now . maybe someone has more practical ideas ? sure would like to hear of them . btw see the update below .update i think i ve found a viable solution to the above problem . i used a sheet metal self tapping screw placed a inch long piece of ordinary shrink tubing i .d . over the threads towards the pointed end of the screw . used a heat gun or you can use a match bic lighter or soldering iron to shrink the tubing which effectively increases the thread diameter to about that of a screw . this allows me to tighten the screw securely and will last much longer than ordinary tape . one more thing the thickness of the screw head doesn t quite allow the chrome cap to fully snap into place over the nylon ring . the top of the head needs to be filed down a little leaving enough philips x to use the screwdriver .
even after reading the negative reviews here of mirrors that fogged up and were uncleanable i decided to order one and try my luck . sure enough as soon as i opened the package i discovered a mirror that was so cloudy i couldn t even see my reflection .i called the manufacturer blue ridge international products in freeport fl and they told me there was a bad batch of mirrors produced but they ve found and fixed the problem and they d be happy to send me a replacement at no charge .they took my name address and phone number and said i should have it within days . if you run into the same problem i encourage you to call the company and request a replacement be proactive ! stars terrible product initially received which was an inconvenience but manufacturer s customer service was cheerful prompt and obliging .on the first use of this item a sliver of metal fell off . if i was not in a well lit room and paying close attention my week old could have gotten seriously hurt . to add salt to the wound i tried to return the item and i got two separate emails from the seller . the first email asked me to describe the defect . i responded to the email . after which i received a second email asking me to send a picture of the item seriously ! . do you think i am storing the sliver of metal to take a picture of it ? . if i described the defect as a sliver of metal the product would look the same as in the original picture of the item as a sliver denotes a very small piece so the seller already has a picture of what the product looks like . . if the seller needed a picture this should have been requested in the first email not in a second email . i shop online because i have limited time . i do not have time to respond to an email trail for a nail clip . however i am so irritated with the product and the seller s response that i decided to write this review . in addition my request to return the item was closed before the return approval process was completed !i purchased this item thinking it was bpa and phthalate free but it is not . it s never a good sign when there isn t even a recycling symbol on the item . we re trying to be as plastic free as possible so i returned it same day and plan to buy the eurobath as a replacement . i will say that diapers .com was exceptionally nice with the return . they provided a prepaid shipping label within minutes of my phone call to customer service .
these will not fit a jeep sahara unlimited just in case anybody wanted to know .if by chance if you have a jku you need a an oil filter . that number is a mopar .our local napa store could not bring up a part number for a new jeep ?exact fit for lexus rx . as easy to install as i could ve expected with all parts the sensor the cable and the plug matching the original layout .returned found better kit with colors that help match rv . you need kit with colors to match most applications .
i wanted a higher rating for my garage jack stands since they will be holding the beast up while i scurry about underneath . these fit the billl . the safety bar gives me a little extra confidence and the welds look ok to my untrained eye .these jack stands do what they are supposed to do . my disco is about lbs and they hold it just fine . my only advice is that you make sure you know your vehicle height . these jack stands are tall . i use them on the lowest setting on my disco and i still have to jack it up an inch or so to get it high enough to put these under . i will be lifting it soon though so that will change and hence the reason i got these . for a normal car though these would probably not be my first choice .also if you are using them on asphalt be aware that they might sink down into the ground a little . on concrete you wouldn t have this problem but asphalt is soft enough that the edges of the stands might cut through .finally be safe and get a good pair of wheel chalks to use .a very simple concept but someone had to be the first to invent it . i suspect others will soon imitate this .photos show lifting tires . no doubt it would work fine for that especially with heavy over size tires as shown or farm equipment tires . but it s good for so much more .a piece of steel under the corner of a small building set hooks under the steel and lift the building for re leveling . hook it under a mower deck of a riding mower to remove sharpen blades .you trust your jack now trust the accessories they provide so you can get the most from it . be sure to get the base for the jack better than carrying around a piece of x and no one will toss it on your camp fire either .
this partial capo from kyser has the same design construction and ease of use as kyser s top ranked and bestselling string cano . it is definitely recommended . if you choose to go down he partial capo path though it s best that you either jam with friends who are familiar with partial capos or buy randall wolliams manual on the partial capo since its use is not intuitively obvious .the planet waves tri action capo features a trigger action which makes it easy to put on and remove compared with any other style of capo i ve ever used . as the product description says it has a built in pick holder which certainly is not necessary but which is a feature that some users will find attractive . if the photo on the amazon product page looks confusing don t worry . what looks like a spring actually is a spring . the spring mecahnism is adjustable similar to the way that vise grips work . this capo is adaptable to guitars with various neck radius shapes and narrow neck standard acoustic guitars as well as acoustics with wider necks e .g . godin s seagull guitars . the only quibble i have and it s a minor one is that when you get the spring mechanism set up for one guitar you may need to adjust it when you switch instruments . once adjusted though the downward tension on the strings seems to work well with no fret buzz .what s to say ? it s not a high end capo and for the price i can lose it like most of the other capos i have owned . it s not a high quality capo and it does take a few adjustments to get it seated properly .
i have no idea what happened or if anyone else had this problem but i got literally plug ins and not the part where you can plug in an existing cable to make this into a chain . it s like i got an extension cord and male outlets on both ends . soooo it s pretty much useless to me . i guess if you get one of those power blocks with v outlets on them i guess you could plug this into it but i really see no point . i would ve shipped it back i lost the packaging and just wrote it off as loss . i think i payed like for it so whatever . i would recommend going to an actual music store so you can physically see both the male ends and the female end .i write and record my own music . i stink at writing drums . i don t play drums i don t really have room for a drumset and i really don t want to spend the money on a drumset to see if i can figure it out . this is a great program for non drumming one man bands like me . midi drums and the drum sounds from my yamaha keyboard just wasn t cutting it . it works with ableton live with no problems . tons of different grooves . it sounds like a real drummer on a real drumset . very easy to use .this issue with this bad boy is not quality features or design . this is a pedaltrain product and just like my pedaltrain this is a well made perfectly designed board that does exactly what it claims it will do it holds freaking pounds of guitar effects stuff . and that my friends is the problem .i am using a voodoo labs x power supply but had to also get a tripplite isobar outlet power strip that i drilled into the upper left corner to handle a couple of the extra pedals . i plug that into the wall and then use a homemade iec power plug in the voodoo . on the pedal i was able to fit jim dunlop volume pedals one is for the looper a crybaby wah tc electronic flashback x sparkbooster mojo mojo overdrive corona chorus hall of fame reverb ditto looper and the shaker vibrato . i also have the mxr flanger helicon harmony pedal for vocals a korg tuner and an electro harmonix pulsar tremolo . i know i know . did i mention this sucker is big ? i feel like they should name it the pedal porch . maybe i can put a few potted plants on it .so getting back to the question of whether or not you should get this behemoth i will ask you to ask yourself do i really need all these pedals ? if the answer is hell yes i deserve them all ! i worked hard for them and can now make awesome sounds ! ! then by all means knock yourself out . just don t get a hernia lugging it around and make sure you book venues with appropriate stage space . no joke .
works just like it needs to . perfect fit for the tailgate on my chevy when the oem clip busted .they do work . exactly as advertised . hane no fear on buying these . fit the chevy silverado wt tailgate rods .works great . fairly easy swap . just be aware the front window regulators are the same on whether you have a suburban or tahoe or one of their gm family members . not so for the rear regulators . the full size suvs rear doors are differrent from the smaller ones . the vehicle input feature amazon provides does not know this and will lead you to purchase the wrong ones if you are not aware of the difference . the pictures will reveal which you need if you have the old one to look at but the vehicle id feature will allow you to buy either and tell you it will fit . beware ! ! ! ! just so you know the dorman and fit the full size and the and fit the tahoe size vehicles .
the wall mount is very good adjustable so it fits my guitars perfectly . the screws anchors are poor . if you are not putting this into a stud go get you some better anchors . do not trust these to hold your guitar if mounted to drywall only .got this to put into my pseudo caster project guitar . love it ! be warned it does not come with springs claw or trem bar . if you order this get the tremolo bar for the mexican model . the threads are smaller on these .if you like to do dive bombs you will need to grind a bevel on a small portion this massive sustain block . it will hit the back of the cavity before getting anywhere near absolute floppiness .last important note . . . make sure you measure your outer pivot screw distance . if it matches spec on this trem all the screw holes will match up .with musical instruments standing about on my office floor i determined to find a better way to keep them available and so i decided to hang them on the walls . this hanger was very easy to install . it comes with screws and anchors so that it can be attached to drywall itself or through drywall and into wall studs . i used the pre drilled holes as a template to mark my wall and the hanger went in easily . but a word of warning use a level to align the hanger to a vertical position on your wall . if you don t your guitar will hang a bit cock eyed .
easy to install . it is mounted with screws and wall mounts so if you can t use those then find another one .the board is thin so the tacks to poke out the other side . the pins i am using just barely show through the back but it also depends on how hard you push the pin through as well .light weight and easy to hang .it does what it advertises but i mounted between two x inside the wall so it s harder to just pry it from the wall used long deck screws . as it is good whack with a hammer at it s flying of the wall .if you are at a desk for many hours a day then you really need a foot rest . also if your desk is higher than your normal position after adjusting your chair height then you need a foot rest .i am pretty normal height and most desks fit me without a foot rest but i love having this one . i use the foot rest as a change of position and it really helps when i can put one foot up or the other down or both on or both off . . you get the idea . this foot rest is solid and the all metal construction really is a big deal . the plastic type fall apart and are easily damaged . additionally the plastic can shift or move with very little pressure applied making them hard to use which is exactly what you don t want from a piece of ergonomic equipment . you want it easy to use to get maximum compliance .simply this is the best large surfacedurableeasy to usestays in place .
i ordered these for my water dragon habitat . the package arrived and when i picked it up it made a rattling sound . they had placed the bulb box in a slightly bigger box with absolutely no cushioning at all and no warning on the outside box of fragile contents . one bulb was completely shattered . the other worked . i put it in the fixture while i processed a replacement order because i needed a basking bulb right away . the second box came and nothing was shattered but one of the lights was a total dud and didn t even light up once .the other in that box worked fine . so i put the dud in the box with the shattered one and sent it back for the return and kept the working bulbs . next time i ll go to a local pet store so that i can return a dud right away if it happens and so i don t risk them shattering in transit .we had to run to a pet store right before christmas to buy a replacement . the one we purchased was constructed of thicker plastic . the one i received had a vertical crack through one of the large walls . i had to toss it but with amazons great policy i wasn t charged for the damaged product .this is not my first filstar filter . but it is my first xp l . all plastic parts . but my xp m has worked well even though its made the same way .but i received the xp l yesterday and when i opened the box i could see that it was packaged so poorly . lose parts rolling around barely anything wrapped or contained . when i took all the parts out of the box i inspected everything and right away saw that one of the plastic snaps on the outside of the canister was broken . basically this means that it might not be water tight . why would the top snaps be lose in the box in the first place let alone made of plastic ? makes no sense at all .instantly i thought of returning to amazon . but i noticed that there is an instruction sheet that stays stop before you send this product back call us at our number and we will help you out . so i called the number . you go to an answering machine . answering usually means someone listens to the messages and responds . still waiting . not to mention that the voice message says that for better service go to our website and you might find answers there too . then i went to the manufacturers website which is hard to navigate offers almost no advice or way to contact anyone for return parts etc . . . the website states the exact opposite from the packaging stop letter . it says that you need to call the number for faster service else it could be several weeks before they get back to you . lolis this a joke company or what ? this is the year nearly . the us economy has not really recovered and there are tons of canister makers out there . no wonder many companies with this poor of customer service go bankrupt . i would expect this one to follow suit too .though these are cheaply made you might get one that is whole . but if not you will have to deal with the worse customer service and lack of care of any company i have come across in the last few years . this will be my last api filstar filter . i will continue to wait with held breath for the elusive call or email back from this company .my final advice to everyone else is don t waste your time . there are better equally affordable alternatives out there . do not support a company that does not support you as a customer .update the mfg sent me an email asking if anyone called me yet ? really ? you don t know ? then they said that it would be faster if i just sent it back through amazon . ha ! in the normal business world it should be faster to go back directly through the mfg ! sending back today through amazon but never again buying anything from this mfg . ridiculous !
we have used frontline plus for seven years now and swear by it ! some other reviews said they received a product that was made outside the u .s . and the box numbers didn t match the batch numbers on the product . this was not the case for the ones they sent us . i am very happy with the swift shipping and quality of the product !i ordered the iris qt food storage container with casters . what i received was a bird seed dispenser . i realize mistakes happen so i returned it the same day in the original box along with a copy of my order for the storage container . instead of sending the right product i received an e mail saying they were refunding my credit card . no explanation for why they weren t sending the container no apology . and i m ripped off for the return postage of a little over eight dollars . i subsequently ordered an almost identical item on amazon from another company and am pleased with it . p .s . it was cheaper too !we purchased one of these tents a number of years ago and it is still going strong . this one arrived with cracked support rods different material than original and the plastic is stiff and brittle . contacted seller about rods and they promised to send replacement . after waiting quite some time seller advised that their supplier was out of these and issued a credit . nothing wrong with the seller other than slow on the follow up the product is just not the quality of the original models .
a one subject notebook with sturdy spiral binding . the pages can be removed due to the perforated edges . it also has a two sided folder in the front .five star spiral notebook college ruled is a staple for school or home . pages of college ruled notebook paper . front and rear covers are thick cardboard for keeping the paper clean and unbent . the covers are also water resistant .it also includes a thick two sided reinforced pocketed folder to hold papers and notes .great for students or around the house .i just gave mead some grief in a zipper binder over declining quality but won t be doing that here .the star notebook is still the workhorse i favored for my own use in college . my kids get a lot of the twenty cent cheapie notebooks that the office and department stores tout going into the school year but those notebooks have thin paper covers and wire spiral binding that starts to unravel early on .by comparison mead five star is the serious notebook whether for college or just as a recognition of your middle schooler high schooler s work ethic . front cover is plastic back very thick cardboard and the spiral binding is noticeably tough coated vs . wirey . it even has one high quality cardboard pocket inside the front cover for loose papers and the top edge of that pocket is reinforced with plastic .good on mead for keeping up the quality with their flagship product . now about those zipper binders 
you couldn t ask for a better diaper pail . one reason is that you don t have to use certain bags inside the pail . . .can use a plain trash bag and second is that once you turn the handle over you don t smell the dirty diapers . great product !this pail is not only good for disposable diapers but cloth diapers as well ! it s great that it doesn t require any special type of bag . you can put in a regular trash bag if you want or you can buy their refill bags . i use it with a pail liner for my cloth diapers .it does a great job of keeping the smells in . the only time i notice a smell is when i m opening it up to throw in a diaper or to change the pail liner .i like this product so much that i recommend it to anyone i know who s having a baby whether they are using disposables or cloth diapers !i would definitely recommend choosing the diaper champ over the diaper genie since you can use regular kitchen trash bags instead of expensive genie refills . definitely reduces the odor just be prepared for the awful smell when you open the top to change the bag ! ! ! and is easy to clean . love it ! ! !
these are just the right size and are clean when they arrive in the package unlike some that will sometimes have charcoal loose in the package .these little are guys are really small . you will have to buy the bag that goes with this . the bag from seachemthese treats are loved by my two small dogs .they clean there teeth very well and are economical due too the fact there are fifty to a bag ! ! !
nice high amp current rating on this . i epoxy it to a ah volt gel battery and i can use it as a jumpstarter oremergency power supply for camping or power outages .after a power outage i connected my refrigerator to this power supply . sadly its inverter was unable to support my refrigerator . the duracell dpp hd doesn t have enough momentary output to handle the initial start up current spike of a refrigerator s compressor motor . the specifications say it can momentarily provide up to watts . this equates to amps at v . yet public benchmark figures for a home refrigerator s start up current indicate amps for up to second . other appliances that use electric motors such as sump pumps are likely to exhibit the same characteristics . my suggestion is that customers immediately test this product with any device they intend to power during an outage .some important specifications are missing in the amazon listing . one of the key statics is the capacity of the internal battery which is amp hours at v . this equates to watt hours . yet ac output is much lower than this presumably due to inverter losses . these losses increase with power output . the following table illustrates this . the last column is my calculation .load . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .watts . . . .hours . . . .watt hourscordless telephone . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . portable stereo . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . laptop computer . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . fan . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . tv . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . drill . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . warm air fan heater . . . . . . . . . . . . . . blender . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . hid floodlights . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . observe that the total energy delivered watt hour drops with power consumption . ultimately the usable energy is significantly less than what is contained within the lead acid battery .for reference a refrigerator will use about watts of electricity when the compressor is running . typical consumers will have their refrigerator running about to of the time which equates to an average of watts being consumed continuously .consdoesn t handle current spikes associated with certain electric motorsprosboth ac and dc outputportablesimple operationbought this to attach to my car battery and black and decker bm b v v charger . it plugs in nicely and charges .
the quartet prestige colored cork board is a great standard bulletin board .the board itself is x feet in size and comes with all the hardware needed to install it . the board was packed well and there were no defects on inspection . the cork board is a neutral mid range black brown variety . as such it would fit in nicely with either dark or light wood furniture . the frame is what they call a graphite finish but the sides look more dark brown to me and the top and bottom are somewhat more grey . on the whole the board has a very professional appearance .this is a pretty standard installation nothing terribly difficult but it does take some careful measuring to make sure that the board is level . to install this you will need a light duty drill and a screwdriver . basically four identical anchors are placed in the wall . these are flat pieces with an edge curl to fit into grooves at the top and bottom of the board . you line them up to fit in a groove at the bottom an the top of the board . i anchored the bottom two firmly . the top two were reasonably tight but loose enough to move the anchor up and down there is a slot on each anchor for the screw not just a hole . you place the bottom of the board onto the anchors then fit the top ones in place . my first impression was that this would not be a strong enough way to anchor the board to the wall but the board seems rock solid and stays in place .the cork board works well with the usual pins and is considered self healing . on the whole the self healing which seems to be true as the holes form an average size pin seem to disappear when you remove the pin . the board works well although as you push pins into the center of the board you can feel a little bit of give as you push . so far this has not posed any problems .generally this is a handsome serviceable cork board that would work well in either the home or office . recommended .this whiteboard is very well made perfectly level and smooth as glass . the front and back surfaces are well bonded . the aluminum framing is very precise .simple to install snap the tray on use level to locate hangars . drill two holes insert anchors and screw in hangars hold board at degree angle and drop onto hangarsthere you have it ! hanging hardware marker and two magnets included to get you started . erases easily . hardware available for connecting multiple boards or for hanging on cubicle wall .amazon has a very nice selection of pens magnetic white board erasers and magnetic push pins .this is a nice set . . .fun colors that are bold and go onto the whiteboard nicely . i think though that the designers went a bit over the top and instead of producing just a good solid set of markers for personal use added too much . the mini erasers are ok but if you are like me you are likely to correct any errors by erasing with your finger before you remember that there is one built in .the biggest design flaw in this product is that the built in magnets aren t strong enough . they are barely strong enough to support the weight of the marker when attached to a whiteboard and are easily dislodged . they are small enough however to stay easily on the top of the whiteboard and the square head design keeps them from rolling off .all in all a good product but not quite star worthy .
this isn t a review of these strings so much as a warning or caveat for those of you playing guitars with floating bridges usually for a whammy bar and not using these heavier strings already .i wanted a little fuller sound than the slinky strings aka regular slinky and the idea of some driving base appealed to me so ordered the beefy s . i strung them up but had a hard time tuning the guitar . every time i got the higher strings in tune the lowers would go down as much as a half note . it took awhile to realize that my floating bridge was coming off the body as i tightened the strings . so i pulled the back plate off my strat and set to off tighten down the the tensions screws . i made about adjustments each time retuning the guitar to check my progress . the final time i tightened them down the high e string broke . since these were my only beefy s my day was done with these strings . however given how far i tightened the tension screws i think i would have had to purchase an additional tension spring not too expensive or difficult to install if you have the inclination to do it to get the bridge flush with the body .as i said this isn t a knock of these strings . i never really got a chance to play them . just a heads up for anyone moving up to these heavier strings . it can be quite a shock the first time your see your bridge sticking out at a degree angle to your guitar and if you aren t careful you can damage your guitar .these drops are not just a convenience . in my opinion they are a neccessity for beginning violinists . if you are reading this wondering if you should consider buying this product to stop your tuning pegs from slipping or to make them turn smoother and in less dramatic tuning jumps the answer is yes . buy this it does work and it works very well .even though the instructions said to put a drop on two different places on each peg i wanted to go light just in case so at first i only put drop on each peg . i didn t know what to expect and you can always put more on but too much could be a bad thing . also each instrument is different each peg is different . i had one very stubborn peg while the others were just the normal level of obnoxious about slipping . you may only need drop on some pegs and the reccomended drops on the others . i had new strings on which of course are going to take forever to stretch out and will need constant tuning . i did not remove the strings i just loosened the pegs a little and pulled them out a tiny bit one at a time then put the first drop on the spot where the peg would make contact when put back in on the tuning head side of the peg the part you actually turn . i put the nd small drop on the dead end of the peg not the end you turn . be careful when applying that you don t get more than small drop at a time . this stuff spreads out over time a tiny drop goes a long way . one bottle should last you a very long time .what to expect with one drop the effect is immediate . you will notice the pegs turn smoother and hold their position much better . after playing for awhile i decided to put a nd drop on each peg as suggested by the included instruction sheet . this helped them all to stay in place even better than before . the pegs now also turn smoother and easier and i can tune much easier than before in smaller more accurate adjustments and the strings actually hold the tuning for much longer than before .great product . buy it use it and be happy .when i first learned guitar my buddies kept telling me i d want a capo but i held out until just recently . the dunlop is secure doesn t scratch the guitar at all and holds the strings down as it should . instead of taking the time to adjust my tuning i can use this to achieve the tone i want . good item for the price .
the chuckit pro is worth every penny . my dog is very active and lets face it the dog owner does not always feel like an extended walk at the end of a long day . the chuckit does the job as i am able to stand or sit and exercise my dog . and most importantly my dog loves it .i love love the under ground fence . i got this little receiver for my new puppy . it is not so bulky and heavy so it does not scare the pup by its weight alone . this allows me to teach the pup early to get her used to the boundaries and also allows her the freedom to play with the older dogs with out me worrying weather she ll get into the road or not . you will have to buy their batteries but if you teach your dog early on how this works they ll respect the fence and you will hardly use any batteries at all .i purchased two of these car harnesses one for my lb shih poo pom mix coco and the other for my lb shih poo max . i like the fact that the harness is suitable both as a restraint in the car and for regular walks . however whereas it works well in the car for coco who sits quietly during car rides max always ends up tangled almost to the point of choking because the restraint does not accomodate him turning from one side to the other in the seat . many times i ve had to stop the car in order to untangle and release him and now i have had to resort to travelling with him on my lap or laying in the seat beside me without the restraint because it s too dangerous to use . so if you have a nice sedate pup this will work well but if your pup is likely to twist or turn even a little the easy rider will be hazardous .as a previous reviewer stated the design could be improved to accommodate the pup turning without getting tangled .
would recommend getting a size smaller than what the sizing chart recommends as i measure aroun my leg as recommended and the chaps were one size too large . . otherwise they are awesome quality and buildsizes listed in reviews and the two in the description . x . x and . x . x don t match to what i received . . .the bag i received is in between what has been listed in the descriptions . x x empty .while seemingly a good quality bag with a fair amount of straps and attached rain cover hidden in the heel of the bag it seems the manufacturer or seller has no idea how to use a measuring tape !the bag itself is quite nice . . . good padding rubberized bottom to prevent sliding small pockets on either side and zippers seem of reasonable quality .for the price and bag quality i m not complaining . it works great on my cb and it does fit on the pillion of my vt c without having to remove my rider backrest so if you have standard seating or a touring adventure style this bag will do well for you as a pillion bag and with a little strap adjustments it also fits vertical on the front or back of a sissy bar or horizontal on a larger luggage rack . . .need for each side works well for small pop up . buy these over ones w rope and add your own rope same choke . these already have the hole for rope . dimensions given are inaccurate on these two they are exactly the same size .
i love the whole avent system ! these are great sippy cups in large part because all avent pieces are modular and fit each other . so if you have been using avent bottles you can put the sippy cup tops and handles on the bottles .you can pop out the magic valve that makes this a sippy cup and fit in the nipple from the bottle . or you can take the collars from your bottles and fit the magic valve in it . it is wonderful ! especially since you have so many ways to fit the sippy cup together if you have already been using avent bottles .my kids are . years and . years respectively and both enjoy using these take and toss cups . the lids stay on tightly and the liquid inside is easy enough for kids to drink out of . there are no valves to clean the cup itself is easy to clean and the optional caps are great for capping the cup while in a bag . this cup however is not completely leak proof when on its side and if you have kids who shake the cup while it s upside down you will have drops of liquid coming out of the cup . thankfully for us our kids keep the cups upright and are beyond the cup gnawing phase these cups are perfect for our family .that said this cup is probably not the best for beginning cup users or kids who still like to throw cups around but are great for those who are just trying to learn how to walk around with a drink and may sometimes drop a cup by mistake .i have been using these continuously for over years and they make a great everyday straw cup that you don t have to worry about losing and having to replace . for those concerned these are coded for recycling and many municipalities don t recycle plastics . luckily ours does . we found that the other take toss style with the vented spout the first years pack take and toss spill proof cups ouncehad two problems it leaked when tipped over enough to cause carpet stains and our daughter got frustrated by how long it took to drink an appreciable amount through those tiny vent holes . they really were the worst of both worlds !the straw cup style is great though . i use them myself . my daughter now still likes them . most of them have survived years of top rack dishwashings . the cap snaps on tightly and the straw forms a pretty snug seal with the hole in the cap . the straws are as tough as the cups but if they do get chewed or mangled ordinary soda straws work fine in these cups . and hurrah ! huzzah ! there are only straightforward parts to the cup cap straw and cup . no fussy little valves to clean .the straw cups come in a ounce or ounce size and i d suggest skipping the ounce . the ounce is light enough for a baby to hold while still containing enough thirst quenching liquid for older kids .however i took off one star because these are not good cups for toddlers under . both our kids tended to remove the straw and dump the cup s contents all over the place until they got old enough that this trick was no longer interesting . they also didn t quite get the concept that the straw has to stay fully inserted or it won t work . so we stuck with playtex twist lock straw cups until they were .
these pads are very absorbent and certainly serve the purpose but they don t look very good after you wash them . for the price i suppose you can t expect much but the carter s lap pads wash much better . if you are going to get some use them under things and buy the white ones . the colors seem to show the pilling more . i use them under the bassinett sheet now . i used to use them on top of the changing pad but my baby is only months old and they already look quite old .before my son was born two weeks ago so i can t really say much about long term durability we got a pack of these a pack of regular washcloths and a pack of special baby washcloths to try out as wipes with our cloth diapers and the hospital sent home a pack of regular disposable wipes so we ve gotten to do some comparisons and this is the product i m back ordering more of . the size is ideal for a newborn bottom we use them folded in quarters and they re thin enough to poke an edge into all the unmentionable wrinkles where babies need to be wiped but thick and sturdy enough to do the job once they get there . they re also nice and soft and absorbent . we use plain water with a few drops of baby wash to wet them down for use and wash with the rest of the diaper stuff regular detergent no fabric softener adding a half cup or so of white vinegar to the final rinse to get rid of residue and keep everything soft and absorbent . works great .if you re preparing for your first newborn i d recommend getting at least packs of these depending on how often you want to wash diapers also pick up a pack of regular cotton terry washcloths for the changing table especially if you re having a boy since those do work better as emergency shields during changes than these do . drop one of those into strategic position do your cleanup with these when folded in quarters you can even use the clean side to blot dry afterwards or grab a fresh one they re soft enough they don t rub bottoms raw like regular washcloths and you re good to go .for you crafty types yes these are just squares of flannel with serged edges so of course you can make your own but these are good heavy duty flannel and well made and really who has that kind of time ?i rec d these as a shower gift in a pack years ago .i loved them so much i bought more used ones on ebay .i now have a new baby . i tried a couple of other aios like home made patterns fuzzibunz and dappi and these are my favorites .you do need a cover they are a very absorbent puffy comfy cotton . i recommend thirsties original not the duo wrap because they fit great and don t gap .the diaper itself is very plush and cozy . i use prefolds during the day th generation for traveling out and about errands running and these at night for pee catching .they are fantastic . they fit a very smallish baby to a medium sized tot and they are softer with use and washes if that is possible . i love the insert flat for doubling but so far i haven t even needed a doubler with them kid is just short of months old . i like how they wash open just attach the velcro tabbies so they don t catch on delicate clothes . i hang them dry most of the time but sometimes i will tumble and then hang dry if i need theme faster .i think is a good number of these to have for solely night use especially if you use different diapers during the day they will take you through several months and is good for getting you to your next wash .i also like the cute prints .highly recommend .
you can buy pens and lighters from anywhere anybody but bic has a reputation that is second to none but parker or sharpie .but we know what a review is about for the p r i c e . . . you cannot buy a better i n e x p e n s i v e lighter or pen anywhere !why this belated review ? i feel very obliged to share my views about this old workhorse the hp c gold at its th anniversary and my oth year as a satisfied ower user and fan . especially after sharing my frank views on amazon about two of its three successors on amazon .com burying the hp c platinum st release hp cp and praising the hp c platiunum anniversary edition rd release hp cpae or hp cpa .to the majority of hp c calculator owners and fans including the non techkie nerd like myself the name hewlett packard to the majority of hp c calculator owners and fans . the brandname of hewlett packard is synonymous with the highest quality and best range offered in handheld electronic business financial calculators before the first generation of personal computers hits the desktops of business users .to date december the bearer of this gold standard is none other than the hp c hp s golden boy in its calculator business segment .the hp c now a matured product is the only continuing hp handheld surviving calculator product since and probably the longest selling electronic calculator ever . according to hp almost million hp cs cps was sold since it is probably the best selling hp and rpn calculator ever .as a proven product the hp c gold works from day with its form factor and sofware remaining unchanged and has not been dethroned by rivals and even its hp successors which had come and go .even with pc software versions being sold the c remains the truly indispensable portable finance business heldheld computer for its owners professionals and students alike . this handy companion powers up immediately and is faster than any portable personal computers to jump right into the action .the hp c is a serious product and the ultimate time tested solution field tested proven by its users and survived all its rival products the workhorse moves on .anyone in charge of this hp line should always bear in mind that the continued production run of the hp c is a testimony of hp s quality and standard expected by its customers .don t just listen to a hp c fan here i own and am using three out of models of the hp c series and it is amusing and somewhat disappointing to observe that it had taken hp at least four years and two major upgrades of the hp c platinium in its futile attempt to fix retire the hp c with three successors in the form of hp cplatinum since .it would seems especially frustrating on the part of hp to realize after all the effort spent on remaking the hp cplatinum models that it would not outdone its siblings the hp bii and hp bii series to seriously challenge the hp c gold . however by their own rights the hp bs and hp bs and the hp cplatinum may find their rightful place in the hp financial calculator line differentiating the hp c gold in terms of price and functions .imho this had happened because the following golden rules were infringed by hp . . .golden rule i a product which still sells itself is never obsolete .golden rule ii if it aren t broken don t fix it ! the gold rule of thumb should always be guarded as gospel by the hp heldheld calculator product team . based on the same reasoning the hp c s built quality and product standard is paramount to its users .golden rule iii always listen to your customers ! if in doubt see rules i ii .golden rule iv only outsource the manufacturing of your product to someone who could better your own product quality . if in doubt ask ibm about lenovo .golden rule v the benchmarking industry standard for this product line is the hp c . just in case if hp does not know or is not listening to its customers .golden rule vi do not discontinue the iconic hp c gold . hp needs no reminder that the customer is always right . please let your customer the ultimate market force decide if the hp c should ever be retired .as an ardent fan of hp c and line of financial business scientific calculators i am of the view that the day when hp discontinue the hp c would be the day it exit this business segment . i speculate this would happen when the hp brandname disappears from the c just like after ibm name had disappeared from thinkpads and thinkcentres .since the price of gold is on the rise it is indeed puzzling to fans of the hp c why hp did not release a genuine hp c gold th anniversary model for the fans to mark the occasion if replacing the discontinuing the hp c gold is the intention read all golden rules above .to be fair the silver hp c platinum anniversary is very nice and has spotted the retro silver look of the hp c however it is still not the gold standard . with hp missing this golden opportunity to mark the occasion i would love to see and own a hp c engraved with th anniversary logo reckon that this would be the ultimate testimony for the hp c and a milestone for its fans .looking forward a gold th anniversary hp c anniversary model would be very nice for the fans .for hp this is a lucrative business proposition . by now they would have realized that if they have any of its products which could hit a th year home run in it would not be from its other product line it would be this original hp c gold standard bearer . so please treat the old workhorse with the upmost respect !this canon p dh v color mini desktop printing calculator is one of the best office products i have ever purchased
i actually am one of those moms who bought a fancy travel system but i ended up sticking it in the closet and using this stroller most of the time ! it is so much more convenient . initially i bought the snap n go just for travel to accomodate the car seat provided by the rental car company but i loved it so much i kept using it at home . i can grab it out of my trunk and it literally falls open ready to go don t worry there is a clip to keep it closed for when you need it ! . so incredibly easy . don t underestimate how much you will appreciate having a cup holders that actually accomodate different sized containers b a tray area for your keys cell phone etc . c a huge basket so you don t have to cram everything under the stroller d wide set wheels so you won t constantly be kicking the stroller when walking e great turning smooth rolling f a stroller you don t have to fiddle with for minutes to get your carseat attached . it really is a great product . only downside . . . .hard to find a solution for shading the sun . note . . .obviously this stroller has no educational value ! but i m being forced to provide a rating for all categories so i ll just give it a for everything . these are easy to put on and take off . they work well to connect two umbrella strollers . the rubber inserts do fall out easily so i can tell these may not last long . they only work with one thickness of bar so they are not compatible with all strollers . i use a combination of these for the top connection and a different brand for the bottom that are adjustable since my stroller bars are wider at the base and i connect in places instead of for a sturdier connection .i went to babies r us convinced i would purchase the graco stroller frame to go along with the graco car seat i had . same manufacturer . . .should work right ? wrong . two other shoppers at the store had the same problem . . .the graco frame just doesn t open easily . babytrend s frame is lightweight easy to put together and a breeze to open and close . and best of all it is cheaper which is a bargain considering you ll only use the frame until the baby can sit up mo . . after that your baby will want to sit up and look out at the world .
if you own an american strat or tele this is a must have for the neck of your prize . i love this . it proudly states the guitar s origin of corona . california with the classic fender name scribed . wonderful . i have these on all three of my fenders . again these should really come standard on all american strats .this device sounds okay its usable . but you should plan ahead if you re in the usa and want one it ships from mainland china it takes a while to get to the states .i am upgrading my chinese fender strat with american hardware . i own an american strat too and plan on making the best of the chinese one . going to upgrade electronics and everything else too .these are exactly what s on my american strat stars
very well finished everything except rubber is made of aluminum with little bit of metal i guessnot like other reviewer said it fits in your hand comfortable does not need lot of strength to openit may be hard for old man or kidalso rubber doesnt smell that bad ! i mean it does but its not seriousthey also used glue to stick rubbervery comfortable strap . the cotton is soft and does not cut into my neck like some nylon straps do . seems sturdy and is holiding up well so far .this gigbag is a very tight fit for my epiphone les paul . their is minimal padding so it is little more than a dust cover . i tossed it aside and bought a fender gigbag . the fender is heavily padded and gives me some serious protection .
i have the original safer bather and i m thinking about purchasing this item and the reviews so far have been very helpful however i have a few questions i m hoping other reviewers can answer who own this . the original is more of a cushion and the material mildews after a while do the beads in this one do the same or is it a different material ? . how long does it take to dry ? . at what age would you recommend this product ? would it be appropriate for a month old who can t sit on his her own ?the reviews that say this product is soft are all pretty old isn . recent reviews all agree that the product is not soft . somewhere down the line they must have tried to save some money and made this product . i wouldn t sleep on this so will not use it for my son s crib . as far as protecting the sheet it probably does what is says . . .but i ll never know since i m returning it .after reading all the reviews on line for this product i chose to register for it now that i am using it i am disappointed . i m not sure if my sense of smell is just that of super hero s or my daughter has super smelly diapers . either way her room does have the smell of dirty diapers when you enter and the champ is in the back corner of the room . i guess i m just grateful that the whole house doesn t smell as bad as her room .
i have seen this type of dual check tire inflator with gauge at many service stations . no more airing up then change to a gauge to read the pressure . gets tiring if you are checking all the tires on an rv . with the build in gauge you get the reading constantly as you put air in the tires . this is going to be my main tool for the rv .two cars and motorcycle plus one in garage for my compressor refills . bought this one on faith because so many liked this michelin . getting a good seal on valve most immportant and accuracy of course . this one seals easiest . that is the best feature . tenths of one psi is also handy if measuring cold tire . bulk weight and size less handy if in glove compartment ? lots of other things in there .i keep this one in garage . for me with three vehicles and ten tires the pressure memory not helpful . the light might be nice . weight and bulk in my xl hand feels perfect when pressing on tire valve . that is what the weight is there for ? please let me suggest something for those who get their oil changed at those quickie places . part of their service is to check you tire pressure . that is very bad for your tires . you have to drive there for the oil change . your tires likely warmed up .they decided tire pressure was too high and let air out . finally noticed tire profile looked low . shocked to see almost ten pounds low when cold . damn ! that is damaging if driven on freeway for long miles . overheats tire and wears faster .tire pressure should always be check when cold . yes it will go higher with driving . that is taken into account when manufacturer or car manu . recommends pressure setting . no matter how high when hot always check pressure when cold . jiffee lube and others have good intentions i hope but tell them not to change the tire pressure with warm or hot tires . . . . . . . . . . . . .and that s the truth lolthis is the perfect tire pressure gauge for checking tire pressure accurately quickly and easily . simply put the end over the valve stem hold it firmly for a second or two and read the pressure . the gauge on the new tire pump is not correct and neither is the pressure gauge on the electric tire pump that attaches to the cigarette lighter . i highly recommend the accutire ms digital tire pressure gauge .
this was great until it wasn t . even though i had the problems with the noisy impeller after i put a little vasoline on it it stopped the noise . everything was fine until i came home today to do my weekly maintenance and the filter was dead ! i know it was working last week when i did a water change but i have no idea when it quit working . fortunately i have two filters running so my fish are ok . this filter only lasted six months so i m very disappointed .i like using mecury vapor bulbs instead of having a separate heat source and uvb lamp . i ve had this bulb for a few months now and it s still going strong .alright so this has everything to be a great filter flow adjuster bio media filter sponge charcoal and to top it off it s a great price . the only problem is that it s loud as heck ! i had to return it because i keep my aquarium in my room and there is no way i could sleep with the noise . actually the noise bothered me even when i was awake in the room . it sounds like a knocking noise coming from the motor . i disassembled it and cleaned the motor and impeller but to not avail . so i ended up returning it . i guess i m gonna stick with my tetra whisper filter . although the tetra also has its downfalls it s at least as quiet as its name suggests . i give the aquaclear stars because it has all the right stuff but not the right noise level . there s also the possibility that i got a faulty product even though i have read countless forum entries about the same problem . anyway keep this in mind when you consider purchasing !
hp practically wrote the book on small home office and large business printing and document management and it shows with the laserjet . i have had some less than stellar experiences with other hp printers inkjet and laser but have generally been satisfied with them . i have of these sitting around my office and have used the lj a lot and have grown quite fond of it .first it s small under inches wide inches thick and inches tall so it fits on a desk perfectly . it also weighs about lbs so it s lightweight . this is a laser printer so it takes toner . the toners last a long time and are pretty inexpensive less than which is about the same price as a single inkjet cartridge that won t last as long . it s made mostly of high strength polystyrene and abs plastic so it s tough and will last a long time . there are s in use today after almost years of constant use and tens of thousands of pages . the printer is connected with a usb only so there s no network card for connecting to a network . that s not too much of a hassle though if you must print over a network since you can set up printer sharing and use it from another pc on the network . it s super simple to use . there s no complicated settings to fiddle with just two buttons to print a status configuration page cancel a job and led indicator lights for print and printer status attention go and ready . there s a simple on off switch on the back that s out of the way and maybe a little inconvenient to use .on the hardware side the lj has a mhz processor and mb of ram for caching documents and quick spooling . although it s not major caliber hardware it s good enough for a small office or for a workstation needing a printer that can t access to a networked printer . hp says that a toner will be good for pages and jobs per month . i can concur that but you may be able to stretch it even further with higher capacity toners . changing the toner is very easy .the software aspect of the printer helps it out with some very useful features . setup wasn t too hard but isn t seamless . also you get a power cable but hp doesn t include a usb cable . seriously ? the cable costs and you can t include one in a printer ?a word on drivers . . .there is no driver for this printer available from hp for windows . kind of annoying but you have to tell windows to install it from it s list of compatible drivers when you re ready to install it . the software set can be used with a pc or a mac some features aren t available on a mac at the time of the s introduction but i don t use this with my mac so i can t comment includes utilities and customizable features such as pre formatted watermark confidential draft and others duplexing manual that s helped by images on the print utility showing how load the paper it prints on brochures and documents . there s a fold out priority tray for printing single documents or on envelopes or labels . the main tray holds sheets of letter paper . the priority tray handles pages at a time .performance is good . we use a few of these for printing documents packing slips invoices and shipping labels . i saw ish pages per minute with the first page out in under seconds . not bad ! my dell takes about minute to warm up and calibrate before the first page is out from idle . the fuser is always on so there s no warmup period like on other laser printers . however if you re doing volume printing the speed will slow down quite a bit to prevent it from overheating since there s no fan to keep things cool . that s actually an advantage as the sips electricity and is really quiet . the printing noise isn t obtrusive but it s not real quiet either . print quality is on par with others in the class i ve noticed . dpi that can be bumped to using the configuration utility . i noticed a difference but it wasn t huge . tiny font is legible but not super chrisp unlike regular fonts which look really nice . graphics also come out really nice although this isn t a high res printer and doesn t print high res graphics .pros compact and lightweightaffordablefast first page outdecent print quality for graphics . excellent for text .quietlow power consumptioneasy to useincluded software makes the printer very versatile with useful featurescons low duty cycle of jobs monthno windows drivertoner could last longerpaper tray only holds pagessome windows software utilities aren t available on mac sno usb cable in the boxno cooling fan so print output drops during large jobsoverall a very nice office or even home machine . compact with good performance the might be discontinued but is still an excellent laser for the money . we love it .this printer may be an ink hog i ll reserve judgment on that but the setup to connect the hp printer to my router via ethernet cable and use it wirelessly with my apple macbook running os . . .for over a year i ve been unable to use my old network printer setup due to changes in apple s software though it could be a configuration issue with my home network my failure to sacrifice a goat before reinstalling the print server or the phase of the moon who knows ? . at any rate i decided that this printer would be the best solution to the problem considering the age of my old hp .the new all in one has a considerably smaller footprint on the desk though it is a less sturdy machine than the old pound tank . i had installed the software from hp s website the night before the printer arrived so the actual setup took less than minutes and the printer was recognized immediately .print quality is excellent even at the most ink stingy quality .i bought this samsung printer to replace my college age daughter s brother laser printer to work with her macbook . the samsung s price small size and company reputation convinced me to get this and i m glad i did . the printer comes with two cds one for windows vista and one for non specified os which definitely contains the drivers for macs os x . and up . windows me nt and several linux os red hat fedora core mandrake . . and suse . . are also supported . i was able to get the printer up and running on two different macs with different versions of os x within minutes .a power cord paper dust cover and a laser toner cartridge are also included . customers will have to purchase separately a usb to printer cable such as belkin f u pro series hi speed usb cable six feet or use whatever they use now to hook up their computer . the speed is decent up to ppm and the quality is typical monochrome laser . although it is a little noisy on start up this compact laser printer prints smoothly and relatively quietly once it gets going .don t expect heavy duty construction . it weighs a lot less than most laser printers and the price reflects it . still this creates a high quality end product for those on a budget or with limited shelf space . also look at brother hl monochrome laser printer debbie lee wesselmann
my order came from the witz and sons fulfilled by amazon .i ve bought hp ink through amazon for years and never once had an issue . this time what i received was questionable .the product is advertised as being in retail packaging and the photo shows an hp package .however when i opened the amazon box what was inside was not in an hp retail box . instead the ink cartridge arrived unboxed . there was no hp cardboard box . it arrived in only the hp inner foil package . that means there was no hp box no upc and of course no explicit expiration date listed .the only thing on the package outside of the hp logo is a foil code . in my case the foil code is sg . i happen to be familiar with the codes on hp foil so reading the two sets of six numbers in yymmdd format i was able to see that what i was sent had an ink warranty that expired about months ago back in august and was produced in february of .while many people use ink past the warranty date that should be the choice of the consumer . here it seems likely the seller removed the box to try to pass off a old product as fresh which is deceitful at best .i have tried two hp laserjet compatible toner cartridges for my hp laserjet and both were substandard and had to be returned for a refund to different companies . one froze my printer as soon as i put it in . the other printed unevenly . i now will only purchase original hp toner cartridges for my machine .i am always wary of ordering ink for my printer online . according to reviews what is shown is not always what is received . these were factory sealed exactly as shown in the picture original canon . very happy .
i love how the bristles are still soft enough . my dogs love this brush also its such product . thank youi have little yorkies and they are really enjoying these chews . they are great for their teeth gums and jaws and they keep them occupied for a long time .my two dogs get their teeth brushed every morning and look forward to it . they don t really care for the mechanics of toothbrushing but they love the flavor of the toothpaste . their vet continues to be impressed by how healthy their teeth and gums are !
easy to put on . only put tape at top and not sides if it isn t a perfect angle . our fireplace is made out of stone pieces so it is uneven on sides . it still stays with tape only on top holding it on . colors are true to actual look .i purchasedkidkusion kid safe banister guard because in our built townhouse gaps between balusters are wide enough for our one year old to fall through . i originally was going to use acrylic sheets plexiglas but what i saw at a local home depot was too thick and expensive .installation the installation of the kidkusion kid safe banister guard was easy and the plastic seems durable enough to serve for at least a few years . i was able to cut it easily with a utility knife and a metal square . there was enough product included in the box to do all of the areas in my townhouse that were unsafe for my son .included in the box are a hole punch a bunch of white plastic ties a few plastic grommets screws and wall anchors to secure end s of the banister guard to a wall if needed . i bought a pack of black plastic ties at harbor freight tools because wrought iron on my stairs is painted black and the included white ties would stand out . i did not use the hole punch because it can make holes only about from the edge of the plastic and for my installation it would not work so i just used my utility knife to make small slits for plastic ties .to be considered . i was unpleasantly surprised by the fact that the leading edge was not cut squarely at the factory . when i measured the same distance from both corners of the leading edge and tried using a square to connect the marks i noticed that the cut would not be at a right angle . therefore i had to cut the leading edge square first and re measure . . when i imagined installed product i thought of it as being practically invisible . however even though i installed the plastic as tightly as i could it still has some unevenness to it that causes reflection and distortion and makes it noticeable although this is an aesthetics issue which is not as important as my child s safety .conclusion overall kidkusion kid safe banister guard satisfied my requirements it provides the safety i needed for my child it is relatively inexpensive it seems durable it is easy to install .frame is cute . it has real weight to it so it doesn t feel or look cheap at all . note that it can only be used for verticle pictures because the images on the sides are set to be vericle .
i had hoped to be able to breastfeed in this carrier but it just keeps the baby s head so tight my son could never relax enough to eat . in order to have it tight enough to hold him up he was squashed against my chest . i m hoping it will work better as a toddler carrier once he has head control .our baby s umbilical cord stump fell of when she was just a few days old so we bathed her in this tub . she was too tiny for her arms to fit in the arm places but it worked perfectly because she fit snugly and securely in the place that the body is supposed to go . baby won t slip under the water because of the plastic mouldings so you can have both hands free to wash and reach . once our baby was big enough to sit up we put her on the other end toddler end and she plays and splashes while still having the plastic molding so she can t slip back into the water . she s months old now and we fill the tub to the brim in the big bathtub . this is a large baby tub but it stores easily in the bathtub cleans up very easily and you will be able to use it for years at least ! well worth the extra .this was such an upgrade from our last bath tub my daughter is months old and on the big side for height and weight . this tub is so large but in a good way . i d just like to forewarn you do not need to put too much water into this tub since they are reclined so deeply into and the only con is there isnt any grips on it so once your kid finds out how much fun it is in this tub they can jump around and thus slip around a bit not bad but wanna keep a close eye on them .
